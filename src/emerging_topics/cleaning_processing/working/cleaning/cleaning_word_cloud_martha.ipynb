       " 'dru: integrated optimization of evacuation and sheltering for hurricanespi: rachel davidson, university of delaware (ud). participating institution: cornell university.abstractthe goal of this project is to improve understanding of and decision support for evacuation and mass case sheltering in hurricanes. the task of moving tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from a wide geographic area in only a few days or hours under uncertain, dangerous conditions, getting them to safe locations, and keeping them safe until they can return home is an extraordinarily complicated process, and as hurricane katrina made abundantly clear, the stakes are high. despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions assure us that many challenges remain. the traditional, conservative approach of evacuating everyone thought to be at risk is no longer feasible in many areas in which there are simply too many people and too little transportation capacity. we propose a fundamentally new approach. in the past, math modeling in this application has been limited to estimating the time required to clear a region, assuming many characteristics of the problem are uncontrollable input (e.g., shelter locations). instead, we will develop sophisticated optimization models with an expanded decision frame that focuses on higher-level objectives, such as minimizing life loss, cost, and inequity, and considers the full range of strategic and operational evacuation and sheltering strategies in meeting those objectives, including for example, vertical evacuation and strategically locating shelters. these models will be developed through a tight interaction between sociologists and engineers to ensure they are firmly grounded in the reality of people?s behavior. for the first time, the models will be based on individual hurricane scenarios instead of conservative aggregations of many events, and they will be dynamic, accounting for the fact that officials can update their decisions as an event unfolds and information about the situation changes. the project has 5 main steps: (1) determine a set of hurricane scenarios for use in evacuation and shelter models such that they appropriately represent the full range of possible events, but are few enough to allow detailed analysis with each; (2) conduct focus groups of key decisionmakers and stakeholders to identify and characterize appropriate decision objectives, constraints, assumptions, and possible evacuation and shelter management strategies; (3) using the focus group input, develop two mathematical optimization models?one long-term strategic and one short-term operational?for evacuation and sheltering decisions; (4) conduct surveys of affected citizens to ensure that the optimization model assumptions and results make sense; and (5) demonstrate the models through case studies in north carolina and florida. any evacuation and sheltering planning effort is only as effective as its weakest link, so it requires a broad range of expertise from marine science, transportation engineering, risk modeling, optimization, and behavioral research collaborating closely. we have assembled this expertise on the project team.this project will help begin to transform the way hurricane evacuation and sheltering are conducted in the u.s., addressing many of the known limitations of the current approach. the new understanding and optimization models developed in this project will help local and state emergency managers better plan for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, thus reducing the deaths, injuries, and unnecessary expense associated with poorly planned or executed response in future hurricanes. by collaborating throughout the project with state and local emergency management departments and the american red cross, the key agencies in charge of hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we will ensure that study results are disseminated to practitioners as quickly and effectively as possible. three graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research, each with at least two of the co-pis on their committees to ensure tight integration. by providing a substantive example of truly interdisciplinary disaster research, the project will help facilitate the transformation of the well-known disaster research center, historically based in sociology, into an interdisciplinary center. it will also help to launch the new interdisciplinary graduate program in disaster science and management at the university of delaware.',\n",

       " \"the overall goal of this project is to reconstruct the low-frequency behavior of the climatological aleutian low on decadal to millennial time scales, and to assess how its variability has related to past shifts in the mean state of climate during the holocene. to confidently reconstruct past climate change, the inter-related processes that control the proxy climate indicators must be well understood. this project will continue on-going monitoring and lake-core-based investigations at nine lakes in southern alaska with the dual aims of (1) understanding the primary controls on the sedimentary changes, and (2) applying this understanding to generate the highest quality time series of paleoclimate proxies that relate quantitatively to summer temperature and winter precipitation. the investigators recently discovered two lakes that contain annually laminated (varved) sediment. these are among the few varved lakes currently known in alaska, and they present an opportunity to develop annually resolved time series of past climate variability. the low-frequency component of lamination thickness and grain-size variability at these glacier-fed lakes probably reflects the extent of ice cover in the catchment, while inter- and intra-annual variability is likely related to melt-season temperature and hydrologic factors, particularly large rainfall events. in addition to the new laminated lakes, this project will generate complementary records from lakes more suitable for ecologically based proxies, including chironomid and pollen/macrofossil assemblages, and lake-productivity indicators that respond to growing-season temperature. in addition, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms will be analyzed to reconstruct moisture-source variations, and geomorphic evidence will be used to assess holocene glacier fluctuations within the lake catchments. the intellectual merit of this study includes its multi-proxy approach designed to probe a key feature of ocean-atmospheric circulation in the north pacific: the aleutian low pressure system. this prominent center of action is linked to indices of climate variability across the pacific. it is most strongly expressed in winter when it steers southwesterly storms inland, thereby governing the spatial pattern of surface temperature and snowfall across northwestern north america. this project includes glacier and glacial-lacustrine records because glacier size depends on winter precipitation, which varies with the aleutian low. glacier size also depends on summer temperature necessitating complementary time series of summer temperature. the basic study design is to pair a glacial-fed lake (lamination record) with an organic-rich lake (chironomid record) in each of three study areas separated by 2100 km: adak (middle aleutian islands) in the far west, ahklun mountains in the southwest, and chugach range in the gulf of alaska. these three areas straddle the prominent dipole in the influence of the aleutian low. when the aleutian low strengthens, winter precipitation and temperature increase in the gulf of alaska, while it decreases in the west. moisture sources also shift with the aleutian low, and these are recorded in the oxygen-isotope ratios of lake water and the diatoms that grow within it. the multi-proxy time series will extend through the holocene, with higher-resolution analyses over two periods that encompass past warm intervals, namely the holocene thermal maximum, which took place early during the current epoch, and the last 2000 years, which includes the so-called medieval warm period, a key benchmark for 20th century warmth.the broader impacts of this study involve its synergistic activities with resource managers at us fish and wildlife service who are developing a premier environmental monitoring program in the togiak national wildlife refuge, geoscientists at the us geological survey's alaska volcano observatory who are striving to assess the frequency of eruptions of aleutian arc volcanoes and to identify widespread tephra-stratigraphic markers, and the broader community of multi- and inter-disciplinary scientists aiming to understand the causes and effects of climatic change around the north pacific, the arctic, and globally. this project contributes to understanding climatic variability, a key challenge facing society. the us climate change science program identifies  past climate variability and change in the arctic and at high latitudes  as one of its primary research objectives. the project is training three graduate and several undergraduate students in global-change research, and supports a research assistant professor in her early career. the pis have involved high school science teachers in their field research as part of nsf's polartrec program.\",\n",

       " 'over the past century, rapid growth of human population and the human economy has transformed landscapes around the world.  these transformations have reduced and fragmented natural habitat, resulting in loss of biodiversity and many ecosystem services.  maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while meeting the needs of human society for food, fiber, fuel, and other essentials requires integrated assessment of the biological and economic consequences of land use and land management.  this interdisciplinary research project will develop and apply an integrated dynamic landscape-modeling approach to predict and compare how alternative policy incentives and market forces affect land-use decisions; how resulting land-use changes affect species conservation, carbon storage, and the value of commodity production; and how this will affect future land-use decisions.  the investigators will approach these questions by developing statistical models based on observed landowner behavior in order to predict likely land-use changes as a function of current land-use conditions, public policy, and market opportunities.  land-use changes have consequences for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic returns.  land-use patterns shaped by these decisions will serve as input into models that predict the status of species, the flow of ecosystem services, and the value of commodity production from the landscape.  current land-use decisions and the resulting set of consequences will set the stage for future conditions that shape future policies and market opportunities, which, in turn, will affect future land-use changes.  this integrated approach will be used to analyze the likely effect of alternative policies on land-use change dynamics, the consequent trajectory for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic activities on the landscape.  the integrated dynamic landscape modeling approach will be applied to landscapes at several geographic scales, from the 48 contiguous states to regional analysis applied to the willamette basin in oregon and the northern lakes region in wisconsin.  two questions will be addressed by using different scales of analysis within the same modeling approach:  (1) how much difference does inclusion of increased detail and spatial resolution make to the analysis and results?, and (2) can analyses be nested in the sense that one can use the broad-scale analysis to highlight areas and species of concern, at which point more detailed analysis can be undertaken using finer scale analysis?conserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services necessary for human welfare in the long-run in the midst of a growing human economy with pressing current needs requires careful planning based on an understanding of the full set of consequences of human choices and actions.  this project will integrate economic and ecological research into a coherent framework to predict landscape dynamics and the effects of these dynamics on biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and economic production.  the integrated landscape model developed in this project will provide tools and insights that can be used to improve decision making by a broad range of stakeholders.  by facilitating careful thinking about the pattern, extent, and intensity of human activities across the landscape through time, this project may help landowners and policy makers to achieve important species conservation and ecosystem service objectives while also generating high economic returns over the long term.  this project is supported by the nsf dynamics of coupled natural and human systems (cnh) program.',\n",
       " 'abstract: the united states over the past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards across a wide variety of technologies, and a dramatic increase in the volume of patent litigation between rivals. numerous commentators have suggested that the proliferation of these awards, known as  patent thickets , has had socially detrimental consequences since overlapping intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new innovations. patent pools, which can be defined as formal or informal organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties, have been proposed as a way in which firms can address these  patent thicket  problems. patent pools have been most plentiful and well established for decades in the information technology and communications industries. in the past few years, the biomedical research community has expressed increasing interest in patent pools as a potential solution for increasingly prevalent patent licensing issues in biotechnology-related fields. this project builds on the existing work on patent pools, trying to understand how the issues faced in the biomedical industries are similar and different to the issues in information technology and communication. the project combines empirical and theoretical research in this endeavor in an academically rigorous manner. the project is deepening our understanding of a crucial  knowledge-sharing organization , an institution, like a standard-setting organizations or open source project, where firms can strategically share knowledge. broader impacts for scientists and others interested in innovation policy, this project advances understanding of how patent thicket problems can be addressed, and the strategies that are most likely to be effective (as well as more problematic approaches). the project leaders are ensuring that the findings of the study are diffused in a variety of outreach efforts, in order to insure that the ideas can have the most impact. this takes several forms. first, the project leaders are involving practitioners as well as life scientists in the academic conference that is being organized on this topic. as in earlier projects, the project leaders are participating in the public policy process, explaining their findings. finally, the project leaders are disseminating the ideas more broadly through outreach to the popular press.',\n",

       " \"scientists, inventors, writers, and other creators have attested to the importance of inspiration in the creative process. in contrast, creativity researchers have generally dismissed the concept of inspiration, arguing that ascription of creative insight to the intervention of a supernatural source ( muse ) is outmoded myth. however, it is possible to reconcile creators' accounts of inspiration with contemporary science. specifically, consistent with creators' accounts, inspiration is posited to be an effect of creative insight, not its cause; inspiration is posited to be a motivational state that is aroused in response to a creative insight and that compels the individual to translate the creative insight into a creative product. this perspective exposes an important gap in the research literature. creativity researchers have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive, neurological, and contextual origins of creative insight (thus debunking the notion of muse) but have largely ignored the state of inspiration that promotes the translation of creative insights into creative products. this oversight is striking, because the failure to translate creative ideas into tangible products is likely to be among the most important obstacles to innovation. this project involves three primary goals. the first goal is to develop methods for the assessment of inspiration and to provide evidence of their validity. several methods of assessment are being developed, including self-report questionnaires and objective indicators derived, for instance, from digital video of nonverbal behaviors and from electronic monitoring of the creative process. the second goal is to demonstrate that inspiration is a robust predictor of creativity and other socially valued outcomes, including work productivity and efficiency. several types of creative activity are examined, including invention, scientific writing, and the writing of poetry. in each case, creativity is assessed objectively (e.g., receipt of patents) or through a peer-review process. the third goal is to establish the functional significance of inspiration by integrating it with contemporary theories of personality and human motivation. for instance, the personality traits that predict the creativity of an initial insight are expected to be fundamentally different from the traits that predict the tendency to become inspired to actualize the insight. in addition, mysterious aspects of the subjective experience of inspiration, such as the feeling that one is functioning as the mouthpiece of a power beyond oneself, are expected to be explained by the involvement of implicit (unconscious) processes.this project will have important impacts beyond advancing the motivation, inspiration, and creativity research literatures. for instance, the findings will be widely disseminated in the form of research articles, book chapters, and conference presentations; tools for the assessment of inspiration, known to be predictive of creativity, productivity, and efficiency, will be available for use in the workplace and in educational settings; and policy makers and others concerned with societal adaptation to changing physical and sociopolitical environments will be equipped with well-validated models of the processes through which innovative and transformative ideas are translated into concrete products and solutions.\",\n",

       " \"grassland degradation is a global concern, affecting not only wild species and pastoralists who rely on healthy grasslands for their survival, but also non-local people who suffer from resultant hydrological disturbances, dust storms, commodity scarcity, and social consequences of uprooted people.  livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in central asia, and pastures of the tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population.  grasslands on the tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded.  causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife.  prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors.  as a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness.  this interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses.  the investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments.  in addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified.  each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face.  these data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists.  the models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.this project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status.  because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental.  enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide.  in addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials.  direct collaboration with chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers.  direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.   this project is supported by the nsf dynamics of coupled natural and human systems (cnh) program.\",\n",

       " 'designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. to date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. one important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (r&d) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. studies on r&d have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology r&d. this research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to r&d. the representation of technical change and its relation to r&d expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with u.s. patents. the model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. these components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and r&d expenditures under uncertainty. the results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. the new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology r&d by eliminating biases in current models.',\n",

       " \"a tree has been the organizing image to explain the relationships among living creatures since before darwin's explanations for natural descent. the modern practice of comparing dna and protein sequences to discern these relationships, however, has revealed complexities in the process of descent never before imagined. organisms, particularly microbes, evolve by horizontal as well as vertical inheritance of traits with different groups of organisms exchanging genes, in addition to passing them down to the next generation. this research project addresses the question: can the large scale structure of the tree/web of life be discerned? while the current data may be interpreted to mean that the depiction of life's history as a single bifurcating tree is incomplete, this should not be seen as justification to give up on reconstructing life's history. the working hypothesis underlying this research is that a reconstruction of life's early history is indeed possible, provided care is taken to guard against artifacts and that new, informative molecular characters are added to the analyses. four complementary approaches will be used to address the question through analyses of microbial genome sequences. (1) genome sequence data will be examined to find ancient horizontal gene transfer events that created useful taxonomic characters. an automated genome analysis pipeline will be developed to find these events, and these characters will be incorporated into new examinations of evolutionary relationships. (2) complete genome sequences allow comparisons of all the genes of an organism with those of others to measure their evolutionary relatedness. however, the impact of horizontal acquisition of genes on these analyses is unknown. computer simulations and genome sequences from two unrelated groups of microbes that have undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer, the haloarchaea and the thermotogales, will be used to gauge the extent to which different phylogenomic approaches are impacted by highways of gene sharing between different groups of organisms. (3) a public database will be constructed to store information on all putatively identified gene transfer events. this database will be a valuable resource for the wider scientific community to trace the role of gene transfer in the assembly of metabolic pathways and to examine the adaptation of organisms to new ecological niches. (4) the nature of the last common ancestor of all living creatures, the trunk of the tree of life, has been difficult to discern given all the changes in nucleotide composition that have occurred during evolutionary time. a compositional analysis will be used to detect the remaining signal of the genetic code's expansion that occurred early in life's history in order to  root  the tree of life. these in-depth analyses of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes will offer insights into the impacts of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution and phylogenetic reconstructions, as well as identify natural groups in the tree of life and help to resolve its deep structure. unraveling the structure of the tree of life will have percussions in all fields of biology.this research program and its associated education activities will provide an ideal training ground in which high school, undergraduate, and graduate students along with postdoctoral fellows can learn about genome and organismal evolution. plans are for three postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, and about twenty undergraduate and high school students to be trained through computational and laboratory research experiences. the goal is to train computer scientists and biologists to become experts in their respective disciplines and to become effective in trans-disciplinary communication; thereby enabling successful interdisciplinary collaborations. results from the proposed research will be introduced into related courses on three campuses and will be accessible through an integrated database, which also includes a forum for public discussions on topics related to gene transfer and organismal evolution.\",\n",

       " \"understanding how animals perceive and act upon complex natural environments is one of the most pressing challenges in neuroscience, with applications that have potential to revolutionize not only our understanding of the brain, but also machine vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics. until now, studying the neural basis of active vision - how visual stimuli give rise to eye movements under diverse task conditions - has largely been restricted to simplified laboratory stimuli, presented to overtrained animals performing stereotypical tasks. with funding from the national science foundation, the canadian institute of health research, and the national geospatial intelligence agency, dr. douglas munoz at queens university in canada and dr. laurent itti at the university of southern california will combine neurophysiology and computational modeling to investigate free viewing in natural environments. using multi-electrode arrays, this project will record in a deep brain structure, called the superior colliculus (sc). the sc is a layered structure comprising several well-understood neural maps, from purely sensory representations in the superficial layers, to sensorimotor representations linked to the control of eye movements in the deeper layers. the project will start by characterizing responses of neurons in the sc under simple stimulus conditions: when the animal is simply looking at a central fixation cross on a display while small isolated patterns are presented at other visual locations; when the animal searches for an oddball item among an array of distracting items; and when the animal inspects natural images and video clips. the  project will extend the investigators' salience map theories and models, and develop a new model of the sc. the complete model will predict, from any image or video clip, which visual locations are more salient, task-relevant, and candidate targets for eye movements.the project leverages a cross-disciplinary collaboration between a neurophysiology lab (co-pi douglas p. munoz) and a computational modeling lab (pi laurent itti). this will allow, through the combination of experiments and modeling, the interpretation of an otherwise undecipherable mass of data collected during natural viewing. conversely, the theories will guide further experiments. coupling multi-unit recording with modeling during free-viewing of natural videos has never been attempted before, and it is expected that it will lead to new understanding of how percepts map into actions under natural conditions. the project will support undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, who will benefit from exposure to combined physiological and computational techniques, as will the investigators' teaching. in addition to publications, all theory and algorithm source code will be freely distributed, and data will be available through the crcns data sharing web site. this research is hence expected to lead to new and broadly accessible fundamental advances in the understanding of how animals use visual information to guide behavior, and how one could build machines which act in similar ways when faced with the complex natural world.\",\n",

       " \"people's perceptual judgments and actions depend on the pick-up of informative energy patterns arriving at the senses. as examples, a driver's detection of certain optical variables informs the decision of whether it is safe to pass another car; another variable might inform the driver whether the current braking action will stop the car in time, or if force on the brake needs to be increased. one key function of perceptual and perceptual-motor learning is to change the variables that the perceiver-actor attends to in making their judgments or in controlling their actions. perceiver-actors educate their attention to variables that permit more accurate judgments and more effective motor activities. a central question, however, is how perceivers improve. while experience can make clear that judgments and actions are not accurate and that change is needed, until recently it has been unclear how (or if) experience actually directs the improvement. a new theory, called direct learning, lays out how change is guided by information. the current project explores: how should one arrange a perceptual learning situation so that learning proceeds as quickly and accurately as possible? can perceptual learning be shown to be indifferent to the probabilistic value of sensory information? does learning to detect some information entail exploratory movements that create it? if so, can goal-directed movement also be aimed at information-production? the findings could have broad practical applications to attempts to train perceiver-actors to discriminate objects (letters, faces, aircraft), events (deceptive intention, impending collisions), and to control movements (aircraft landing, skilled athletic or dance performance).\",\n",

       " 'health care delivery in the u.s. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the u.s. over the next decade.  one proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (hit).  these hit systems, particularly electronic health records (ehr) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  yet simply installing hit without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. what is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how hit and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. this project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the u.s., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of hit and process design techniques.  the questions we address are: what capabilities does an ehr provide and which are used by health care organizations?  which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what ehr systems provide?  what are the dynamics of change by which ehr capabilities affect care delivery processes?  how and why do new ehr systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  how do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new ehr systems?  answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the u.s.this team will conduct multiple case studies of ehr implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the ehr implementation alters health care delivery processes.  the case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, fallon clinic, umass memorial health care, canada?s single payer system in british columbia, and two of israel?s four health fund systems.  these four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  improving the quality of health care delivered in the u.s. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  the health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  simplistic solutions, however, will not work. solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  the work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming hit and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems.',\n",

       " \"many neurons in the auditory system respond to sounds nonlinearly; that is, its response to two sounds played simultaneously differs from the sum of its responses to each sound played alone. nonlinearities are necessary for many computational functions, but unlike nonlinear models that allow closed-form solutions, nonlinear models are often too hard to characterize in practice. to make nonlinear models tractable, this project will combine single-unit recording in awake marmoset monkey with automated online stimulus design by parallel computing. the goal of this stimulus design is not to maximize the firing rate of a neuron, but to extract the most information about the global stimulus-response relationship.  optimal sounds will be designed  on the fly  according to a neuron's response history, with the help of a fast parallel computer whose running time is compatible with the single-unit recording experiment. the proposed research is expected to produce practical and widely applicable methods for characterizing nonlinear sensory neurons. the auditory system is an ideal system for this type of online experiment because sound space is of lower dimensions and allows faster computations. the methods developed here are expected to generalize to nonlinear problems in other sensory modalities.theory and algorithm development will focus on generating sound stimuli which can either most accurately estimate a given model, or maximally distinguish competing models. nonlinear models with various degrees of complexity, including neural network models, will be used simultaneously, and contrasted against one another in the automated experiment. the model-based sound design method will be used to characterize complex response properties of neurons in auditory cortex and inferior colliculus of awake marmoset monkey, a vocal primate. this project focuses on the auditory cortex because studies of its pronounced nonlinearities may potentially benefit most from the new method. for comparison the same method will also be applied to the inferior colliculus, the inputs to which are better known, allowing more realistic hierarchical models to be developed. the models obtained from this method should provide a concise summary of the global stimulus-response relationship of a neuron that generalizes across all types of stimuli. neural network models may also help extract additional information about the connectivity between different neuronal types, thus providing a link between the stimulus-response function and the structure of the underlying neural circuits.\",\n",
       " \"innovation is becoming more open, often involving multiple organizations in a division of innovative labor (doil).  the division of innovative labor in the economy is conceived of as the distribution across firms and other organizations of the following steps in the innovation process: 1) research/idea generation; 2) development; and 3) commercialization.  despite its importance, there is little broad-based, systematic evidence on the extent or nature of the doil, nor on its impact on firm performance or the rate of technical advance.  the project collects the first systematic data on the doil for the united states by surveying over 20,000 firms in manufacturing and selected service industries,.   the collected data quantifies key features of the doil.  it also provides the basis for developing and empirically testing models of the doil and its effects on innovative performance.  the project addresses a number of important questions, such as the extent to which startups, as compared to established firms, are generators of new ideas, the importance of universities as sources of industrial innovation, and the extent to which firms' use of external knowledge inputs increases their innovative performance. finally, the research advances the economics of innovation by generating formal models that capture the doil and testing those models empirically.broader impacts: this project is the first national effort to collect data on innovative activity generally, going beyond r&d and patenting. it is an important addition to the data infrastructure required for a science of science and innovation policy.  by generating new data on innovative activity, creating new metrics, and developing new models of the innovation process, the research also informs both public policy and firm strategy.  the research should contribute to deliberations on intellectual property policy and policies on standards and cooperative research and development agreements that potentially affect the growth of technology markets and the doil.  by highlighting the role of small firms, startups, and universities in the innovation process, the findings should also help inform federal support to university research and new firm formation.  the project findings should also contribute to the federal government's ongoing efforts to improve its collection of data on industrial r&d and innovation.  the research also contributes to the management of innovation by highlighting the returns to extramural knowledge sourcing, or strategic alliances formed to develop or commercialize new technologies.\",\n",
       " \"on an ordinary day, people perform actions that affect other people's behavior resulting in outcomes that affect both.  such social interactions are dynamic, far ranging, and usually require an exchange of information between the parties involved. a simple example is two persons modifying their approach to an elevator to accommodate each other's passage through the narrow space. more complex situations involve a teacher providing guidance to a pupil based on the pupil's own actions or training foreign military personnel to accomplish some function that depends on the latter's previous experiences. how are such social interactions to be quantified and understood? what goes on in a person's brain when they interact with another and what principles and mechanisms govern the coordination between brains?  the investigators of this project constitute an interdisciplinary team whose expertise spans physics, cognitive science and neuroscience. they use the concepts, methods and tools of coordination dynamics, the science of coordination, to investigate both the behavioral and neural underpinnings of social behavioral interactions. the basic experimental paradigm involves coordination of movements between two people or between an individual and a computer avatar endowed with human-like capabilities. pairs of people perform simple actions in front of each other and the investigators monitor key behavioral and neural variables that reveal how strongly each affects the other. by testing specific predictions of a mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, the investigators aim to understand how social coordination evolves in time and to determine the respective strength of one person's influence on another. modern technology is always seeking to enhance human experience and productivity. the notion of 'others' has been expanded to include not only real human beings but also cyber-individuals, as evident in the increasing roles played by robotics and virtual environments in everyday human transactions.  in crucial experiments, a human subject interacts with a virtual partner, an avatar driven by the investigators' mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, thereby allowing the investigators to manipulate parameters (the 'personality' or 'attitude' of the virtual partner) that are not normally accessible in studies of live interactions. thus the present project may not only uncover rules of ordinary social coordination but also offer a principled approach to human-machine interaction. in addition, the project will disseminate knowledge about complex systems and dynamical approaches to human social behavior. the investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced methods and analysis techniques that cut across the behavioral and social sciences, the physics and mathematics of coupled dynamical systems, and neuroscience and brain imaging. the development of new measuring instruments that may apply to any arbitrary social interaction is a target. such training aims to bring forth a new generation of interdisciplinary scientist who will be equipped to integrate studies of brain, behavior and social function within a much needed dynamical framework.\",\n",
       " \"this project will address the development of catalysts for the stereoselective formation of c-c bonds using nitroalkanes.  the ease of deprotonation adjacent to nitroalkanes along with their facile conversion to other functionality such as amines and ketones makes them attractive targets for reaction control.  organocatalysts have been developed that achieve asymmetric conjugate addition of nitroalkanes with a variety of substrates, presumably through non-covalent stabilization of the anionic intermediates.  catalyst design continues through investigation of additional scaffolds that are complementary to nitroalkane structure as well as expanding the scope of applicable nitroalkanes. with this award, the organic and macromolecular chemistry program is supporting the research of professor linton of the department of chemistry at bowdoin college.  professor linton's research efforts revolve around the development of molecular catalysts that control the reactions of nitroalkanes.  since stereoselective syntheses are required for numerous pharmaceutical and biological substrates, these catalysts have broad applicability to a wide variety of relevant target molecules.  additionally this approach uses environmentally friendly organocatalysts that can perform these reactions with minimal use of reagents and minimal production of waste.\",\n",

why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? the research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. the research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.the effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.nontechnical summary:this award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. the broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. this research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.the search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the pi in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' this work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.the  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. the questions are quite basic.  what is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low?

       " 'cbet-0828655barthelmieoptimal spacing of wind turbines in large wind farm arrays depends in part on turbine interactions, i.e. wind turbine wakes that are maximized at close spacing. wakes are the volume downwind of individual turbines where wind speed is reduced and turbulence is enhanced due to energy extraction at the preceding turbine. in large offshore wind farms, power losses due to wakes can exceed 20% of total potential power production and lead to an increase in fatigue loading reducing turbine lifetimes. the objective of the research is to quantify and improve predictive capability for the development, propagation, combination and dissipation of wind turbine wakes in large onshore wind farms.  wake models used in current wind farm prediction tools under-predict power losses in large wind farms. there are two potential explanations; (1) large wind farms create additional turbulence which fundamentally alters the structure of the overlying boundary-layer, (2) combining wakes from individual turbines both downwind and laterally is mis-specified by the current generation of wind farm models. evaluation of the models in small wind farms (three rows or smaller) indicates that models are able to capture power losses due to wakes which lends support to these two hypotheses that pertain to large multi-row arrays. this project will combine statistical analysis of observed wind farm data with evaluation and development of three classes of models (from the analytic to computational fluid dynamics codes) to improve predictions of wake losses. the goal is to produce a model that accurately captures wake propagation and interactions in different wind speed, turbulence and atmospheric stability conditions, to model wake combination in a more realistic way and to account for changes in the structure of the boundary-layer. ultimately, this will produce a model which accurately quantifies wake losses for existing wind farm layouts and will allow assessment of wind farm layouts (turbine spacing) which are optimized for wake losses.  the outcome from this project will contribute unique insight into how wakes propagate through large wind farms, and transform the ways in which wake impacts on power output are modeled.this project will be led by professor r.j. barthelmie, a renowned leader in wind energy research, and will be conducted in collaboration with scientists at the national renewable energy laboratory and airtricity/e.on, a world leading renewable energy company. both have agreed to provide data from operating large wind farms and to collaboration on model application and evaluation. this collaboration will both enhance the project and increase symbioses and knowledge transfer. the project will also enhance educational and training opportunities at indiana university.',\n",

       " 'evaporation from the soil largely determines both water availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and the partitioning of solar radiation between sensible and latent heat. it is key to both hydrology and climate. the evaporation process is complex, involving movement and phase change of water, varying with depth and time. following water inputs, evaporation occurs at the soil surface, controlled by atmospheric demand. as surface soil water is depleted, evaporation becomes soil-limited and shifts below the surface; nonetheless it is generally viewed as a strictly surface process. as a result, measurement methods and understanding of these near-surface phenomena have lagged behind demand for accurate data. much current research emphasizes large-scale areal estimates of soil moisture and temperature, but poor understanding of the soil water evaporation process causes low accuracy in water and energy balances. this poor understanding is largely due to our current inability to make the needed measurements.the purpose of the proposed research is to develop and test a new approach to measure evaporation within the soil. recently developed sensors and concepts enable us to quantify sensible heat transferred into and out of mm-scale near-surface soil layers, as well as the change in sensible heat stored within each layer. combined with conservation of energy, these measurements can locally quantify subsurface evaporation, showing the temporal patterns of in situ evaporation. research will test four hypotheses: (1) that a sensible heat balance method can accurately estimate the mass of water evaporated from subsurface soil layers, (2) that the heat balance method can be extended to determine the latent heat flux from the soil surface layer (0-3 mm), (3) that through combined heat and mass balance, estimates of other hydrological components (transpiration and soil water flow) will be quantified or constrained, and (4) that the sensible heat balance method can quantitatively partition et into evaporation and transpiration. hypotheses 1-3 will be tested with both laboratory and field experiments, and hypothesis 4 only by field experiments. laboratory experiments will measure soil thermal properties, water content, and water flux under a combination of 2 energy regimes, 3 surface conditions, and 3 soils. calculated evaporative loss via heat balance will be compared to evaporation measured by mass balance. in the field experiments, independent measurements of evaporation and transpiration will allow rigorous testing of heat balance estimates of transpiration and soil water evaporation.the intellectual merit of the proposed work is a new measurement-based methodology for quantifying soil water evaporation. the proposed research addresses current knowledge gaps by developing and testing in situ soil water evaporation measurement with novel sensors and analysis. information obtained in the study will elucidate important evaporative processes. the research will quantify observation of soil water evaporation at and below the soil surface. this represents a notable advancement over descriptions of evaporation as a surface-only process.the proposed work carries broader impact by providing educational, scientific, and societal opportunities. fundamental experience is provided for an early-career scientist, graduate students (including a minority student who is a nsf agep fellow), and undergraduates. results will be widely disseminated to the scientific community via website and published articles, and measurement techniques will have immediate repercussions for weather, climate, and environmental monitoring. achieving the project goals will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental critical-zone properties and processes, enable better environmental monitoring and management, and enhance our predictions of large-scale hydrological and climate dynamics.',\n",
       " 'ses-0817659rachel l. einwohnerpurdue universitythis study asks: why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? what conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? while current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  this research will study jewish victims of the holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. yet well known cases of jewish resistance such as the warsaw ghetto uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, jews did rise up against their oppressors. jewish ghettos in nazi-occupied europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. this project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. the investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the warsaw ghetto (where collective jewish resistance occurred), the vilna ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the lodz ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (n=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). these testimonies are housed at the university of southern california shoah foundation institute. oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package nvivo.the study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. first, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., holocaust education in public schools). in addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of jewish passivity. lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots.',\n",

       " 'in most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. the scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. this project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. this work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. it is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. from a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  in practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. in carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. in addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. the pis plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as matlab, r or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``statistical analysis of online data  at berkeley and princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program.',\n",

       " 'tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to holocene and younger deposits. although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. the largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms.carbonate strata within the proterozoic atar group, mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. the wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the west african craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. this project, a collaboration between the university of tennessee knoxville and ohio university, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact.this project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. both investigators have a long history of public outreach. the university of tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. these exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers inimplementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern tennessee.',\n",
       " \"enhanced science of science and innovation policy depends on better metrics. you can't manage what you can't measure.  this is particularly true for interdisciplinary research, which currently has few generally agreed-upon measures with acceptable degrees of accuracy.  researchers at the university of sussex have begun to address this problem by developing a conceptual framework to gauge research diversity.  the current project builds upon that conceptual framework to empirically test metrics that gauge the interdisciplinarity of particular bodies of research.  one proposed key measure assesses the degree to which particular research papers, or collections of such, integrate research knowledge from diverse research domains.  a second measure determines the degree of specialization of collections of research papers (e.g., those published by a particular research center or those of a research area such as quantum dots).  the resulting measures help track and characterize the emergence of new (interdisciplinary) research areas.  the project described in this proposal seeks to generate analytical algorithms for indicators of interdisciplinarity.  it also seeks to visually depict knowledge interchanges among areas of research activity.  such science maps can help identify and characterize focused areas of research--domains--that are sources of knowledge used by other domains.  they can also show the extent of intellectual and social networking among both domains and contributing institutions.  this project will, through us-uk collaboration, develop effective means to apply and test these new metrics.  the proposed project focuses on nanoscience and nanoengineering ( nano ), an emergent research domain of considerable significance that extends well beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.  georgia tech has assembled a substantial nano dataset that will serve as the main testbed for computing and assessing indicator variations.  the research team will generate indicator sets and maps of selected nano sub-topics (e.g., molecular motors research).  these indicator sets and maps will be shared with researchers and r&d managers to gauge their validity and utility. taking into account feedback, the research team will then develop a taxonomy of nanotechnology research activity based on identification of coherent research sub-areas.broader impacts: these tools better enable scientists, science managers, and federal science and regulatory agencies to gauge and track cross-domain knowledge transfers.  failure to recognize the full extent and complexity of these patterns could result in major funding and regulatory mistakes.   the new indicators and accompanying maps help identify leverage points likely to spark advances in science, technology, and innovation.  they can also facilitate graduate education by identifying convergent knowledge domains - potentially emerging  interdisciplines.   better understanding of research landscapes can help orient graduate curricula and spotlight promising dissertation topics.  more accurate interdisciplinarity measures also contribute to an ongoing national academies initiative to bolster interdisciplinary research across the us.\",\n",

       " 'channel bifurcations, wherein one channel splits into two, are the building blocks of braided, anastomosed, and distributary channel networks. recent work has shown that the most common flow partitioning at bifurcations is asymmetric, and that this asymmetry seems to promote stability. why and under what hydrographic and sedimentologic conditions this should be so, remain a puzzle. here we propose an integrated field and theoretical investigation of the morphology, flow, and sedimentary processes of higher shear-stress, natural river bifurcations, with the objective of understanding and predicting their dynamical behavior. the field studies will be conducted to encompass two bifurcating systems with different sedimentation characteristics: i) distributary channel bifurcations of the mossy delta of the saskatchewan river, where we have conducted pilot studies concerning bifurcation morphodynamics, and ii) bifurcations within the wax lake delta system, louisiana, where active sedimentation is leading to rapid distributary channel growth. several bifurcations at each site will be chosen to span a range of morphologic types. bed morphology, water surface topography, flow velocity, and sediment transport rate will be measured at each bifurcation on a closely spaced grid at several flow stages. the field data will provide boundary and initial conditions for numerical experiments designed to define the processes and morphological conditions that lead to inherently unstable bifurcations, and detail the controlling boundary conditions for stability. earlier numerical models will be improved by using delft3d-flow, a morphodynamic model that accounts for: (1) three-dimensional turbulent unsteady, nonuniform flow, (2) interaction between bed topography, flow, and both bedload and suspended load, and (3) morphodynamically interacting erodible banks and bed. numerical experiments will allow us to determine the feedback processes that promote stable bifurcations and predict which channel configurations are stable in the face of perturbations. we aim to yield a stability diagram for channel bifurcations and assess the influence of barform dynamics and downstream channel change in influencing bifurcation stability. a better understanding and predictive capability of channel bifurcation behavior would improve flood forecasting, planning and development of floodplain and channel structures, channel designs, and the success of stream restoration efforts. the results of this study also will advance our knowledge of when and where river avulsions will take. insofar as it is transformative, it will resolve the differences among competing stability theories, and produce a model, constrained by the best-available field data, which can be used to predict the stability and behavior of these ubiquitous hydrologic and geomorphic nodes.resulting from this study: this work constitutes the dissertation topic and financial support for one ph. d. candidate and will support one post-doctoral researcher. two native american high school students from the cumberland house cree nation, saskatchewan will be trained in its scientific methods. all students will benefit from exposure to a problem requiring the integration of geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamic modeling.',\n",

       " 'the research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. one aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. this especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). the main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. the solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the moving balloon algebra (mba) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the network algebra (netalg) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the moving object in network (monet) algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. the resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few. the educational component of this project includes specialized classes that focus on important aspects of this project, the creation and use of new gis educational materials, and the involvement of students in interdisciplinary research. the project website (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mschneid/research/fundedresearchprojects/nsf-iis-0812194/)is used for the dissemination of research results, educational material, publications, generated data sets, produced software, and other information of interest.',\n",

       " \"it is important to understand how people in our society, including our leaders and people in mission-critical positions, make decisions in various stressful contexts.  a major area of research in cognitive psychology describes how people make decisions as a process of information accumulation over time.  these theories state that people make better (more accurate) choices if they have enough time to accumulate relevant evidence. a strength of the information accumulation theories is that they explain why speedy responding, perhaps under stress, is often erroneous responding.  much experimental evidence supports the information accumulation theories.   however, this evidence comes from experimental tasks embedded within a larger experimental context, a context that includes temporal constraints such as when the different components of the task are presented and when decisions are required.  that is, psychology experiments (and many real-world decision problems) have a rhythm within which decision problems are framed and solved, and this rhythm also exerts an influence on decision performance.  the importance of task rhythm is underscored by another theoretical perspective which emphasizes the dynamic aspects of the choice environment.  in this perspective, attention is viewed as a dynamic process attuned to the underlying task rhythm, and understanding how the pace of the environment interacts with how effectively people focus attention is critical for understanding the decision-making process.  this proposal offers an integrated theory  that formally combines the information accumulation and dynamic attending approaches.  the proposed experiments test predictions of the hybrid model with regard to effects of task difficulty, pacing and rhythm, and the role of instructions and feedback.  this research is significant because it links choice behaviors to contextual factors that shape people's attention, thus allowing them to  tune in  to relevant information more or less effectively.  it will improve our understanding of choice performance of healthy individuals who must render sometimes critical decisions under time stress, and also, eventually, choice performance of individuals who suffer from a variety of attentional dysfunctions (e.g., attention deficit disorders, autism, etc.).\",\n",
       " 'vision is the dominant sensory modality that people use to interact with the external environment and to learn about it. there is behavioral evidence that even relatively short periods of training with action video games can improve performance on some kinds of visual abilities, especially those that allow people to analyze spatial relationships among objects in the environment. for example, after action video game training, people are able to keep track of more objects moving around in the visual world than they could before. this exploratory research addresses three gaps in current understanding. first, the full range of visual abilities that can be improved by action video game training remains unknown. second, it is not known whether such training could improve learning speed itself during visual tasks, such as those that involve predicting sequences of spatial locations. third, little is known about the brain changes that enable such improvements. the proposed research will measure performance and brain activation in a group of participants (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) on a battery of visual tasks before and after a two-week action video game training period. the pattern of performance and brain activation changes will reveal the specific visual and learning abilities and brain networks that are modified by video game training.the proposed study will provide preliminary data potentially leading to training-based applications that are important for society. specifically, the visuospatial abilities that can be improved after action video game practice are used in a broad range of professions. for instance, mathematicians, engineers, architects and many other individuals routinely engaged in tasks that require performing complex mental spatial transformations may benefit from action video game training. this research may be eventually lead to developing effective training video games that maximally take advantage of adult brain plasticity. information about the precise neural bases of these processes may also lead to innovative educational practices that enhance learning abilities themselves, help people with visuospatial learning disabilities, as in attention deficit disorder, or even to future pharmacological methods to improve performance.',\n",
       " \"the period between the late-pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. the creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.the yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western u.s., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. this examination of the late-glacial and early-holocene periods in the yellowstone region poses the following questions: what are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? the study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.  yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western us is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.intellectual merit of the research: understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and us climate change assessments. the proposed study builds on existing knowledge of yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. this project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. the resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.broader impacts of the research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. this project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the national park service on yellowstone's history; education and training activities for park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of yellowstone findings in park-directed k-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on yellowstone. the project also continues the pis' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public.\",\n",

       " 'despite evidence that innovation has become increasingly collaborative, our understanding of collaborative creativity and its impact on economic productivity remains incomplete.  for example, how should firms structure the collaborations of their inventors, given that networks which enhance the generation of a new idea also appear to hamper the dissemination of that idea?  how does knowledge flow within and between regions and how can policy makers influence those flows for maximal social welfare?  how does investment in scientific research result in peer-reviewed publication, the diffusion of knowledge, invention, and patenting, and ultimate gains in economic productivity?  these questions remain unanswered because social network data are difficult to gather, particularly across time, space, and boundaries.  this proposal allows answering these questions by calculating and posting millions of relational data, based on all co-authorship ties between inventors of u.s. patents, from 1963 through the present.the database complements the national bureau of economic research (nber) patent database by providing the social networks of patent co-authorships.  it creates a standard social network patent database at the individual inventor and aggregate levels including organizational, regional, and technological.  it reduces barriers to entry to scholars who lack the requisite programming skills and hardware to create the data on their own and enables real time graphing of patent co-authorship networks.  it provides a website by which actual inventors can assess the accuracy of the algorithms used to uniquely identify them in the patent database.  finally, the project provides data on a public website accessible by scholars, business analysts, and students.  just as the original nber database has unleashed broad and diverse scholarship on innovation (over 500 papers cite it, according to google scholar, by early 2008), the social network database project will unleash a similar wave of research, focused on collaborative creativity and the social networks of inventors and their organizations.broader impacts: the research will publish social network data from all u.s. patent co-authorships (1963-present) for use by researchers, students, and business analysts.  it will provide real-time ability to visually illustrate these networks, with a variety of variables illustrated by color and size of the nodes and co-authorship links.  it will enable answering how managers should structure collaborative relationships and how information flows across organizational, regional, and technological boundaries.  it will enable tracing the career productivity and mobility of millions of inventors around the world.  in conjunction with other databases on research grants and scientific publication, it will illuminate the process of knowledge creation and dissemination at many levels of analysis, from the individual, to the organizational, and international.the primary purpose of this project is to make social network data, based on the co-authorship of u.s. patents from 1963 through the present, available to researchers and the public at large.  the plan, within six months of project start, is to make the data available from the harvard mit data center.  the data will also be archived in the henry a. murray research archive.  raw data and the source code will be included in these postings.',\n",

       " 'decomposition, the breakdown of dead plant and animal material, is a fundamental process that affects soil fertility and ecosystem carbon storage. most of what is known about decomposition is from studies in high rainfall areas, but this knowledge does not translate well to dryland ecosystems. some recent studies suggest solar ultra-violet radiation has a major influence on decomposition in drylands; however, other studies indicate the level of mixing of wind/water-transported soils with litter is the key factor. this project seeks to resolve these competing explanations through a series of laboratory studies and field experiments in arizona designed to measure interactions among these factors. these linkages will be assessed in the context of woody plant encroachment into grasslands, a globally extensive vegetation change in drylands. this investigation will yield new insights into processes that affect soil fertility and carbon storage in drylands by combining the disciplines of plant community ecology, ecosystem science and earth science in a novel framework. the findings will be relevant nationally and internationally, as dryland ecosystems characterize major portions of the us and global land area, and may be significant carbon sinks. in addition to dissemination in the scientific community, results will be communicated to land management personnel and organizations through outreach programs. the study will provide training opportunities for four graduate and numerous undergraduate students. the collaborating institutions (university of arizona, new mexico state university, university of kentucky and loyola university) have substantial minority enrollments, and efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups.',\n",

       " 'it is often difficult to distinguish whether the graduates of a challenging academic program are successful because of their educational experiences, or whether the program simply selected individuals destined for success into the program.  it is usually impossible to conduct a true experiment with random assignment of students to educational opportunities.  however, large-scale shifts in policy can serve as  natural experiments  that change the way students are matched to educational programs and allow us to identify causal consequences of education.the specific research question addressed by this project is:  do institution-level shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred lead to measurable changes in graduate outcomes?for example: higher earnings, increased participation in the science and engineering workforce, or a larger probability of filing patents?relative to similar earlier graduates? and how does the research inform the science of science policy?writing in 1994, william trent and john hill described a concerted effort by a group of historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) to expand educational opportunities in engineering, computer science and other technical fields,  to prepare their students for expanded career choices.   preliminary evidence suggests that a shift in the relative participation of black college graduates in occupations related to engineering, math, computer science, or physical sciences (ems) occurred at about the same time.  furthermore, growth in ems college majors was particularly strong among students most likely to attend hbcus:  those who attended high school in the south.  the initial phase of this project is designed to distinguish whether the growth was driven by hbcu policies, or by change at other southern institutions.  the second phase involves assembling more than 30 years of data on the number and type of degrees conferred by each u.s. institution of higher education (collected annually by the u.s. department of education), analyzing the data to find other examples of large institution-level (or state-level) shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred, and combining this information with data from other sources to discover the resulting educational and economic impacts.the initial phase of this research is designed to reveal the institution-level processes underlying recent expansion of science and engineering participation by a persistently underrepresented minority group.  more generally, the research project expands knowledge about the extent to which exposure to science or engineering education at the undergraduate level changes the set of skills college graduates bring to the labor market, and whether that change is substantial enough to affect a whole host of outcome measures including earnings, occupation, and patent activity. broader impactsthe knowledge gained from this research project informs individual-level career-path choices as well as educational and workforce policies.  educational materials appropriate for middle school or high school students are intended teach fundamental mathematics concepts while they convey motivating information-- derived from this research-- about the economic value of pursuing academically challenging educational programs.',\n",

       " 'trace metal sample handling and analysis have led to the discovery that tiny (nanomolar) levels of metals such as iron are having profound influences on the diversity, abundance, and carbon fixation of primary producers in the oceans. one of these important primary producers, marine cyanobacteria, have similarly been shown to be affected, positively and negatively, by copper (natural and anthropogenic) levels and may also be influenced by cobalt and nickel levels. at the same time, cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton are changing the distributions of metals and their reactivity through uptake, which causes measurable depletion of metals in surface waters, and through the extra-cellular production of metal binding ligands. because of the importance of copper in aquatic environments, the pis will characterize copper metabolism in marine cyanobacteria using model synechococcus strains from oligotrophic environments and from coastal environments that have very different metal physiologies revealed by the whole genome sequencing projects. they will characterize how the strains respond to different copper levels using whole genome microarrays that probe the global response of the cell and will combine these studies with state of the art characterization of intracellular metal levels and other measures of cellular physiology and photosynthetic capacity. molecular genetics studies of diverse copper associated genes will be undertaken to determine their function in the cell. preliminary results have found a potential candidate for an intracellular copper binding protein that is conserved in all marine cyanobacteria. at the same time, preliminary results have found that coastal cyanobacteria have greater resistance to copper than open ocean species and this might be due to a novel copper binding or efflux system. the pis will illustrate the importance of copper in aquatic environments by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. this will be undertaken in collaboration with aquatic adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science.broader impacts this research will reveal some of the major mechanisms by which marine cyanobacteria have adapted to metal levels in coastal and oligotrophic environments. thus these results will help us understand the distribution and diversity of these organisms in relation to global primary productivity. they should lead to more robust biomarkers for metal stress and pollution in coastal environments. the pis will expand on a previous outreach activity like their museum exhibit on marine genomics at the birch aquarium, la jolla ca, by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. this will be undertaken in collaboration with aquatic adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science, inspire environmental action, and increase exposure to marine habitats. in addition an undergraduate and graduate student in the interdisciplinary field of the metal physiology of microbes will be trained.',\n",

       " \"the period between the late-pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. the creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.the yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western u.s., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. this examination of the late-glacial and early-holocene periods in the yellowstone region poses the following questions: what are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? the study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western us is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.intellectual merit of the research: understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and us climate change assessments. the proposed study builds on existing knowledge of yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. this project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. the resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.broader impacts of the research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. this project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the national park service on yellowstone's history; education and training activities for park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of yellowstone findings in park-directed k-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on yellowstone. the project also continues the pis' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public.\",\n",
       " \"ses 0601801vilna bashirutgers universityover the last 10 years, the number of adoptions of foreign-born children completed by american parents has increased tenfold over a wide number of countries, to the point where such adoptions number over 20,000 foreign-born children each year. prospective parents tend to be racially white, professional class, and wealthier than average. this project is designed to answer two research questions regarding this surging phenomenon. the first is: how do agents adopting american parents and international adoption agencies make decisions about how they racially identify foreign born adopted children and racially represent the nations from which the children come? the answer is not predictable from the large and growing literature on what has been variously called racial formation, racialization, and ethnoracial assignment. these writings reinforce the idea that race is a system constructed on a premise that some people are more deserving of privilege and preference than others, but they also suggest that racial advantage and disadvantage is not doled out in a manner fixed for all time. racial privilege, instead, evolves with changing political and economic circumstances. much of this work is historically based, using legal and historical analysis to re-tell the story of this historical change over time. the project differs in that it attempts to capture a contemporary and ongoing racialization process. a second question asks: what is the relationship between gender and race in the international adoption process? this search for the foreign-born can be said to be racially motivated, as scholars have suggested that american race and class dynamics have created a  shortage  of desirable this  project studies a more contemporary manifestation of the racial assignment process by looking at the ways agents involved in placing foreign-born children in american homes construct those children's races, and help to set their racial identities, and to examine the relationship between gender and race in these processes. the principal investigator will use qualitative research methods to study the racial assigning processes in  three sites in which they occur. the first site focuses on adoption agencies' representations, via a content analysis of the print materials they provide to prospective parents, and through their websites. a second site of research examines the growing cultural dialog on international adoption as expressed in advice books on  how to  undertake an intercountry adoption, raise a child different from oneself, and ensure your child learns his/her  culture.  there is also a nascent but expanding children's literature on international adoption meant to comfort children who are foreign-born and/or explain the adoption to them as they grow. the pi will use content analysis in order to examine how print and visual media and other sites for advice in international adoptive childrearing (e.g. cultural camps) contribute to or hope to influence the racialization of these children. finally, the pi will interview parents who have adopted foreign-born children  to understand parents' thoughts and processes about the (inter-) racial aspects of international adoption, and learn about their  practices in raising their foreign-born child. the broader impacts of this work include training undergraduate and graduate students.  results will be disseminated widely and the data will be made available to other researchers interested in replication and reanalysis. this data availability contributes to strengthening qualitative research methods.\",\n",

       " \"an extraordinary explosion of new information on the human genome is becoming available from scientific research. one of the many facets of this enterprise is the characterization of the variation in gene frequencies that exists among human populations. gene frequency variation among the world's populations has arisen from the net effect of all the genetically relevant chance and systematic events in the history of those populations past and present population sizes, the relative degree of endogamous and exogamous mating practices and how they varied over time, natural selection dynamics as the disease environment and climate changed, and the numerous subdivisions and mergers of ancient populations as humans spread around the world. the knowledge scientists are accumulating of the extant patterns of genetic similarity among human populations provides useful information to the many different areas where researchers are working to understand the roles those diverse factors have played in human evolution. this includes human relationships with other species from microbes to the other great apes as well as the more recent relationships among the human populations of the world as reflected in written histories. the allele frequency database (alfred), created at yale university in 2000 with support from nsf, makes data on human genetic variation broadly available for research and education. this award will support 3 specific aims supporting the overall goal of integrating into alfred the data just now becoming available from various research teams studying enormous numbers of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) on a few to as many as several dozen populations from around the world. the number of snps studied in these 'very high throughput' or vht projects ranges from several hundred thousand to about 2 million snps distributed across the human chromosomes. the first specific aim focuses on greatly expanding the contents of alfred by automating the curation process sufficiently to facilitate the addition of these very large data sets. other data from the scientific literature will continue to be incorporated with priority given to snp results from populations not already represented in the database. the second aim of this project enhances the educational and research value of alfred by improving the geographic information system (gis) interface, especially by allowing greater flexibility in the graphical display of data. the third aim is to enhance the user-friendly interface generally in order to help users access the vastly expanded contents. new and more flexible methods will be created to facilitate assembling and downloading useful subsets of the huge multi-population and multi-marker datasets. these improvements will also include expanding the explanatory text and static graphics for educating the users about the use of the database as well as background information on the nature of the information contained in the database. currently, alfred is a fairly large database with almost 280,000 gene frequency tables based on more than 650 human populations studied very unevenly on more than 14,700 polymorphisms along with detailed population and marker descriptions and links to other informative databases. the addition of the data from the vht projects will vastly increase the scale of the database on the polymorphism dimension requiring a variety of adjustments to help users as outlined in specific aims 2 and 3 in order to take advantage of the wealth of new information. these improvements and expansions to alfred will magnify the value of this resource for research and education in anthropological genetics and many other interdisciplinary sciences (such as archaeology, demography, linguistics, forensics, ethnography, and medical research) that already make use of the database. alfred thus will be strengthened in the service of a variety of functions for education and for interdisciplinary research. the enhanced gis interface will help summarize information for various emerging new disciplines such as geographical genetics and existing disciplines such as genetic epidemiology. alfred will be able to provide even more reference gene frequencies for comparison with new data sets that researchers develop. the database can also assist in the planning of future studies by helping researchers focus on combinations of genetic markers and population samples that can test various research questions or to identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled in by collecting new datasets. in the broadest sense, the expansion of alfred supports a wide array of disciplines and educational efforts aimed at providing a better understanding of our biological history as a species. additionally, one of the most effective means to combat the misuse of genetic information is to make data regarding genetic variation in our species widely available through facilities like alfred.\",\n",
       " \"project summarythe stable isotope chemistry of water is a powerful tool for probing the atmospheric water cycle and has been used to advance our understanding of water vapor dynamics around the globe. until recently, measuring water vapor isotope ratios was a time-consuming and laborious process, but advances in spectroscopic techniques now allow automated, real-time, nearly continuous measurements of the 18o/16o and 2h/1h (or d/h) ratios in water vapor. in addition, advances in remote sensing of earth's infrared emission spectrum at high resolution now allow the atmospheric deuterium abundance to be mapped globally. these new technologies are very promising for climate studies, but we do not fully understand the biases in these new measurements, nor do we know how measurements made with these new technologies compare with one another and with the more traditional and labor-intensive mass spectrometric techniques involving vacuum flask collection and cryogenic trapping. before the full potential of the new spectroscopic methods for water vapor isotope measurements can be realized in climate research, a program of instrument validation and intercomparison must be performed. the pis will make measurements of water vapor isotopologues at the noaa observatory at mauna loa, hawaii using three different laser-based sensors and two different satellites, which will be validated against traditional mass spectrometry techniques applied to samples collected on site. the goal of this study is to compare the different measurement techniques in order to assess of the fidelity of these new measurement technologies and to provide new data on the processes that control the humidity of the subtropical pacific. this comprehensive set of measurements will be made from october 12-24, 2008, in conjunction with the agu chapman conference  atmospheric water vapor and its role in climate , which will be held in kona, hawaii. the opportunity for this project has emerged from recent discussions between the pis and colleagues from industry, nasa's jet propulsion lab (jpl), université libre de bruxelles, and service d'aéronomie in paris. a number of important resources are being made available for this project at little or no cost to this grant. the timing seems to be fortuitous as several of the scientists involved are planning to be in hawaii for the chapman conference, and the other resources happen to be available at the same time. intellectual merit measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues provide important information about the earth's hydrologic cycle, and new technologies promise to expand our understanding of the use and limitations of such measurements. the project will help to establish the foundation for climate studies using these new technologies by providing the first intercomparison between different ground and satellite-based techniques. the results of this study will be used to better understand optimal system configurations for climatological studies of water vapor isotopes and determine biases in emerging remote-sensing technologies. moreover, the data from this project will help to constrain models of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle by providing the first continuous measurements of water isotopologues from an arid subtropical mid-ocean site. broader impacts the results of this intercomparison project will be important for the broader community of atmospheric water vapor isotope researchers as they begin to make use of the new array of remote sensing and laser-based techniques. the low humidity conditions atop mauna loa will test the limitations of the surface-based spectroscopic techniques and provide a sound footing for understanding the reliability of the instruments under extreme but climatologically important conditions. the results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at national conferences and will inform algorithm and instrument development in the united states and in europe. the project will promote the training of graduate students by including them in the field program and data analysis. during the first week of the program, jpl scientists will make informal presentations to the students from university of new mexico and colorado university on water isotope measurement techniques and algorithms. during the second week of the program, the students will participate in the chapman conference, and the pis will invite other graduate students attending the conference to join them in the field, either before the conference begins, or during the planned field excursion to the mauna loa lab by conference attendees, which will also include a presentation about this project. in addition, this project will foster partnerships with industry (picarro and los gatos) and with european colleagues associated with the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer instrument.\",\n",
       " \"adaptation to the impacts of climatic change is now at the forefront of scientific inquiry and policy negotiations, but the current debate has contributed little to the understanding of the decision-making processes that shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods.  this interdisciplinary research project hypothesizes that cyclical (loop) learning enhances people's anticipatory capacity, which is reflected in more flexible and dynamic local and regional adaptation plans.  the investigators propose a resilience-enhancing approach that emphasizes an iterative way of analyzing and learning about changes and uncertainties in the past, present, and future.  by focusing explicitly on learning processes and decision-support tools, this project is expected to reverse the deterministic notion of presumably vulnerable groups as passive victims of climate change by highlighting people's skills, knowledge, strategic responses, anticipatory capacity, and agency for adaptation planning.  research will be conducted in selected rural communities in ghana and tanzania using methods from the learning sciences, rural sociology, cultural geography, and participatory action research to understand how anticipatory learning (learning that helps people anticipate and adapt to change) occurs on the ground and how it can be enhanced.the contributions of this project are expected to be threefold:  (1) a theory regarding how anticipatory learning works in the context of climate change; (2) initial measures of people's individual and collective capacity for anticipation; and (3) pilot interventions for anticipatory learning tools.  the project will address new and important questions in decision theory with respect to processes that permit some communities to better adapt to change than others; relationships among social configuration, learning practices, and decision making under climatic risk; and dynamics in knowledge creation and action.  the project also will provide immediate benefits for the study populations, training opportunities in the u.s. and in africa, and findings that have high potential impact on the pressing human impacts of climate change.  through co-design of adaptation tools and interventions in ghana and tanzania, the research will foster people's capacity to influence their future through iterative planning rather than learning by shock.  the study will involve students in the u.s. in three ways:  (1) graduate and undergraduate students educated and trained through their direct participation in the conduct of this project; (2) undergraduate students enrolled in a course on climate change adaptation and study abroad in africa; and (3) an interdisciplinary graduate seminar to design anticipatory learning tools with african colleagues.  the u.s. investigators will work closely with researchers and practitioners at african partner institutions (the university of dar-es-salaam in tanzania, the university of ghana, and the afram plains development organization (apdo) as well as with disaster risk and development organizations (care international and the red cross/red crescent).  an award resulting from the fy 2008 nsf-wide competition on human and social dynamics (hsd) supports this project.  all nsf directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the hsd competition and the portfolio of hsd awards.\",\n",

       " 'decomposition, the breakdown of dead plant and animal material, is a fundamental process that affects soil fertility and ecosystem carbon storage. most of what is known about decomposition is from studies in high rainfall areas, but this knowledge does not translate well to dryland ecosystems.  some recent studies suggest solar ultra-violet radiation has a major influence on decomposition in drylands; however, other studies indicate the level of mixing of wind/water-transported soils with litter is the key factor. this project seeks to resolve these competing explanations through a series of laboratory studies and field experiments in arizona designed to measure interactions among these factors. these linkages will be assessed in the context of woody plant encroachment into grasslands, a globally extensive vegetation change in drylands. this investigation will yield new insights into processes that affect soil fertility and carbon storage in drylands by combining the disciplines of plant community ecology, ecosystem science and earth science in a novel framework. the findings will be relevant nationally and internationally, as dryland ecosystems characterize major portions of the us and global land area, and may be significant carbon sinks.  in addition to dissemination in the scientific community, results will be communicated to land management personnel and organizations through outreach programs.  the study will provide training opportunities for four graduate and numerous undergraduate students. the collaborating institutions (university of arizona, new mexico state university, university of kentucky and loyola university) have substantial minority enrollments, and efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups.',\n",
       " 'abstract for nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms. models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for north american birds. over the last decade, this paradigm for north american birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. this project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. the work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of north american birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. the project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. the project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western south dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms.',\n",

       " 'optical flow switching has recently emerged as a promising new approach to address the exponentially growing traffic demands in optical networks. in order to realize this new paradigm for optical networks, the core network must be capable of wavelength reconfiguration and service provisioning on time scales approaching one second or faster. the present methods used in wavelength division multiplexed (wdm) optical transmission are designed for static wavelength channels, which can increase in number over time and may be configurable to form different paths at the time of provisioning. provisioning new wavelengths is a methodical, one at a time, step-wise process of ?turning up? the optical signal along the path, which requires minutes to hours in order to achieve the final stable state, appropriate for gmpls networks. furthermore, the extensive literature on optical transmission assumes this quasi-static network environment. the intellectual merit of this project will be to determine both the practical and fundamental limitations on optical flow switched networks imposed by physical layer constraints, including optical transmission in a dynamic, wavelength switching environment. this goal is particularly challenging because of the multi-layer nature of the problem. the network topology and signaling protocols will dictate physical layer transmission requirements, such as how fast the optical signal must achieve an error free condition and over what transmission distance. likewise the physical limitations both in terms of performance and cost will motivate design choices for the architectures and protocols. in order to address the multi-layer nature of optical flow switched networks, this goali project is proposed as a mechanism to utilize the novel optically transparent mesh network testbed facility within bell laboratories to extend the network architecture activities within the nsf funded nets-find future optical network architectures program at mit. in particular, targeted experiments will be conducted in the testbed in conjunction with the optical flow switched network optimization studies at mit. this new testbed has recently been used to study both the power dynamics and the transmission performance of signals in reconfigurable optical networks. these two elements are essential for understanding the physical layer in a transparent switched network and this facility is unique in that it combines these in a broadband, long haul transmission configuration, typical of core networks. this university-industry collaboration will have broader impact at many levels. the problem of scaling optical networks to serve the dramatic rise in internet traffic has broad social ramifications. the project will enable cooperation between two synergistic research efforts to address this important problem: at mit and at bell labs. the academic participants will have the opportunity to work in a premier industrial research laboratory and benefit from the knowledge and skills specific to that environment. in the process, the program will provide a unique opportunity to merge the traditions within both organizations of promoting individual driven',\n",

       " \"scientific research:  a mitotic spindle is present in all known eukaryotic cells and its function is essential for chromosomal segregation and cell division to occur.  although much work has been directed toward understanding mitotic spindle apparatus structure and function, it is still unclear how chromosome separation is achieved on a microtubule-based structure that is itself in constant flux.  the discovery that microtubules assemble and disassemble at both ends of the spindle fiber and of the constant treadmilling of tubulin dimers toward the poles makes it difficult to envision how forces are generated to actually move the chromosomes on such a metastable structure that is not anchored in place.  for these reasons and based on theoretical considerations of the requirement for force production at the spindle the concept of a spindle matrix has long been proposed.  in its simplest formulation a spindle matrix is hypothesized to provide a stationary or elastic molecular substrate that provides a backbone or strut for motor molecules to interact with during force generation and microtubule sliding.  such a matrix could also have the added properties of helping to organize and stabilize the microtubule spindle.  four nuclear proteins in drosophila exhibiting properties consistent with a spindle matrix have been identified and will be cytologically and functionally analyzed to test the spindle matrix hypothesis.  state-of-the-art fluorescent imaging techniques will be used to determine these proteins' dynamic properties, newly generated mutants will be analyzed to gauge functional consequences of alteration or loss of these proteins, and potential interactions with microtubules and/or an essential motor protein will be probed to assess potential connections between the spindle matrix, the microtubule spindle, and motor proteins essential for mitotic spindle function.broader impacts:  the broader impacts from the project activities will accrue at several different levels.  1)  advancing discovery with a potential to achieve paradigm-shifting results.  the demonstration of a spindle matrix will fundamentally alter the molecular understanding of spindle function.  thus, this project has the potential to change textbook descriptions of mitosis.  2)  incorporation of experimental aims into training projects at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels.  the pi has mentored 25 graduate students, 34 undergraduates and 4 high school students over the years with 8 undergraduates serving as coauthors on papers.  among the undergraduates, 11 have entered graduate schools, 8 have pursued veterinary or medical training (2 in m.d./ph.d. programs), and 2 have chosen scientific-related fields (forensics, lab technician).  this level of mentoring will be continued under the proposed project.  3)  recruitment of underrepresented groups.  during her career, the pi has trained 35 women, including 6 african-americans, and 1 african-american man.  4) establishment of international partnerships.  as part of this project, a collaboration has been initiated with a group in portugal that has obtained funding from flad to send a student to the pi's laboratory for training.  5)  development of research-based educational materials.  the pi has been active in incorporating research methodology into her cell biology class in order to encourage problem-solving approaches.  she has developed a set of powerpoint slides that are available to other biol 314 instructors that is continually updated.  6)  participation in mentoring programs.  the pi has participated as a faculty mentor in a number of different programs, including  preparing future faculty  (advising graduate students on future academic/research careers),  project assist  (a program that recruits minority students to iowa to work in a corporate research setting for academic credit), the  honors mentor program  (a freshman lab orientation program for one-semester research projects for honors students), the best (biology education success teams) program (a living/learning program for orientation of incoming biology students), and ames high school partnerships for biological sciences program (to mentor high school students on research projects.)  the pi has also been very active in making presentations to undergraduate clubs (such as tribeta, the honors biology club) and area undergraduate colleges on different topics, including her research work or on career prospects in research-related fields.  these mentoring activities will be continued.\",\n",

       " 'recently, the 230th constant-flux proxy (cfp) profiling method of calculating sediment accumulation rates (ars) has become a topic of significant controversy, especially with respect to the issue of sediment focusing and its quantification.  depending on whether one derives ars using age models or cfps leads to vastly different interpretations in paleoceanographic studies.   under this award the pis will investigate sediment redistribution processes to determine the veracity of the 230th cfp.  they will measure another cfp with an independent source term, namely interplanetary dust particles (idps), and the extraterrestrial 3he contained therein.  agreement between 230th and 3he variations in varied and well-studied depositional environments in the north atlantic would constitute further support for the use of both cfps for flux normalization. the data generated on sites with known amounts of sediment focusing and winnowing will help constrain the influence of abyssal currents on idps and the sediments carrying adsorbed 230th, and will provide insights into the extent of hydrodynamic sorting of these particles. when combined with 14c and paired 3he and 230th measurement on various separated fractions of the fine-grained component of the sediment, the pis will test the hypotheses that 1) 3he is less sensitive than 230th to sediment focusing, and 2) the degree to which sediment redistribution processes fractionate 3he-containing idps from the 230th containing portion of the sediment. in the future, the proponents hope to develop a new proxy (3he/230th ratio) for changes in the strength of deep-sea currents in association with past climatic changes.   this project will involve students in their teaching, training and learning.',\n",

(b) how do don and bdon exports vary with catchment scale? and (c) how do don dynamics differ from doc and what mechanisms are responsible for these differences? we address these questions across varying temporal scales from baseflow to storm events and across seasons. contributions of don from various catchment sources are expected to change dramatically between baseflow and storm-event conditions while seasonal changes can especially influence bdon. catchment sources investigated include ? precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, forest floor, hillslope soil water, wetland soil and ground water, groundwater seeps, hyporheic zone, and streamflow. we will not only investigate how the amounts of don in various catchment sources influence don export, but also investigate how the mobility (adsorption-desorption kinetics) and lability of various dissolved organic matter (dom) constituents (e.g., hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions) regulate don export. special attention is given to differences in don and doc responses in light of hydrologic flow paths, storm event magnitude and seasonal timing, antecedent catchment wetness, and redox conditions. we address these questions across zero- to third-order forested catchments of the big elk creek in ne maryland, which are representative of piedmont catchments in the mid-atlantic region. the catchments have already been intensively instrumented, and preliminary data from the site is available since march 2007. we will implement end member mixing analysis (emma) at multiple points in the catchments to characterize the spatial pattern of runoff sources and don contributions. innovative, new, spectrofluorometric tools such as specific uv absorbance (suva) and excitation-emission matrices (eems) are used to characterize dom composition including an in-situ logging fluorometer. a strong interdisciplinary team of scientists with diverse strengths but complimentary interests will evaluate the questions. we anticipate that this study will result in the first conceptual model of don that characterizes the relative influences of terrestrial and instream processes across various catchment scales.results from this study will have direct practical implications for: (a) drinking water research since don contributes to the formation of toxic disinfection by-products; and (b) nutrient enrichment of coastal estuaries (e.g., chesapeake bay) since don is bioavailable. an on-line data archive will be created to disseminate the data and results from this study. this data archive will be linked through the web site of the center for critical zone (ccz) at the university of delaware and the delaware water resources center (dwrc). dissemination of fact sheets to practitioners in regional offices of the us natural resources conservation service, us forest service, us epa, and maryland?s forest service should broaden the impact of the proposed research. the instrumented watershed will be (is being) used as a ?demonstration? and educational watershed laboratory. this will enable us to develop new interdisciplinary partnerships with other scientists and students within and outside ud. this project will provide valuable interdisciplinary research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students from the bioresources engineering, geology, plant and soil sciences, and geography departments. under-represented groups will be actively recruited by the pi and co-pi?s with the intention of filling two or more undergraduate and graduate assistantships. a female graduate student will be the phd student on this project. the final outreach component of this project will involve the fair hill nature center and its experienced staff of environmental and experiential education teachers. the fair hill nature center is a non-profit entity, educating k-8 students about responsible environmental stewardship. the fair hill nature center educates over 8,000 school children annually. pis on this project will be actively involved with the teachers and staff of the fair hill nature center staff to provide educational seminars on watersheds, soils, and forests and will participate in student field trips to the instrumented watershed.',\n",

       " 'human civilizations have developed during the holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. the holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. however, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history.although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. glaciers in many areas on earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. the age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking.recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of holocene climate changes. this grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the holocene moraine sequences in new zealand?s southern alps by applying high-precision 10be surface exposure dating (sed) combined with local calibration of the 10be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. new zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?little ice age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our sed approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of new zealand?s southern alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on earth. to achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the southern alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. we will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from new zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the holocene glacial pulse-beat. one of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?little ice age, where detailed historical records are available for european glaciers.intellectual merit and broader impacts: we expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: were holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric?

       " \"the organization of movement is a complex and difficult problem, in part because of a  degrees of freedom problem  in motor control. the richness of an animal's movement possibilities makes its choice of movement controls complex.  however, unlike current robots, animals cope efficiently with their degrees of freedom. a newborn wildebeest calf walks with the herd within a few hours of birth. a frog or a turtle, using just its spinal cord, can control complex goal-directed trajectories. the spinal cord can also rapidly correct such movements if they are perturbed. it has been argued that these remarkable capacities are modular, constructed with small sets of primitives or motor building blocks. how such primitives arise and are used is the focus of this project.the concepts of modularity and motor primitives have provided useful descriptions of the organization of spinal motor systems. modular organization has been shown to support spinal behaviors, and may help to  bootstrap  motor learning. nonetheless, modularity is controversial at many levels. spinal primitives might need to be supplanted or augmented in order to perform complex, voluntary behaviors. this project attacks this problem in frog prey strike behaviors, a voluntary and adapted behavior in a system that is fundamentally important to the animal, and has also been well characterized in previous studies of modularity.  the neuromechanics of prey strike is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective. the importance of modular organization in neuroscience and behavior extends well beyond biological motor control, with ramifications in evolutionary and cognitive psychology. biological strategies and solutions are also highly relevant to future technologies and robotics.a computer model of prey strike will be developed using a novel approach based on cosserat strand-elements. the model will be developed by a team of four investigators: simon giszter (neurophysiology) and jonathan nissanov (anatomy, imaging) at drexel university, dinesh pai (computer science, biomechanical modeling) at the university of british columbia, and kiisa nishikawa  (neuromechanics) at northern arizona university. cryoplane microscopy will be used to reconstruct bullfrog sensorimotor anatomy in detail. these structures will be modeled using a strand-based approach to incorporate this detail.  experimental and model analyses of prey strike using these data will inform one another to establish the benefits and limits of fixed or adaptive modular mechanisms, and the biological implementation used in frogs.\",\n",
       " \"this project will identify ways to reduce wildfire hazard and the loss of imperiled ecosystems by exploring the joint effects of climate and land use changes in western oregon's willamette valley ecoregion.  three hypotheses will be tested: climate change will increase fuel loads and wildfire hazard; land development will increase the area of wildland-urban interface and alter vegetation in ways that increase the risk of wildfire and loss of imperiled ecosystems; and some management options will be more robust than others in mitigating fire risk and sustaining imperiled ecosystems across a range of future climate scenarios.  the work will employ a biophysical model that downscales from the coarse spatial scales of current climate change models to the fine spatial scales at which human land use and management decisions are made, and then scales back up to represent the landscape-scale effects of human actions on vegetation and fire hazard.  the biophysical model will be coupled with an agent-based model in which decision makers on individual land parcels respond to climate, land use regulation and incentives, land markets, perceived fire hazard, land management costs, and aesthetics.  this research will advance knowledge of how to bridge key theoretical and practical issues related to multiple types of system uncertainties, different spatial and temporal scales, and complex interactions and feedbacks among coupled natural and human systems.  the risk of catastrophic wildfire in the wildland-urban interface is a growing nationwide threat that projected climate change is likely to exacerbate.  this project supports emerging national, regional and local initiatives by providing tools to forecast risks and mitigate the impacts.  global climate change models have become increasingly mechanistic, sophisticated and spatially explicit.  however, the development of interactive models of how biological and human cultural systems will respond to climate change at the spatial scales at which land use and management decisions are made is in its infancy.  this research will produce a transferable methodology for modeling such systems that is tractable, spatially explicit, and directly linked to policy-based decision-making.  the development of solutions that are robust to future uncertainties is an important approach toward adaptively managing complex systems that include strongly coupled ecological and socio-economic processes.  the project engages graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at two universities. it also involves students with stakeholder groups in workshops designed to support policy makers and the public in making more informed decisions that address the challenges of climate change.\",\n",

       " 'the goal of the proposed work is to provide an improved understanding of snow depth ? climate relationships and the physical mechanisms involved. an extensive body of scientific literature describes the linkages between snow extent anomalies and climate, but snow extent alone does not tell the whole story. variations in snow depth, which do not necessarily coincide with variations in snow extent, may have a distinct and considerable impact on climate over a range of spatial and temporal scales. recently completed research by the pi clearly distinguishes the climatic significance of snow depth, and complements the somewhat limited existing literature on snow depth ? climate linkages. this serves as motivation for this proposal to identify the responsible mechanisms.the snow depth - climate relationship is likely to be very complicated, and involve different dynamic and thermodynamic processes across varying spatial domains and scales. some facets of this overall relationship are better understood than others, while still other facets may benefit from updated analyses using more recent data and/or modeling resources. therefore the proposed work will specifically target two aspects of the overall snow depth ? climate relationship where our current state of understanding is incomplete. two hypotheses are investigated, the first involving a remote climatic cause for snow depth variability over north america, and the second involving a local climatic consequence of snow depth variability.a key resource for this proposal is a newly released, long-term, gridded, daily snow depth dataset covering all of north america (dyer and mote 2006). its availability offers exciting new opportunities to study snow depth and its interactions with climate, especially in northern regions of north america where snow depth information has historically been lacking but is expected to vary considerably. hence this frequently neglected parameter can be empirically evaluated over a broader domain than previously was possible. furthermore, snow depth perturbation experiments will be performed using both a one-dimensional snowpack model and a regional climate model, to comprehensively evaluate the thermodynamic and near-surface dynamic processes associated with anomalous snow depth.diagnosing specific climatic causes and consequences of snow depth variability, rather than an exploratory and unfocused study of the overall relationships, hold the strongest prospects for success and impact within the hydrologic and climate science communities. recognition of snow depth as an important contributor to climate variations will promote continued improvements in the still relatively crude snow parameterizations in climate models, and also in snow depth remote sensing techniques. the concept of distinct snow depth and snow extent linkages will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of snow ? climate relationships, and provide new information to help identify additional regions/seasons which may hold some predictive capability for climate. this in turn would have far-reaching societal benefits for water resource management, hazard mitigation and anthropogenic climate change.the proposed research will be managed to maximize its broader impacts on education. despite its focused scope and relatively modest budget, the project will support three students at dramatically different stages of their educational career. an existing doctoral candidate at the pi?s institution will complete her dissertation, and ensure a smooth and efficient transition to a new doctoral student for the duration of this project. furthermore, one high school student at new york city?s prestigious bronx high school of science will be sponsored, whose research on this project will be entered in the intel science talent search competition (http://www.sciserv.org/sts/). such early exposure to research can inspire students to pursue careers in science and engineering, and foster the development of the next generation of researchers.',\n",

       " 'human civilizations have developed during the holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. the holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. however, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history. although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. glaciers in many areas on earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. the age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking. recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of holocene climate changes. this grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the holocene moraine sequences in new zealand?s southern alps by applying high-precision 10be surface exposure dating (sed) combined with local calibration of the 10be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. new zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?little ice age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our sed approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of new zealand?s southern alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on earth. to achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the southern alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. we will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from new zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the holocene glacial pulse-beat. one of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?little ice age, where detailed historical records are available for european glaciers. intellectual merit and broader impacts: we expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: were holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric?

namely, the water-gas shift and methanol steam reforming reactions. knowledge garnered from these systems has both mechanistic and practical implications for other closely related reactions of importance to clean energy, including the processing of other oxygenates derived from fossil fuels or biomass. an interdisciplinary team of experts from chemical engineering and chemistry at tufts, chemical engineering at the wisconsin, and chemistry at bnl, has been assembled for this project. at the end of the interdisciplinary effort, we will have answered key questions on the activity and selectivity of atomically dispersed metals, metal clusters, and supported surface alloys on nanoparticles of ceria, zirconia, or zinc oxide, and be in a position to provide rational designs for practical catalyst preparation. these materials will be used in fuel and biofuel processing, and as anode catalysts and films for fuel cell applications. thus, the impact of these findings will lead to better power systems design. there are several other tangible benefits for each of the disciplines involved here: new methods for catalyst synthesis, new materials properties specific to the nanoscale of importance to sensors, fuel cell components, and to catalysts; and new catalyst designs for low-cost fuels and chemicals production. an overall benefit will be a template for the rational design of catalysts derived from the interdisciplinary activities of the project. in what has become a tradition in our laboratories, we regularly exchange information with industrial colleagues. in this project, we plan to involve industrial colleagues as technical advisors, both for science and possibly for technology transfer. the interdisciplinary nature of the proposal clearly impacts the education of graduate students and postgraduate fellows. extensive training of young researchers at bnl is also planned in the project. a significant number of women students will be involved in the project, and the tufts summer scholars program for undergraduates will be used to recruit other under represented groups. the dissemination of the work will follow the normal channels of publications, presentations and meetings. to achieve really broad dissemination, a website will be created as part of the nano catalysis and energy site to promote this work both as an educational resource and a recruiting tool.',\n",

       " 'intellectual merit:because all aspects of biodiversity ultimately derive from dna-level resources, a mechanistic theory of evolution must start at the genomic level. this work focuses on the hypothesis that many aspects of genome evolution are driven by nonadaptive forces (random genetic drift, mutation, and recombination) rather than natural selection responding to external ecological forces. using mathematical/computational analysis, the research will exploit the enormous set of resources available from whole-genome sequencing projects, from viruses to organelles to bacteria and multicellular species. because evolution is a population-level process, priority will be on developing a general theory for genomic evolution consistent with well-established principles of population genetics, while spanning the fields of computational biology and informatics, molecular and cellular biology, and systems biology.the overall goal is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics. under the proposed hypothesis, many of the complex genomic features that are the hallmark of multicellular species emerged largely as a consequence of a substantial reduction in the efficiency of selection, whereas the streamlined genomes of microbial species result from highly efficient selection opposing the accumulation of mutationally hazardous excess dna. at the very least, the theory to be developed provides a null (nonadaptive) hypothesis for interpreting the evolution of genome complexity. broader impact: through the integration of these various subprojects, the overall goal of the proposed research is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics, as well as to help develop the intellectual infrastructure that will ultimately be necessary for the emergence of a field of evolutionary cell biology. in addition, the research project will be intertwined with a set of educational goals, including: 1) the establishment of an annual set of projects associated with a genome evolution class that services students from both the life sciences and informatics; 2) the recruitment of mathematically inclined biology undergraduates into a two- to three-year research program; and 3) the development of an integrative ?training-grant?-like environment among the grant participants.',\n",

       " \"we propose applying transcendence techniques to curves and abelian varieties in a family and to classical period maps to deduce transcendence properties for functions which are solutions of a picard-fuchs equation. this leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of shimura varieties. these special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain shimura subvarieties. this leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of shimura varieties. we also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of shimura varieties. we propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. a fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. a classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. this implies that e and pi are transcendental. in previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. we intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties.\",\n",

       " \"meritorious patents are a principal currency of an innovation-driven society.  they create an incentive for the production of novel inventions.  but the integrity of the patent system is compromised when, as the commissioner of patents has noted, the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) lacks optimized informational resources to determine if a patent application reflects a new and non-obvious invention, as the law requires. to date, scientific researchers have been unable to help the uspto find the information it needs. the arcane language of patent applications conveys insufficient information to enable effective communication among patent professionals and the community of scientists and others in the public who would otherwise provide valuable information and insight to the uspto.  tagging and visualization, two software-driven techniques that are used to enhance access to digital information, are in common use in commerce, but they have yet to be applied to a vast store of scientific information in the public sphere, including patents. tagging is the process by which a keyword is assigned to an item of information; it describes the information and allows it to be readily searched (e.g. labeling photos on web-based photo-sharing services).   by tagging different information with the same tag, associations can be made.  visualization refers to a variety of techniques for graphically representing relationships (e.g. graphical representations of census data or voting patters).  these two tools of tagging and visualization open great opportunities for using science to unlock essential information and make it available in a useable form that will benefit government, the scientific community and the public.the open patent project, based at new york law school's center for patent innovation, studies the application of tagging and visualization tools in the context of patents.   this project builds on new york law school's peer-to-patent pilot program, which it created in 2006, and launched in 2007, in cooperation with the uspto to improve the quality of information available to patent examiners through on-line public participation. using social networking tools, the peer-to-patent website enables self-selecting technical experts to identify and submit bibliographic information, known as prior art, relevant to examining the claims of the patent application.  data from the first year of peer-to-patent demonstrates that the public can, and does, contribute information that assists patent examiners in more effectively determining patent eligibility. using data developed through the peer-to-patent project, the open patent project takes as its premise that, for the patent system to continue to promote science and innovation, new scientific tools are necessary to enable: patent examiners to understand the claims of an application for which a patent is sought; competitors to know the scope of a granted patent in order to innovate around it; and the scientific and technical public to find and discuss patents related to their research.  the open patent project takes advantage of information generated by reviewers in the peer-to-patent project to study the effects of user-generated tagging and visualization on the exchange of information in the patent process.  experts from law, political science, information and computer science, library science and design are engaged in developing user interfaces for the development of these tags.  the new approach should enable patent examiners and the participating public to readily define and perceive patterns of association among information relevant to patents.  the hypothesis to be tested is whether enabling public tagging of patents and applications will: 1) enable scientific research communities to develop knowledge bases of patents relating to their area of research; 2) produce a demonstrable increase in rates of public participation by the scientific community in the uspto public patent review program; and 3) enable patent examiners to identify more relevant information to assist with the patent examination process.broader impacts:  this research has ramifications for improving the quality of issued patents and the exchange of information between a government agency and the scientific public, on an international basis. in addition, this research develops  new models, analytic tools and datasets that can also be applied in the science policy decision-making process in many other domains.\",\n",

       " \"the overall goal of this project is to reconstruct the low-frequency behavior of the climatological aleutian low on decadal to millennial time scales, and to assess how its variability has related to past shifts in the mean state of climate during the holocene. to confidently reconstruct past climate change, the inter-related processes that control the proxy climate indicators must be well understood. this project will continue on-going monitoring and lake-core-based investigations at nine lakes in southern alaska with the dual aims of (1) understanding the primary controls on the sedimentary changes, and (2) applying this understanding to generate the highest quality time series of paleoclimate proxies that relate quantitatively to summer temperature and winter precipitation. the investigators recently discovered two lakes that contain annually laminated (varved) sediment. these are among the few varved lakes currently known in alaska, and they present an opportunity to develop annually resolved time series of past climate variability. the low-frequency component of lamination thickness and grain-size variability at these glacier-fed lakes probably reflects the extent of ice cover in the catchment, while inter- and intra-annual variability is likely related to melt-season temperature and hydrologic factors, particularly large rainfall events. in addition to the new laminated lakes, this project will generate complementary records from lakes more suitable for ecologically based proxies, including chironomid and pollen/macrofossil assemblages, and lake-productivity indicators that respond to growing-season temperature. in addition, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms will be analyzed to reconstruct moisture-source variations, and geomorphic evidence will be used to assess holocene glacier fluctuations within the lake catchments. the intellectual merit of this study includes its multi-proxy approach designed to probe a key feature of ocean-atmospheric circulation in the north pacific: the aleutian low pressure system. this prominent center of action is linked to indices of climate variability across the pacific. it is most strongly expressed in winter when it steers southwesterly storms inland, thereby governing the spatial pattern of surface temperature and snowfall across northwestern north america. this project includes glacier and glacial-lacustrine records because glacier size depends on winter precipitation, which varies with the aleutian low. glacier size also depends on summer temperature necessitating complementary time series of summer temperature. the basic study design is to pair a glacial-fed lake (lamination record) with an organic-rich lake (chironomid record) in each of three study areas separated by 2100 km: adak (middle aleutian islands) in the far west, ahklun mountains in the southwest, and chugach range in the gulf of alaska. these three areas straddle the prominent dipole in the influence of the aleutian low. when the aleutian low strengthens, winter precipitation and temperature increase in the gulf of alaska, while it decreases in the west. moisture sources also shift with the aleutian low, and these are recorded in the oxygen-isotope ratios of lake water and the diatoms that grow within it. the multi-proxy time series will extend through the holocene, with higher-resolution analyses over two periods that encompass past warm intervals, namely the holocene thermal maximum, which took place early during the current epoch, and the last 2000 years, which includes the so-called medieval warm period, a key benchmark for 20th century warmth. the broader impacts of this study involve its synergistic activities with resource managers at us fish and wildlife service who are developing a premier environmental monitoring program in the togiak national wildlife refuge, geoscientists at the us geological survey's alaska volcano observatory who are striving to assess the frequency of eruptions of aleutian arc volcanoes and to identify widespread tephra-stratigraphic markers, and the broader community of multi- and inter-disciplinary scientists aiming to understand the causes and effects of climatic change around the north pacific, the arctic, and globally. this project contributes to understanding climatic variability, a key challenge facing society. the us climate change science program identifies  past climate variability and change in the arctic and at high latitudes  as one of its primary research objectives. the project is training three graduate and several undergraduate students in global-change research, and supports a research assistant professor in her early career. the pis have involved high school science teachers in their field research as part of nsf's polartrec program.\",\n",

       " 'the exchange of carbon between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle.  movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system.  in most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system.  if the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling.  the specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles.  a multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon.  the research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions.  outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone.  the focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for k-12 education.  the principle investigator is partnered with the math and science center of virginia.  three teacher-student teams consisting of one high school biology or earth science teacher and four 10th grade students, with priority given to students from under-represented groups, will participate in a  two-week, field-oriented institute to educate and provide research experiences.',\n",
       " 'in most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. the scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. this project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. this work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. it is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. from a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data. in practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. in carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. in addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. the pis plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as matlab, r or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``statistical analysis of online data  at berkeley and princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program.',\n",

(2000) has profound implications for long-term survival on earth and for finding life on planets such as mars. this project will continue to advance these fascinating discoveries. the research will be conducted in two different permian-aged salt formations in an attempt to duplicate the original nsf funded discovery. further, the project will gather additional samples from even older formations (devonian 320 million years of age; silurian 412 mya) in an attempt to document sound evidence for even longer term survival in primary halite minerals. due to the excellent preservation of the sites, vertical samples will also be obtained from an entire evaporation cycle in order to examine population differences that might have occurred as the saline chemistry of the ancient lakes changed over time. in addition, the project will examine these same layers in different horizontal samples of each of the mines in order to develop data regarding the spatial distribution of biological materials in each of the formations. the microbial populations in these various formations will be studied using both culture dependent and independent assays. consequently, this project will provide data on the types of microbes that are able to survive within the salts while concurrently providing the first systematic dna-based survey of microbial diversity within the formations and that may have been present during the original precipitation of the salt formations. the project also includes the first examination of these primary salt brines for the presence of bacterial viruses trapped within the ancient brines that formed the fluid inclusions within the crystals. broader impact: the project has many broad areas of impact including the support and training of several research interns, supporting training for several k-12 teachers in a joint educational effort between the pi and the kansas underground salt museum, and providing training in geobiology to a current nsf minority post-doctoral fellow who has expressed a sincere desire to become involved in the rapidly developing field of geological microbiology with a specific interest in the study of ancient biomaterials. in addition, the research focuses on an area of great public interest as it seeks to break the current record for the oldest live organism known while at the same time attempting to duplicate previous work that isolated the current record, a permian aged microbe (ca. 250 mya).',\n",

       " 'tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to holocene and younger deposits. although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. the largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms. carbonate strata within the proterozoic atar group, mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. the wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the west african craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. this project, a collaboration between the university of tennessee knoxville and ohio university, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact. this project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. both investigators have a long history of public outreach. the university of tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. these exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers in implementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern tennessee.',\n",
       " 'innovation and discovery involve individuals working successfully together in teams. it is critical for the science of science and innovation policy to understand how the cognition of individuals, the direct source of novel ideas and critical decision making, is impacted by social teamwork variables. prior research has typically studied social teamwork variables in isolation or individual cognition variables in isolation. to know how to intervene to increase engineering and scientific output, the relationships between the two must be known, or else we might improve one at the cost of hurting the other, which likely would have no net improvement in final scientific or engineering productivity. the current project examines a very large quantity of video data collected from a recent highly successful case of science and engineering, the mars exploration rover, which both wildly exceeded engineering requirements for the mission and produced many important scientific discoveries. yet, not all days of the mission were equally successful. from this video record, the project traces the path from the structure of different subgroups (such as having formal roles and diversity of knowledge in the subgroups) to the occurrence of different social processes (such as task conflict, breadth of participation, communication norms, and shared mental models) to the occurrence of different cognitive processes (such as analogy, information search, and evaluation) and finally to outcomes (such as new methods for rover control and new hypotheses regarding the nature of mars).another critical factor for science of science and innovation policy is to examine both divergent thinking and convergent thinking. innovation rarely happens unless new ideas are considered. but progress will not happen unless the best ideas among the proposed set are ultimately selected. to know how to best intervene to improve discovery and innovation, progress must be made on finding out when to intervene, which likely depends upon whether divergent or convergent thinking is currently required. a number of prior inconsistent research results likely resulted from a failure to separately consider divergent and convergent thinking. the current project examines both elements to build a much more complete model of how cognitive and social variables come together to produce new and successful engineering innovations and scientific discoveries. broader impacts: the us is facing serious challenges in the fields of science and technology. innovation must be harnessed to generate new products, create employment opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. it is vital that the flourishing of science and engineering teams be examined with the same rigor as other important human endeavors. this project also has implications for science and engineering education: as ways of composing, structuring, and instructing teams are examined, suggestions for pedagogy will be formulated based on empirical findings.',\n",

       " '0843798mustethe pi proposes to better understand and refine river discharge estimates using improved measures of rating curves. traditional river discharge estimates are conducted at times when flow is relatively normal and steady, allowing safe and convenient measurement. these measurements serve as the basis for calculating rating curves. the curves, in turn, are used to estimate flow and discharge during flood events ? possibly leading to significant uncertainty due to hysteresis. understanding the discharge-flow hysteresis relationship requires measurements during high flow events. the 2008 midwestern flood offers a unique opportunity to couple flow and discharge measurements in order to better understand and model rating curve hysteresis during extreme events. with the goal of coupling river stage and discharge, measurements will be made in a non-contact manner developed at iihr-hydroscience & engineering which uses large-scale particle image velocimetry (lspiv). this technique was initiated on june 10, 2008. funds are requested to 1) finalize the on-going measurements; 2) perform topographic and bathymetric surveys; 3) evaluate deployed instruments by conducting baseline flow measurements; 4) analyze data and report findings; and 5) produce conceptual process models and define future research needs. the unique aspect of the proposed research is the use of non-intrusive measurement techniques in a natural extreme event provided by the 2008 midwestern flood. the series of measurements will allow the pi to assess the technique and its ability to provide improved rating curve estimates under rare unsteady flow situations in natural channels. the expectation is that lspiv will provide a simple, compact, cost- and effort-effective package for providing these critical measurements. unsteady flows will be investigated in detail and conceptual frameworks will be developed in order to determine what ancillary data are needed to answer discharge hypotheses. the transformative, exploratory nature of this project will provide field testing for technical aspects of the lspiv technique to include specular reflection for free-surface tracing, optimal velocity distribution laws in the water column testing as a function of stream characteristics, flood wave raising and falling data capture, and uncertainty analysis. rating curves are the basis of stream stage measurements, yet their uncertainty during high-flow events obviates the ability to fully understand unsteady fluvial processes. river processes hypotheses regarding extreme and unusual flow regimes can be tested and the results of this study will enable river stage and discharge estimation in regions without gauging stations. integrated hydrologic-geomorphic-biological studies will be possible through a better understanding of key temporal and spatial processes in flood propagation. uncertainty in rating curves calculated during stable river flow regimes will hinder flood stage forecasting whereas this project will provide data useable by national mission agencies for more accurate flood estimates. with billions of dollars lost each year, more accurate flood data are timely and of broad interest.***',\n",

       " \"geometric topology was once a fringe topic, well studied in graduate schools but almost unknown in mainstream culture. happily, in recent years public interest has increased. the key to effectively presenting geometric topology to a broad audience is to keep in mind that explanations using words alone are sure to fail.  explanations using pictures will convey a vague sense of the intended meaning. but to deeply understand the topology of a multi-connected space, the learner must experience the space for him or herself. one of the p.i.'s missions in life --- and the subject of the present project --- is to provide computer software that enables children and other non-specialists to experience 2-manifolds, 3-manifolds, and other structures directly. for example, the p.i.'s existing torus games have already proved effective with students from fifth grade on up, leading them to the mind-stretching concept of multiconnected spaces (specifically, the flat 2-torus and the flat klein bottle). the present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include spherical and hyperbolic 2-manifolds as well as 3-manifolds.while mathematicians' and physicists' understanding of space has made tremendous progress, the general public's understanding still lags behind.  part of the reason is that, while the modern concept of space is not inherently difficult to understand, it is extremely difficult to explain in words. explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate.  the only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp a new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself.  the p.i.'s existing torus games software lets students develop a gut-level understanding of spaces that are finite yet have no boundaries;  this software is widely used in middle and high schools and is effective with students from fifth grade on up.  the present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include curved spaces as well as flat ones, and 3-dimensional spaces as well as  toy  2-dimensional ones.  cosmologists are currently investigating the hypothesis that the real universe might be finite, but no matter whether that hypothesis is ultimately accepted or rejected, spaces of all sorts (flat and curved, finite and infinite, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) play a pervasive role throughout physics and mathematics, and merit a broader understanding in our culture as a whole.\",\n",

       " \"the physics of the interaction of intense laser light with plasma when wavelength-scale particles are irradiated is investigated. while the nature of strong field interactions with atoms, molecules, small clusters and planar solids has been studied extensively for many years, how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light?s wavelength is largely unexplored. these interactions are likely to exhibit properties which are quite distinct from the interactions of intense pulses with single atoms and molecules on one hand and large planar solid plasmas on the other. this work fills this gap in strong field physics with careful, well-designed experiments that isolate the effects which are peculiar to wavelength-scale targets. previously, our investigations showed that strong field interactions could be enhanced by an appropriate choice of target particle size. boundary conditions imposed by the particles create mie enhancements in the local laser field and thereby increase the nonlinear response of the interaction. the specific focus of the current work is motivated by an important question that arose from our previous experimental and computation studies: is the nature of collisionless absorption by hot electrons around wavelength-scale plasmas different from collisionless absorption from a simple planar solid? a number of theories have recently surmised that such absorption is different at these scales, dominated by what has been termed multi-pass stochastic heating, in which hot electrons can absorb energy from the laser field by passing back and forth multiple times through the micron-scale plasma. this novel heating mechanism has been suggested as being important in a number of experiments and particle-in-cell simulations but there has as yet been no systematic experimental investigation. the current studies are designed to address this shortcoming. the experiments are designed to directly measure the electron and ion distributions generated in the collisionless heating process, and, by studying specific scalings in particles of well defined size, ascertain the importance or existence of this stochastic heating mechanism. the studies utilize a 20 tw, high temporal contrast laser at ut, electron and ion energy diagnostics, and a novel electrostatic particle injector as a target. these experiments are complemented by simulations using codes available at ut. the work is done through a unique collaboration between an academic research lab at the university of texas and at harvey mudd college (hmc), an undergraduate institution. application of these kinds of studies may aid in the development of novel bright, laser-driven x-ray sources for radiography and time resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging of other scientific applications. in addition to these scientific impacts, this collaborative work promises to make a significant and somewhat novel impactin graduate and undergraduate education. in addition to its scientific merit, and support of graduate student research at ut, this research significantly adds to the scope and number of research opportunities available to physics undergraduate students at hmc. this work represents a unique situation in which an undergraduate group is involved directly and in a critical way in larger scale strong field optics research, a field which is otherwise prohibitively resource intensive for undergraduate-level research alone. the pis have an excellent record of working together and meaningfully involving undergraduates in their collaborations. undergraduates have the opportunity to do research at hmc, travel to ut in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community. this collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seeking advanced degrees in science. furthermore the pis will continue to disseminate their work through publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and international conference as they have done actively during the past funding period.funds for this award are provided by the physics division within the nsf's mathematics and physical sciences directorate and the office of fusion energy sciences of the doe within the context of the nsf/doe partnership in basic plasma science and engineering.\",\n",

       " \"the investigators study r&d environments where opportunities to invest are constrained by imagination as well as by resources. this simple and realistic premise has many implications for the design of intellectual property, as well as for other institutions that support r&d.first, since ideas for investments do not arrive simultaneously, there is a tradeoff between preserving options and the cost of delay. investing early can preempt investments in better ideas that arrive later.  an incentive problem arises because a private recipient of an idea may not reap the social benefit of preserving options. this leads to the question of how to organize incentives so that recipients of ideas take account of social options.the investigators characterize a socially optimal threshold for accepting an idea rather than discarding it. the threshold is on the net social value. they prove that the threshold should become less discriminating as time passes without filling the market niche.  they then study how reward mechanisms can (or cannot) achieve that outcome. patents are an imperfect tool because their private value cannot be tailored to r&d cost. patent value does not scale with social value. in the special case where ideas differ only in the quality of the innovation, but not in r&d cost, patents will over-encourage low-cost ideas with low quality, and under-encourage high-value ideas that also have high cost. prizes might do better, for example, when ideas differ only in their r&d costs. the prize should increase with delay. second, because ideas must be compared in order to find the best one, it may be optimal to collect ideas, as venture capitalists do. the investigators illuminate the tension between the social benefits of allowing venture capitalists to collect and screen ideas, and the competitive goals of the patent system. they show that the optimal reward system must be more generous when ideas are aggregated in the hands of a few venture capitalists than when widely dispersed.third, the scarcity of ideas explains the open-source movement in a new way.  in many arenas, there cannot be ideas for further advance unless previous technologies are disclosed. if ideas are scarce, the relevant disclosure cannot be accomplished under contract, because it is not known where the next idea will surface. the disclosure and sharing obligations of the open source community overcome this problem.finally, the scarcity of ideas has implications for public funding. unlike patents and prizes, public support can be given when the innovator actually needs it, which is before investing. however, giving the money in advance creates a problem for knowing which researchers to fund, especially when the researchers have different idiosyncratic ideas, and different idiosyncratic capabilities. the investigators characterize the optimal blend of pre-screening and experience rating, especially when it is understood that even good ideas may fail. the project brings economic theory into closer contact with the r&d experience of recent decades. for example, the scarcity of ideas should lead to economic profit, as it did in silicon valley in the 1990s, rather than to the profit dissipation predicted by patent races. the project's broader impact is on the design of programs for funding r&d.\",\n",
       " 'significance and importance of the project.  the initiation of earthquakes on faults in the earth?s crust is controlled, incredibly, by physical processes that occur at microscopic contacts between rough surfaces of rock that touch along the fault.  despite the success of empirical friction equations in describing the results of laboratory friction experiments and producing a variety of earthquake-related phenomena in computer models of earthquakes, these equations lack a physical basis.  that is, the precise identity and nature of the physical mechanisms that  occur at microscopic contacts, and give rise to the observed friction effects in experiments, remain unknown.  the empirical nature of the descriptions reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying the physical processes at microscopic fault contacts.  without a sound physical understanding, we remain limited in our abilities to reliably apply the equations to earthquakes in nature, to obtain a better general understanding of the earthquake process, and to ultimately make reliable predictions of earthquakes.  in this transformative study, we will make use of state-of-the-art materials science testing methods, namely atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation, to provide a physical basis for friction observations at a coarser scale and thereby gain a much improved understanding of the earthquake process.  this work may allow us to learn whether we are likely to be able to detect accelerating creep on faults just prior to an earthquake and thereby predict earthquakes days to hours before an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to the built environment.  from the perspective of the scientific fields of mechanics and materials science, these new insights, gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales, have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. technical description. the overarching goals of the proposed studies are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at asperity contacts at frictional interfaces.  a more specific major goal of our study is to understand the origin of the friction state ?evolution? effect in rate and state friction, the simplest manifestation of which is an increase in ?static? friction with the time of quasi-stationary contact.  to that end, we will conduct a coordinated, interdisciplinary collaboration that will employ laboratory experiments that investigate frictional phenomena over a wide range of length scales. one outcome will be to develop constitutive equations that will allow extrapolation of these mechanisms to the elevated temperatures and longer times relevant for earthquakes. we will perform macro-scale friction experiments on rocks at brown university, micro-scale to nano-scale indentation creep, adhesion, and friction experiments in the nanoindenters at oak ridge national laboratory, and nano-scale adhesion and friction experiments in atomic force microscopes at the university of pennsylvania. to make connections between the different types of experiments and to isolate different origins of the state evolution effect, we will vary the same environmental conditions in all three sets of experiments. these include tests as a function of humidity, ph (in liquid), and temperature. all three environmental factors have been demonstrated to influence the evolution effect in macroscopic rock friction experiments. nanoindentation and afm measurements should allow us to determine the processes on an asperity scale responsible for the macroscopic behavior.',\n",
       " \"this proposal is focused on problems in applied mathematics which may be attacked using algebraic methods. there are three themes:  (1) information transmission and coding theory, (2) rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  the main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  for example, in past work, the pi has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the pi has used toric geometry and cayley-bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. the coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the pi will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.one of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from cd systems to space communication. in a perfect world, the signal sent from point a and the signal which arrives at point b are identical. in the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. in signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. so the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? the solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point b can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. it turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). one aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. a second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). this is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. the goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. the final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like boeing to model surfaces.  the pi will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines.\",\n",
       " 'in this project the pi will study how the primate retina processes and encodes visual images. the retina is an extraordinarily sophisticated optical image detector, converting a light image into a set of electrical signals, filtering these signals both spatially and temporally, and sending the output up the optic nerve to the brain. the output signals consist of multiple trains of electrical spikes organized in an exquisite and complex way, with more than 20 separate parallel pathways carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. in pilot experiments, a number of previously unknown, or poorly known, functional types of retinal neurons have been uncovered and in this research project the pi will answer the following questions: what roles do these cell types play in retinal processing? how do these neurons respond to different kinds of visual images? what information about the outside visual world do these cells communicate to the brain, and how is this information encoded? to answer these questions, a movie will be focused on the retinal input neurons (the rod and cone photoreceptors) and the electrical spikes generated by the retinal output neurons (including the new and poorly-known cell types) will be imaged and recorded by a dense two-dimensional array of over 500 microscopic electrodes. the output signals will then be correlated in space and time among themselves and with the input visual images to probe the neural code at the retina/brain interface. this research project will aid the development of future retinal prosthetic devices that are intended to restore some visual function in blind human patients with retinas damaged by photoreceptor disease. the project will also provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students in both physics and biology.',\n",

       " 'status and stigma are fundamental factors that influence the ways that individuals organize themselves in social groups. status is a social process whereby persons in groups locate themselves and others in hierarchies of influence and prestige. stigma is a process whereby members of social groups identify certain attributes as discrediting, subjecting those who possess them to social rejection and exclusion. research on status processes in groups has identified a number of attributes that act as status markers, including gender, race, age, and education. research on stigma processes has also identified a number of attributes that are stigmatizing, including mental illness and physical disability. the research literatures on stigma and status have both proliferated in recent decades, but they have operated more or less independently. mental illness and physical disability, for example, are absent from research on status processes in groups. research on stigma, in turn, does not typically attend to status-related outcomes such as influence and performance evaluations. the investigators will carry out three studies that address areas of convergence and departure between status and stigma processes in groups.the first study is an experiment to be completed at the university of maryland to investigate responses to an attribute identified in prior research as a status marker (educational attainment), attributes identified as stigmatizing (various categories of mental illness), and an attribute identified in research as both a marker of status and stigma (race) in order to determine ways in which reactions to the attributes overlap and diverge. the second project, to be completed at columbia university, is a study of implicit attitudes toward persons with mental illness. unlike self-report measures of attitudes that require the attention and control of individuals, the expression of implicit attitudes is spontaneous and unintentional. the major advantage of implicit measures is that they have the capacity to overcome social desirability biases that are common in other types of attitude measures. the third project is an audit study to test for status- and stigma-related outcomes of mental illness in employment decisions. the study involves sending job applications to employment listings, varying whether the applications specify a history of mental illness.by employing multiple methodological approaches as well as variables and measures that represent both traditions, the three studies have the potential to significantly push forward the independent research literatures on both status and stigma processes in groups. the studies also have the capacity to inform intervention programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness. although there have been several recent calls for interventions to reduce the stigma of mental illness, most of these interventions have not included a research component. because the interventions with the highest likelihood of success will be grounded in basic research, and because poorly grounded interventions may result in wasted resources and pessimism about our ability to reduce stigma, the proposed studies represent an important complement to more applied approaches to eradicate the stigma of mental illness.',\n",
       " \"the democratic party's contest for the 2008 presidential nominee went on longer and divided the party more deeply than any other such contest in recent history. by contrast, the republican party's nomination race was relatively quick and did not generate deep fissures within the party. this research will shed light on the nature of modern political parties. the party is not the formal hierarchy it may have been a century ago, in which bosses could dictate the choice of nominee to the rank and file with little expectation of resistance. today's parties are better thought of as networks of formal party groups, interest groups, and donors. it is these networks that allow parties to manage a crisis, such as an intraparty rift during a competitive election.the researchers will investigate these intraparty rifts and the role of social networks as part of the effort to heal them by conducting interviews of delegates to both the republican and democratic national conventions in august and september of 2008. respondents will asked their opinions about the major candidates for the presidential nominations, their previous involvement in party activities, their membership in various interest groups, and their cultural beliefs about the importance of intraparty democracy. respondents will be contacted for follow-up interviews in the late fall to determine the effect of fall campaigns on intraparty factionalism. the researchers will test the hypotheses that involvement in expanded party networks (including interest groups and party posts) mitigates this factionalism and that participation in such networks promotes loyalty to party rather than to a specific candidate.this research will have broader impacts on the way this presidential election season is understood by political observers. rather than making assumptions about the fractious nature of the primary season and its effect on the general election, journalists and other observers will be able to draw upon our this research for concrete measurements and qualitative assessments of these rifts. additionally, this research will also involve the use of graduate and undergraduate students at multiple institutions as survey administrators. these students will receive specialized training that will enrich their academic experiences.\",\n",

       " \"there is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons.  however, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. a key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the muon ionization cooling experiment (mice).  the main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  the goal of mice is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  a collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from europe, asia, and the us, mice is being mounted at england's rutherford appleton laboratory.  construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  this proposal requests renewal funding for the illinois institute of technology mice group in support of continued us leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the us or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  the broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a neutrino factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated universe in which we live.  in addition, the pace of mice development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  mice will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training.\",\n",

liquid) or employ an effective medium approximation adequate to predict polymer chain conformation. the research carried out in this effort   replaces the complex environment by suitably accurate (and more complicated) effective interaction.  the approach feeds into the general field of multiscale modeling, especially in polymeric systems. the domain of validity of the approach and the accuracy of its extensions are primary interests of the research.the center piece research effort develops a detailed theoretical understanding of the coupling between polymer conformation and solvent properties. a simple, yet realistic continuum based interaction-site model is used in which both polymer and solvent are built from  simple-liquid  monomers. the approach  maps the many-body chain-in-solvent problem onto a few-body single-chain problem via the introduction of a set of site-site solvation potentials. this approach fully incorporates the local solvent structure into the solvation potentials.the research evolves from recent work by the pi that (i) establishes the validity of a pair-wise decomposition of the exact many-body solvation potential for a short chain in a simple-liquid solvent and (ii) successfully applies short chain solvation potential results to long-chain systems. these initial results indicated the potential  application to a broad range of systems. the research of this award focuses on the extends the approach to a larger class of interaction potentials and thus more realistic systems, including asymmetric systems in which the polymer and solvent are built from different interaction sites and to systems with molecular (and polymeric) solvents. the effects of solvent on chain conformation and collapse, as well as multi-body correlations, are studied in each of these systems.the activities undertaken have broad impact beyond the specific research problems. this research represents an important step towards the goal of developing a complete theory of polymeric liquids based on the rigorous techniques of liquid state physics. the approach provides a straightforward way to account for solvent effects in polymer systems without having to perform computationally expensive full-solvent simulations. the results of this research are disseminated both through publication in scientific journals and through presentation at local, regional, and national meetings. the research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at the pi's

       " 'one of the most exciting challenges in contemporary science is uncovering the genetic basis for the origin of uniquely human traits. humans and other great apes are genetically very similar, yet diverse aspects of human anatomy, physiology, and behavior are markedly distinct. recent technological developments provide the ability to begin identifying the specific genes that underlie these important trait differences. this project will focus on the evolution of human diet. dietary traits are particularly interesting because the diet of early human ancestors and modern humans differ so markedly from those of the other great apes and because diet affects so many aspects of human health and disease. an interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and human geneticists will integrate genetic, organismal, and ecological information to better understand the genetic basis for the evolution of dietary traits in humans. the primary intellectual goals of this project are to: (1) screen the human genome for relevant genes using two approaches, measuring gene expression across the entire genome from humans and chimpanzees in several tissues of dietary significance using ultra high-throughput sequencing and testing for adaptation in dna sequences across the entire genome based on patterns of mutation; (2) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes implicated in trait changes during human origins through extensive dna sequence comparisons among great ape species, detailed characterization of gene expression, experimental tests of functional differences, and associations between gene expression and specific dietary traits; and (3) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes among modern african human populations that are diverse with respect to diet and local climate, through detailed analyses of genetic variation, tests for natural selection, and genetic associations with specific dietary traits. the broader impacts of this research include: collaborations and resource building with african scientists, recruitment and training of women and minority trainees, education outreach to grade school students, building two novel and informative databases that will be easily accessible through the web, and developing software for comparative analysis of primate genome sequences and gene expression.',\n",
       " 'cbet-0755632  millerthe goal of this research is to identify the fundamental mechanisms by which non-equilibrium plasmas promote combustion.  the specific focus is on examining excited species from a non-equilibrium plasma and their roles and energy efficiency in autoignition and flame stabilization.  effects of various species (atoms, radicals, excited molecules) will be studied separately in a carefully controlled environment by generating the active species in a corona discharge and then injecting them into a fuel-air mixture. reaction progress will be determined using in-situ gas sampling and laser diagnostics. recent publications have demonstrated the value of these low-temperature plasmas in promoting ignition and flame propagation of hydrocarbons.  one intriguing observation is that autoignition and flames have occurred for temperatures and stoichiometries that are outside the normal flammability limits for the fuels tested.  however, recent modeling work suggests that the increased radical concentration produced by plasmas is insufficient to produce this effect.   furthermore, existing studies have not been able to discriminate between the effect of ionic species or excited species in promoting combustion, and excited species have essentially been ignored in traditional hydrocarbon combustion studies.  finding the true mechanism is the key to effective flame ignition and stabilization not only above but also below the autoignition threshold.  this research combines the low-temperature, pre-ignition expertise of the combustion and fuels research group at drexel university and the plasma expertise of the a. j. drexel plasma institute at drexel university, strengthening the work scientifically and engaging students in the resulting multidisciplinary research activity.  the project will also leverage and take advantage of existing programs at drexel university for enhancing minority participation at the graduate and undergraduate level, such as igert (integrative graduate education and research traineeship), bridges to the doctorate, gaann (graduate assistantships in the areas of national need), gem (graduate education for minorities), amp (alliance for minority participation), and three reu site programs. introducing combustion, plasma, energy efficiency, and emissions reduction to under-represented minority students will help them to explore and develop their career interest in these fields.',\n",

       " \"people may be unaware of their own important underlying attitudes and beliefs, particularly in the domains of stereotyping and prejudice. nevertheless, these  implicit biases  significantly influence inter-group behavior in everyday social interactions. indeed, the influence of these biases often is greater than that of explicitly stated inter-group attitudes and beliefs, affecting important outcomes for members of minority groups. as such, it is critical to understand the nature and operation of implicit bias, as well as the factors that may change them or reduce their influence. to achieve these goals, dr. jeffrey sherman of the university of california - davis uses mathematical modeling with a tool called the quad model that he developed in his past research. application of this tool has shown that implicit attitudes and beliefs sometimes may reflect the automatic activation of biased associations in memory or may reflect failures to regulate the influences of such associations on behavior. the quad model can be used to estimate the independent roles of each of these factors in producing biased and unbiased behavior. there are four specific goals in this research. first, the quad model will be applied to shed light on the contextual and individual factors that influence the extent of implicit bias. implicit bias has been shown to vary significantly across social contexts and across individuals, often reflecting personal goals and motives. this research will model contextual and individual differences in implicit bias in order to better understand the factors that increase or decrease the automatic activation of biased associations and the ability to regulate the expression of those associations. the second goal is to apply a  treatment  approach to reducing implicit bias. in these studies, interventions that are designed specifically to influence either underlying associations or the ability to regulate those associations will be applied to individuals and contexts associated with enhanced activation of associations or diminished ability to self-regulate. the goal is to show how interventions can be tailored to address specific deficits in processing (over-activation of associations vs. failure of regulation) associated with increases in implicit bias. the third goal is to use the quad model to better understand the relationships among different measures of stereotyping and prejudice, which frequently fail to correspond to one another. the present research proposes that dissociations among these different measures may reflect differences in the extents to which the measures reflect the automatic activation of associations versus the failure to regulate the associations. application of the model will help to specify when and why different measures will and will not produce corresponding results. finally, the fourth goal is to use the quad model to better predict behavior in inter-group settings. measures of stereotyping and prejudice are sometimes poor predictors of people's actual behavior towards members of minority groups. the quad model can improve the ability of these measures to predict behavior by independently assessing the roles of automatic associations, the ability to regulate those associations, and interactions between these components. in sum, the purpose of this research is to improve the measurement of stereotyping and prejudice, increase understanding of the factors that increase or decrease such biases, and improve the ability of measures of bias to predict people's behavior.  implicit attitudes influence behavior in important domains of life including law enforcement, health, and employment.  it is therefore critical to gain a better understanding of their nature and operation.\",\n",

       " 'quasi-states are secessionist regions that have established internal territorial sovereignty but lack widespread recognition and legitimacy as states. despite their tenuous and contested status, such regions have long been features of world political maps. a u.s-russian research team will focus on four quasi-states in the balkans-black sea region - kosovo, transdniester moldovan republic (tmr) in moldova, abkhazia and south ossetia in georgia.  these sites were chosen because of research access, contrasting historical experiences, sources of dispute between russia and the euro-atlantic community, and the varied implementation of international norms of refugee protection and recognition of self-determination. two fundamental research and policy concerns are raised by quasi-states. first, how and why do certain quasi-states endure and, second, why are some more successful at accumulating legitimacy than others?the contested declaration of independence by kosovo in early 2008 and concern about a precedent effect render these questions particularly timely. the establishment of internal and external legitimacy in the wake of wars that defined the political unit is a key factor in accounting for the robustness of quasi-states. the specific research questions include: a) what is the character and localized distribution of the agricultural, industrial, trade, social and political dynamics of the unrecognized quasi-states? b) what factors (war experience, governance structure, nation-building and identity construction, migration or displacement, border relations and international control) helps explain these distributions? c) how do state-aspirant elites work across a variety of scales to promote legitimacy, in the wake of the kosovo precedent? d) how appropriate is it to make comparisons between these 4 cases? e) how does the enduring of quasi-states affect global norms concerning ethnic cleansing and violence?to overcome potential difficulties in accessibility and reliability, a multi-methods data gathering approach has been adopted to examine the internal legitimacy of quasi-states across a variety of scales. this includes public opinion sampling of about 1000 persons in each study site (among both residents of the quasi-states and the displaced populations), focus group discussions (including about 400 persons in all) and elite interviews. public and unpublished statistical data are also analyzed in a geographical information system, incorporating land cover change derived from repeat landsat satellite imagery over the past 20 years.the four frozen conflicts are outcomes of civil wars in the 1990s that were  characterized by ethnic cleansing, destruction of infrastructure, and deteriorating relations between the countries from which the secessionist quasi-states splintered and external supporters (russia in three of the cases).   the quasi-states themselves are often marked as grey zones of smuggling (especially drugs and weapons), money laundering, border violations, transit points of terrorists, and refuges of criminals beyond the reach of international law. without more information about the conditions inside the quasi-states (level of legitimacy with their own populations, the extent and nature of their contacts with the supporting countries, the willingness of the populations to accept territorial compromises or other settlement options, the level of inter-ethnic distrust, and border controls), policy formation and implementation is significantly removed from  facts on the ground .',\n",

       " 'the proposed research is on floer homology and its applications to low-dimensional topology. floer homology is an infinite dimensional version of morse theory which has been used to construct various invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, etc. in turn, these invariants can answer subtle questions about the respective topological objects. one source of invariants with numerous topological applications is heegaard floer theory. for example, the heegaard floer invariant for knots (called knot floer homology) is able to detect the genus of a knot. originally, all the heegaard floer invariants were defined in terms of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symmetric products. recently, knot floer homology has been given several combinatorial descriptions. one focus of this project is to find combinatorial descriptions for the heegaard floer three- and four-manifold invariants as well. in other directions, the pi will work on finding connections between knot floer homology and other knot invariants, such as the khovanov-rozansky homologies; intepreting the khovanov-rozansky homologies geometrically;  developing floer homotopy theory; and constructing new floer-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds using moduli spaces of flat connections.floer homology plays a central role in the construction of topological quantum field theories. these are toy models used in mathematical physics to develop quantum theories about the universe. they are also of interest to topologists, who study the possible shapes of space in various dimensions. an important problem is the classification of these shapes, and this is particularly difficult in four dimensions. floer homology and the associated invariants are some of the most useful tools for detecting properties of four-dimensional shapes. because our macroscopic space-time has four dimensions, this is an essential input for quantum physicists and cosmologists looking for geometric models for the universe. furthermore, recently floer homology has found surprising applications in biology, more precisely in the analysis of dna knotting.',\n",
       " \"there are two problems suggested in this proposal for further investigation. the first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. this problem has been the subject of many studies started by bill thurston and followed by bonahon, canary, minsky, brock and others. their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. however such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. the second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. a very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. these two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. the hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.a 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. the problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. the recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of thurston's conjecture. a consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. what remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that namazi will try to address in this project. similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\",\n",

       " \"the mental process humans use to comprehend a sentence, like this one,can be simulated by automata.  these automata are specific kinds of computer programs that, when run, mimic the steps cognitive scientists think occur between the point at which people read or hear individual words and when they know what whole sentences mean.in this project, the research team is constructing automata in which three factors, usually studied singly, are combined.  the first factor is the linguistic grammar, which characterizes what people know when they know a language.  the second is the control strategy, which determines the particular order in which comprehenders deploy this knowledge in time.  the third factor is the theory of memory for words and phrases.  the researchers expect these triply-endowed automata to match human performance in a variety of sentence types.  in addition, since automata can be mathematically altered to take into account alternative grammars, memories and control strategies, they can be used to gain insights that would not come easily from behavioral experiments with real people. for example, behavioral experiments with elderly adults might show the effects of reduced memory capacity on the sentence comprehension process.  however, using automata allows the researchers to selectively alter not only memory but also control and grammar, revealing the role of each in ways that human experiments could not.  similarly, mathematically rendering the automaton's grammar more spanish-like (as opposed to english-like), for example, could also yield a deeper understanding of how the three factors interact and, more broadly, how people understand one another.\",\n",
       " 'the use of digital maps, imagery and global positioning system (gps) receivers to support a range of field survey activities is perceived as an area that has potentially high payoff in terms of reduced costs and improved data quality for national surveys.  at present, however, appropriate survey methods for effectively using these resources are lacking.  the long-term goal of this research is to develop a theoretically grounded yet practical approach for designing computer-assisted survey instruments that rely on geospatial resources to support location-based field tasks.  the project will contribute to this goal by developing naturalistic decision-making models for distinct location-based survey tasks that reflect the diversity of strategies that result from individual differences (e.g., in spatial ability), and by developing model software interfaces that accommodate variation in strategies for using computers and integrating environmental and digital geospatial information.  the work will begin with building naturalistic decision-making models to describe a survey task referred to as address verification, which involves evaluating whether the location of a housing unit on the ground is accurately depicted on a map.  the model will describe how task implementation varies in relation to individual abilities, such as mental rotation of spatial objects, perspective taking, and spatial memory.  the approach involves outlining a high-level naturalistic decision-making model to describe cues (information) available to and selected by a field staff member, hypotheses (if any) that are formulated from this information, and the action selected that leads to completion of the task.  using this template, a series of more specific models will be created that describe how variation in spatial ability affects the decision-making process.  expert evaluation and field-based cognitive walk-through methods will be used to further build and refine models.  with the understanding gained from these decision-modeling investigations, models of two user-interface views will be developed for the address verification task.  the first user-interface view will be a basic interface that provides the required map functionality without taking any user differences into consideration.  the second user-interface view will be designed to be an inclusive interface using what was learned in our modeling research.  information on variation in field behaviors (e.g., preferred cues, map use, task order) in relation to spatial ability will be used to create the set of screens for the inclusive user-interface views.  survey field experts and cognitive psychologists will evaluate these draft screens in relation to their knowledge and experience with field staff behaviors.  this research is an important first step of an iterative process to develop interface design principles for location-based survey field tasks that rely on an inclusive software design approach to accommodate individual differences. this research will make several substantive contributions to both basic and applied science.  first, the project will begin developing a theoretical approach for effectively incorporating geospatial information resources in computer-assisted instruments for field surveys.  through this process, naturalistic decision-making theory will be extended to include heterogeneity in individual abilities, specifically spatial ability. in addition, user interface design approaches will be broadened to handle the context of geospatial data for a task involving scientific protocols.  the practical impact of the research will be felt in fielding surveys with improved field operations efficiency and enhanced quality of data and survey estimates for the national statistical infrastructure and other large-scale surveys.  this project will provide students in human-computer interaction, computer science, and statistics with a substantive experience with interdisciplinary and inter-organizational research collaboration.  the research is supported by the methodology, measurement, and statistics program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.',\n",

       " \"humans are remarkably adept at recognizing the actions of others, even based on movement patterns alone. this ability is most dramatically shown by  point-light biological motion  animations, in which just a few dots are visible, placed at joints or other critical places.  it is often easy to recognize which action is being performed, what the actor's emotional state is, and even who the person is. although we know this information is available, little is known as to how it is perceived. this is particularly interesting because visual motion and form cues are assumed to be processed in parallel and independent streams, yet these two types of information have to be combined for point-light displays to be meaningful. neuroimaging studies in humans have further linked biological motion perception to a regions of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus, which seems to be involved in many complex processes including social perception. with the support of the national science foundation, dr. emily grossman at the university of california irvine will investigate the perceptual means for the recognition of biological motion, and the brain systems involved. the perception tests will use a novel behavioral technique in which perceivers make yes/no decisions about biological motion animations viewed on a computer screen.  the brain work will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to test specific hypotheses of the combination of form and motion cues in biological motion perception. these experiments will also measure the tuning properties of brain regions supporting biological motion perception, something that has already been achieved in monkeys but not yet in humans.theories of biological motion draw from a number of scientific domains, including research in visual perception, social perception, action understanding and motor imitation (the  mirror neuron  system). results from the present project will influence thinking in all of these domains. the work in this proposal also involves hands-on research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, including the design and analysis of neuroimaging studies. because uc irvine and dr. grossman's laboratory both have a historical record of recruiting an ethnically diverse student population, these projects provide the opportunity to promote science among under-represented minorities. finally, as part of the pedagogical activities in this career proposal, this project will support the development of a new neuroimaging laboratory course in which students are trained in the practical skills necessary for brain imaging data analysis, a skill highly desirable in the upcoming cohort of cognitive neuroscientists.\",\n",

       " 'this research investigates the way political conflicts are influenced by sacred values, which are values that incorporate ethical or religious beliefs and are associated with human behavior that seems motivated independently of its prospect of success.  past research has approached the study of political conflicts as though they were between instrumental actors -- people and groups aiming to maximize their instrumental gains and minimize losses. indeed, rational actor models have long dominated strategic thinking at all levels of government policy. however, many key components of decision-making vary with context, across social relations and domains, and as a function of whether or not a choice has ethical or moral entailments. the guiding hypothesis of this research is that people in political conflicts make non-instrumental judgments and decisions when they conceptualize the issues under dispute as sacred values, such as when groups of people transform land from a simple resource into a  holy site.   previous research carried out by this interdisciplinary team of investigators has advanced theoretical understanding of sacred values, developed novel methods of studying their impact on political decision-making and negotiations, and demonstrated their role in non-instrumental and often violent choices in political contexts. however, scientific investigation of sacred values is still in its infancy and more needs to be done. specifically, this research: 1) investigates biological and cultural antecedents of sacred values and the social identity functions of sacred values across cultures, 2) probes the role of sacred values in influencing violent and seemingly intractable political conflict, and 3) uses this knowledge to investigate possibilities of reducing political and cultural conflict. the methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining brain imaging studies with laboratory and field experiments, surveys and interviews in order to provide  real-world  relevance for policymakers as well.',\n",

       " \"the past several decades have seen a tremendous growth in the depth and breadth of our knowledge regarding social networks.  while the majority of research to date has centered on the study of networks within small communities, the properties of networks in larger populations constitute a topic of increasing interest.  prior research has pointed to geography as a key factor in network formation, suggesting a spatial approach to the description and modeling of large-scale network structure.  further progress toward understanding the dynamics of large-scale social networks is hampered by the lack of data on the geographical structure of personal ties, and by the relative paucity of specialized methods for analyzing such data.  the purpose of this project is to address these issues through two basic thrust areas: the collection of novel data on the spatial structure of large-scale social networks, and methodological research that will allow these data to contribute to our scientific understanding of social structure.  the data to be collected will contain information about the spatial and demographic structure of personal ties at regional and national scales.  these data will enable the estimation and evaluation of models for the effects of geography on network structure, and for the impact of social networks on neighborhood-level outcomes.  the methodological research conducted as part of this project will enhance current network models -- which characterize the probability of different types of social ties between individuals -- by including the effects of spatial constraints, geographic heterogeneity, and demography.  these data and methodological contributions will enhance fundamental knowledge about the complex ways that individuals interact with other through space.  to perform these tasks, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team drawn from the fields of sociology, geography, and criminology; the team's research will leverage current developments in network modeling and spatial statistics, as well as computational advances in the simulation of networks with large numbers of nodes.  in addition to expanding our knowledge of the social ties which help knit communities together, the project will create new data and software tools that will be shared with other researchers and educators.  the practical utility of the methodology and tools developed through this project will also be demonstrated with an application of spatial network modeling to the assessment and calibration of information dissemination systems for use during natural disasters and other large-scale emergency situations.  by measuring and modeling the properties of large-scale social networks, this project will yield new insights into the social fabric in which people are all embedded.\",\n",
       " 'this proposal aims to transform research in mathematics and computer science by bringing together two major research tracks which have been progressing in parallel (albeit with nontrivial interaction). in mathematics, the object of study in many areas (including analysis, number theory, ergodic theory and combinatorics) is captured by the question: ?what random-like properties does a (deterministic) mathematical structure have?? in computer science, the object of study in many areas (including network theory, error correction, computational complexity and derandomization) is captured by the question ?can we deterministically and efficiently design objects with specific random-like properties?? the pis view the two math and cs tracks (respectively) as analytic and synthetic approaches for understanding the same fundamental pseudorandomness phenomena and its interaction with structure.computer science has been mostly a passive consumer of mathematics, relying on the mathematical analysis of structures to build desireable objects. we propose to transform this one-way use to a full fledged collaboration, through the use of the computational view of randomness to analyze mathematical structures. preliminary applications of this tool, many by the pis, have already led to major breakthroughs both in new understanding of mathematical objects and in the use of these objects as the basis for constructions in computer science. examples of recent breakthroughs resulting from this cross-fertilization include work on expanders in cayley graphs, extractors from sum-product theorems, arithmetic (and other) progressions in primes, and the use of gowers? norms in complexity. many rely on the conceptual computational tool of pseudorandomness, the inability of any of a class of tests to tell the difference between a random object and the object in question. this notion arose in complexity-theoretic approaches to cryptography, but has since had wide applicability in computer science (e.g. in derandomizing probabilistic algorithms).',\n",

       " 'the standard model of particle physics has been very successful in predicting how weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions behave up to energies so far accessible at present accelerators (1 tev at the tevatron at fermilab in chicago). however many fundamental questions are not addressed in the standard model and the standard model does not incorporate the fact that the neutrino, the lightest particle of spin 1/2, has a small mass. two candidates for explaining some of the puzzles that exist are extending the standard model by doubling the number of particles via using a supersymmetric extension of the standard model, which adds a particle of integer spin to every particle of 1/2 integer spin. thus associated with the electron, which has spin 1/2, would be a scalar particle (0 spin) called the selectron. (this particle has not yet been found). another approach is to assume our world is a lower dimensional surface (or membrane) in a higher dimensional space. this proposal by two groups, one at the bartol research institute led by qaisir shafi and one at the center for theoretical physics at the british university in cairo, dr. s. khalil is to enable four scientists from each institution to visit the other institution each year in order to foster their collaborative research on large hadron collider related physics.  as further  glue  for the collaboration the proposal is for a post-doc to be hired at the center for theoretical physics to work full time on the proposed project.  the two teams will investigate both types of extensions of the standard model. this investigation is very important because next year at cern in geneva switzerland, the large hadron collider (lhc) will start operation and will hopefully find new phenomena that will suggest what the extensions of the standard model should be. other ways of accessing the highest energies come from astrophysical observation of the cosmic background radiation, and by understanding the cosmological implications of extensions of the standard model. more specifically, this group of scientists intends to investigate supersymmetric extensions of the sm and their potential signatures at colliders, in astrophysical observations and cosmological implications. in particular they intend to study the question of whether supersymmetry can significantly modify the cp asymmetry in b-decays compared to the sm picture.  they also plan to perform a complete analysis for the minimal extension of the sm gauge symmetry that can accommodate the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, which has been confirmed by many experiments.  the broader implications of this are many. the exchange of students will be an excellent cross-cultural experience for the students. scientists trained in different cultures often have different ways of approaching solving a problem. the training of a young post-doc in egypt who will interact strongly with the american scientists involved will enhance the training of this person and strengthen high energy physics research in egypt. the partnership between the physicists at bartol and the center for theoretical physics has been very fruitful in the past and its continuation would be very fruitful for advances in the field. this project is being supported by the u.s. egypt joint board for science and technology which is funding both the u.s. and egyptian sides of the collaboration.',\n",

       " \"technical: in this high-risk, high-payoff exploratory research program, the pi investigates the mechanical behavior of low coordination number (lcn) metallic systems and their constitutive equations. the intellectual merit resides in identifying this knowledge gap and in proposing a unique set of experiments and modeling strategies to characterize lcn system mechanical properties. to date, virtually all the research on nano-mechanical properties has focused on systems whose physical dimensions are of the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. these ?nano? systems share a basic commonality with their bulk counterparts - their atomic coordination number (cn) is the same as that in the bulk (12 for fcc or hcp, 8 for bcc). a fundamental departure in mechanical behavior is expected to occur when the atomic cn changes relative to the bulk. this is because a departure from bulk cn is accompanied by a change in intrinsic properties of the system such as the cohesive energy, modulus, etc. however, little is known about the behavior of systems so small that the total number of atoms constituting the specimen is less than the bulk cn. the transformative nature of these studies can be gauged from the fact that something as elementary as the stress-strain curves for lcn systems remain unknown; the term 'poisson ratio' makes little sense in lcn systems; modulus (ordinarily an intrinsic property) itself varies with the number of atoms in the system, and surface energy effects are likely dominant. the scientific payoff lies in establishing a new framework for mechanical properties of lcn systems. the high-risk component of this research resides in the ability to reliably make such atomic sized samples and measure their mechanical properties. this is non-trivial. new experimental techniques have to be developed and new concepts have to evolve that currently have no analogs in relatively larger systems.  specific research objectives include: (1) measure force-displacement curves as a function of cn (<12); (2) infer stiffness as a function of cn from the measured force-displacement curves; (3) measure force-displacement curves for linear atomic chains and infer the dependence of  modulus on chain length;  (4) evaluate the feasibility of detecting transitions between different isomers for a given cn;  (5) develop phenomenological constitutive equations for the above and infer stress-strain curves and moduli.  non-technical: this research has significant broader impacts and implications that extend beyond the obvious gains and insight that would be made in understanding the deformation behavior of materials. results would provide a new intellectual framework for studying not just mechanical behavior of small nano systems, but also an entirely new avenue for treating the problem of deformation in bulk systems. in addition, by establishing basic or elementary constitutive relationships for small coordination systems, the research would impact ongoing studies of mechanics of molecules, biomolecules, and biological cell membranes. the educational broader impacts include training and education of a graduate student who would participate in this cutting edge research at the intersection of metals, mechanical deformation, advanced tools for testing, technique development and modeling.\",\n",

       " \"the overall goal of this study is to determine how structures at the periphery of the nucleus aid in the folding and organization of genetic information encoded in dna. within the cell, genomic dna is packaged and folded several times to fit within a small organelle, the nucleus.  this three-dimensional (3d) folding further influences gene activity. genes can be positioned close to each other in the nucleus and  interact , even though they are far apart in the dna sequence. genes also can be in contact with different nuclear compartments, small regions within the nucleus with specific sets of proteins and specific activities. though critical for genome function, the positions of most mammalian genes within the nucleus and the mechanisms that mediate their 3d organization are poorly understood. the pi has assembled state-of-the-art techniques to probe nuclear structures. these include fluorescent probes targeted to large regions of chromosomes, mouse genetic resources, and new high-resolution 3d microscopy to image the nucleus at an unprecedented level of detail. using these tools, this study tests the roles of candidate structures found at the nuclear periphery in the 3d organization of mammalian dna. one candidate structure is the nuclear lamina, a network of dna-binding filaments. this study tests the hypothesis that the nuclear lamina plays a role in both dna 3d folding and associations between specific genes. this project also tests the hypothesis that some genes cluster near nuclear pores, protein channels that span the nuclear membranes and act as  gene gates  to the cytoplasm. finally, to complement these studies of nuclear structures, specific dna sequences also are tested for roles in nuclear periphery targeting. thus, this study advances fundamental concepts of genome architecture and has far-reaching implications for structure-function constraints shaping genome evolution. broader impacts: studies of genome 3d structure in the nucleus require an interdisciplinary approach, where cell biology is combined with genomics, genetics, and biophysical methods to visualize structures in the nucleus that are smaller than one millionth of a meter. the pi is a founding member of the institute for molecular biophysics (imb), an interdisciplinary partnership that brings together the genetics and genomic resources of the jackson laboratory with the physics resources of the university of maine. this study specifically applies the imb's 4pi confocal microscope to resolve structures in the nuclear membrane previously unresolvable with the light microscope. the pi's interdisciplinary research program offers a comprehensive approach to research and training. her research is integrated into core curriculum modules in the functional genomics graduate program at the university of maine. this graduate program provides education and training to maine students in genetics, genomics, and biophysics to prepare them for the next frontier in biological systems research. furthermore, this study integrates high school and college students in the jackson laboratory's summer student program, which successfully targets women and minority students and provides them with an outstanding first research experience. further developing our understanding of genome structure and function also has broad-reaching societal impacts. the public sector has heavily invested in whole genome sequencing projects, and the proposed research program puts this investment into action by dissecting the molecular mechanisms that take the dna sequence and form it into its active state in 3d within the cell. the knowledge gained from this study will become key building blocks of the systems biology of genomes on a large scale, providing a structural framework for how genes can physically associate together and interact within the nucleus. because genomic primary sequence organization is similar in many organisms, findings uncovered here for 3d genome organization are likely to apply to many species.\",\n",

       " 'the main objective of this project is to increase the number of students who will pursue scientific careers that effectively integrate the mathematical and biological sciences. the integration of these two areas will be based on the stress response system in mammalian cells and on iron uptake system in e. coli. the stress response system is central in biology, since it protects the cell against dramatic changes in the environment. this project will add a new dimension towards understanding stress phenomena at a molecular level by using a theory of stochastic nonlinear gene regulatory networks.  the project also includes mathematical and experimental aspects of biological processes that are regulated by iron in the e. coli bacterium. organisms generally respond to iron deficiency by increasing their capacity to take up iron and by consuming intracellular iron stores. while the iron-regulated system in bacteria is different from that of the stress response in mammalian cells, students will recognize that mathematical questions unify the projects.  the mathematical theory used by students in this project offers a promising way to create algorithms for genetic circuitry design, a critical area for our next generation of scientists.   the project builds upon the idea that to fully contribute to a joint research project at the intersection of mathematics and biology, undergraduates in mathematics must overcome apprehensions they may have about working in a  wet  lab and biology students must overcome apprehensions they may have about mathematical studies.in spite of the uneasiness among certain students of working in a wet lab, we have found that mathematically inclined students perform well when they are challenged to follow a very precise sequence of steps that constitutes the core of any molecular biology assay.   we thus believe that the route for a mathematically-oriented person to get involved into biology is to be immersed in a wet lab environment as soon as possible at undergraduate level. the approach taken for the mathematics-apprehensive biology students is to teach them that mathematics is useful as a rich source of hypothesis. in the hands of biologists, this hypothesis can lead to new valuable experimental designs. the goal for the biology students should be to become capable of reading the symbolic mathematical information and correlating it with the underlying biological model.',\n",
       " 'the goal of this project, which lies at the interface between mathematics and biology, is to develop mathematical models of tumor growth that connect intra-tumor molecular and cellular properties with critical tumor behaviors, such as invasiveness, and experimentally observable properties such as morphology. the research group will (1) perform novel analytical and computational studies of important constituent processes, (2) incorporate experimental data into these studies, and (3) develop and apply state-of-the-art numerical algorithms to large-scale computations over multiple time and space scales. by integrating experimental data with sophisticated, multi-scale mathematical and computational models, the potential for breakthroughs that will significantly further the understanding of tumor biology are great, thereby addressing a pressing national and global need. solid tumors are complex micro-structured materials, where the three-dimensional tissue architecture (morphology) and dynamics are coupled in complex, nonlinear ways to cellular characteristics and to molecular composition and structure of the growth environment. this close connection between the tumor morphology and the underlying cellular/molecular dynamics has fundamental scientific importance in that the cellular dynamics that give rise to various tumor morphologies also control its ability to invade the host tissue. this allows observable properties of the tumor, such as its morphology, to be used to both understand the underlying cellular physiology and predict the tumors invasion potential. in particular, the conjecture that diverse morphologic patterns of invasion observed during tumor growth are the quantitatively predictable result of molecular inhomogeneity (of both composition and structure) in the tumors growth environment will be tested. because tumor cells use similar or identical migration and proliferation mechanisms as normal cells, and because of the multi-scale nature of these processes, the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation that will be conducted in this project will also have application in understanding normal functional processes during development, wound-healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. this project will also establish a new collaboration among five institutions and broadens the participation of women and minorities in research as trainees in the investigators? groups, thereby addressing national needs. it will provide interdisciplinary training with theoreticians and experimentalists at the interface between mathematics and tumor cell biology. finally, a month-long summer cosmos (california state summer school for mathematics and science) course at uc irvine will be developed for high school students on these topics. this course enhances the participation of gifted high school students in research, and helps to recruit new math and science undergraduates, which addresses another national need.',\n",

       " \"diagnosing teachers' multiplicative reasoning (dtmr) addresses the assessment component of the dr-k12 contextual challenges strand. investigating knowledge that teachers need to enable students' learning and developing assessments of that knowledge are central challenges for mathematics education. one approach emphasizes correlations between amounts of teachers' knowledge and students' achievement for accountability purposes. another, grounded in research on mathematical thinking, often uses case studies to investigate teachers' capacities for identifying and building upon opportunities in students' problem-solving strategies. tensions exist between these approaches because instruments convenient for assessing large numbers of teachers are insensitive to capacities for reasoning, while case study methods used to investigate teachers' reasoning are not practical with large samples. the dtmr project is building a demonstration instrument both suitable for use with large samples of teachers and informative about their capacities to reason about content in ways that support students' thinking. in particular, the dtmr project is developing and evaluating a test form that diagnoses teachers' capacities in two closely connected cases of reasoning about multiplicative relations among quantities. the first is on on measurement that often relies on multiplicatively nested levels of units when partitioning a given quantity. the second is on covariation that often relies on multiplicative relations between distinct quantities. the project is focusing on aspects of such reasoning that are interconnected and fundamental to addition and subtraction of quantities, multiplication of quantities, quotative and partitive division of quantities, and ratios of quantities. the project will consider fractions, decimals, and ratios. a main goal of the project is to address content and construct validity of the demonstration form in sufficient depth so that larger scale work and predictive validity studies may follow. the project is developing instruments using a new class of psychometric models called cognitive diagnosis models (cdms). using cdms involves specifying components of reasoning in a particular domain and then constructing test questions (typically multiple-choice) systematically so that each choice corresponds to reasoning with a different combination of those components. drawing on the research on students' and teachers' multiplicative reasoning, the project is developing one test form of 30 to 40 items. cdm simulation studies of estimation and equating methods are also an important component of the project.\",\n",
       " 'technical summary:this award supports theoretical research  and education in the properties of nanostructures which have the potential to function in future electronic devices which are based on electron spin dynamics instead of traditional charge dynamics. researchers will investigate the mechanisms of spin transfer and spin transport in molecular magnetic nanostructures, in static and dynamic cases, where the spin-orbit interaction is significant. research builds on the known property that  spin degrees of freedom in materials couples to orbital motions of electrons and the observation that this plays an  important role in molecular nanostructures where one observes current-induced magnetization reversal and anomalies in the kondo effect.  research will identify how the spin-orbit interaction in nanostructures can be controlled by changing geometry, adsorbed molecules, chemical composition, or applied electric field.the nanostructures under study are nanoscale magnetic molecules (diameter of a few nm), particularly single molecule magnets with substantial spin-orbit coupling, (i) adsorbed onto nonmagnetic or magnetic metal surfaces, and (ii) bridged between nonmagnetic or magnetic electrodes. the specific objectives of the research are (a) to quantify the spin-orbit interaction for the molecular nanostructures using a first-principles method, and (b) to investigate the effect of the spin-orbit interaction on the spin transfer and spin transport through the molecular nanostructures, using both model hamiltonians and realistic atomic-scale simulations based on a first-principles method and nonequilibrium green?s function method. especially when the magnetic molecules are adsorbed on a ferromagnetic surface or electrodes, large spin transfer is expected due to a strong coupling between the molecules and the surface or electrodes. the proposed realistic simulations will lead to results of almost immediate relevance to experiment (such as an amount of spin transfer for given nanostructure) and to theory (for example, the coupling between the molecules and the electrodes), as well as will provide guidance to theory and experiment. this research will be conducted with the participation of graduate students, who will be trained in modern methods of theory and computer simulation as applicable to nanoscale systems, preparing them for careers in science and nanotechnology. the pi will connect the research activities with the educational activities at her institution, thereby making connections between the course material and real-world applications and up-to-date research to allow the students to acquire perspectives and skills in tackling scientific problems. finally the research will be performed in collaboration with scientists from the us and abroad, strengthening and enriching the us ties to the international community. non-technical summary:this award supports theoretical research and education in the properties of nanostructures which have the potential to function in future electronic devices which are based on electron magnetic characteristics associated with the spin  of the  electron  instead of traditional charge dynamics which is the basis of normal electrical current. researchers will investigate the mechanisms of spin transfer and spin transport in ultra small scale molecular magnetic nanostructures.  research builds on the known property that electron spin couples to motion of electrons and the observation that this plays an  important role in molecular nanostructures where one observes current-induced magnetic phenomena.  research will identify how the spin-motion interaction in nanostructures can be controlled by changing geometry, adsorbed molecules, chemical composition, or applied electric field.this research will be conducted with the participation of graduate students, who will be trained in modern methods of theory and computer simulation as applicable to nanoscale systems, preparing them for careers in science and nanotechnology. the pi will connect the research activities with the educational activities at her institution, thereby making connections between the course material and real-world applications and up-to-date research to allow the students to acquire perspectives and skills in tackling scientific problems. finally the research will be performed in collaboration with scientists from the us and abroad, strengthening and enriching the us ties to the international community.',\n",

       " 'hemichordates are a group of marine invertebrates comprising over 100 species of solitary and colonial wormlike creatures. hemichordates have figured prominently in hypotheses of the evolutionary origins of chordates because they are relatively primitive relatives of vertebrate animals. because of their primitiveness, hemichordates also provide a key comparison group to understand the evolution of key innovations of vertebrates, such as gill slits and a hollow nerve chord.  however, hemichordates have not been studied in depth, and evolutionary relationships within the group are not well understood. the proposed work will use genomic approaches to identify genes that will elucidate evolutionary relationships among the hemichordates and clarify the evolutionary history of the vertebrates in a broader sense. results of this research will provide a greater understanding of cellular, genetic, and developmental programs that were likely present in the ancestral lineage that led to chordates and have been evolutionarily conserved during vertebrate evolutionary history. understanding hemichordate evolution is central to research in fields ranging from neurobiology to developmental biology to physiology, and the results of this research will be of wide interest to many fields of science. the project will support training of students at various levels from k-12 to graduate school. undergraduates, including members of underrepresented groups, will participate in the project through courses on the campuses of auburn university,  the university of washington, and the friday harbor marine laboratories.  the research will be publicized through talks to public schools, web-based outlets, and introductory biology textbooks.',\n",

       " 'particle image velocimetry (piv) is a method for obtaining a fluid velocity field based on the translation of particles between images with a known time span between them.  a potential limitation of piv is that only two-dimensional velocity field along a single plane can be obtained from a two-dimensional image.  this limitation is normally overcome by designing the experimental flow system so that the third velocity component is either zero or unimportant.  in many applications, however, it is not possible to simplify the fully three-dimensional velocity field (e.g., in the left ventricle of the heart), and the two-dimensional limitations associated with piv analysis are a significant problem that must be overcome.  would it be possible, however, to combine the two-dimensional piv data together with a fully three-dimensional numerical approximation to the navier-stokes equations and obtain a sufficiently accurate three-dimensional velocity field in a domain such as the left ventricle of the heart?  the use of least-squares finite element methods (lsfems) is proposed here to approximately solve the navier-stokes equations, and, significantly, to weakly constrain the solution along the piv plane to match the experimental data.  the piv data would basically act as an internal boundary, and the numerical solution would weakly match the data with a variable weighting that determines the strength of the coupling between the data and numerical solution.  lsfems are uniquely well suited for solving an over-constrained problem like this in a computationally efficient manner.echocardiologists have developed methods for introducing microbubbles into circulating blood that can be resolved using ultrasound.  the location of the microbubbles combined with the high temporal resolution of ultrasound allows the local blood velocity to be determined using particle image velocimetry, but the high temporal resolution requirement also limits the ultrasound scans (and, hence, the velocity field data) to two dimensions.  one goal of using the fda approved microbubbles is to use the blood velocity data to calculate physiologically important information such as pressure gradients and energy loss for the blood flow, but these calculations require a full three-dimensional velocity field.  the goal of the proposed research is to develop mathematical techniques that combine computational fluid dynamics with experimental velocity data, such as that from microbubbles, to obtain a full, three-dimensional velocity field, thus providing greater insight into the dynamics of the flow.',\n",
       " \"accurate and rapid numerical solution of the helmholtz and related partial differential equations in complex geometries is key to future progress in device design, in imaging, and in basic science.  however, at high frequencies (many wavelengths across the system) this becomes prohibitively challenging using direct discretization, due to the multiscale nature of the problem.  the investigator seeks to build upon boundary-based methods which have been uniquely successful (up to a thousand times faster than the competition) in solving eigenmode problems hundreds of wavelength in size with spectral accuracy in two dimensions, and to extend them to the scattering problem, to more general media and periodic boundary conditions, and to three dimensions.  these methods are global approximation by particular solution basis sets, and the scaling method for dirichlet eigenmodes.proposed extensions include: 1) use of fundamental solutions basis sets, and their analysis via the role of singularities in the analytic continuation of the wave field, 2) exploiting a little-known analytic formula for the fundamental solution in linear graded-index materials, enabling non-piecewise-constant media to be solved on the boundary, 3) error analysis of a reformulation of the scaling method via the dirichlet-to-neumann map for the domain, 4) application of such methods to the spectrally accurate solution of dielectric photonic crystal band structure, and to `quantum chaos' (the wave and spectral properties of cavities with ergodic ray dynamics).the impact of our technology such as radar, microwave communication (eg cellphones), optics and lasers, acoustics, medical ultrasound imaging, and miniaturized quantum devices has been, and will continue to be, profound and far-reaching.  to design all such devices, one must calculate how they will reflect, guide and trap waves, and this is a time-intensive, difficult and sometimes unreliable computation.the computer algorithms proposed by the investigator will make such calculations faster and more accurate, particularly when the objects are large or complicated in shape.  this is expected to lead to improvements in the design of, for example, optical signal-processing devices (which rely on microscopic periodic structures the size of the wavelength of light), promising candidates for the next generation of fast (post-silicon) computers.  a deeper grasp of quantum chaos (the behavior of waves trapped in cavities which cause chaotic bouncing ofrays) would impact nanoscale quantum wave devices such as quantum dots, super-fast quantum computers, as well as areas of pure mathematics and physics theory.  the proposal also provides training in applied and computational mathematics at both graduate and undergraduate levels, and a course on the ``mathematics of music and sound'' introducing non-majors to waves, modes, and resonance.\",\n",

       " 'the principal physical impetus for the projects studied in this proposal is to gain an analytical understanding of pattern formation. in particular the pi seeks to characterize the classes of defects that appear when one is far above the parameter threshold at which patterns emerge. these issues are studied through a non-convex variational problem known as the regularized cross-newell (rcn) model. unlike similar models that have been studied recently, rcn incorporates features of non-trivial twist which enable the existence of a richer ?taxonomy? of defects (in particular, concave and convex disclinations). such features are indeed seen in experiments and numerical simulations of the underlying microscopic physical equations. the issue has been to determine whether or not the variational model can capture these defects. in a recent work the pi has demonstrated that the minimizers of a variational model with twist must necessarily differ from those without twist. the main projects of this proposal are centered on establishing a precise analytical characterization of the competition between microstructure formation and overall topologically induced energetic stress in versions of the rcn model having some geometric symmetry. the study of pattern forming systems is a fundamental area of scientific investigation in which the tools of modern mathematical analysis can be brought to bear on the modeling of physical systems especially near a critical transition in the behavior of the system. for the projects studied in this proposal one is principally interested in patterns that arise when a continuous translational symmetry is reduced, at a critical threshold, to a discrete periodic symmetry resulting in what is often referred to as a  striped  pattern. such patterns are for instance generic in rayleigh-benard convection (rbc) which is a principal theoretical model for the formation of weather patterns. in rbc the striped pattern corresponds to the formation, at a critical temperature, of periodic  convection rolls  of a uniform characteristic width. a major goal of this research is to study not just the patterns that form at a critical threshold but to characterize the types of defects that arise in these patterns when one is far from threshold. this work will make definite predictions on defect formation that can be tested in the laboratory. this will have relevance for modeling defect structure in liquid crystals, in animal coat patterns (including fingerprints) and in the evolution of plant patterns.',\n",

(bass et al., 2003; tull et al., 2003; tull et al.,2005).broader impacts: this project will have broader impacts in four critical areas. foremost among these is an increase in the number of ph.d. degrees awarded to underrepresented minorities in stem disciplines. improving the environment for minority stem graduate students necessitates a change in the environment for all graduate students. therefore, the project will have broader impact on graduate education generally, with these changes being institutionalized at promise institutions. third, the project will provide a broader and more holistic approach to graduate education that produces graduates who are prepared for academic careers. finally, the project fosters partnerships that lead to impacts beyond promise. this impact is achieved by building partnerships with other nsf funded initiatives such as the recently funded igert and engineering research center. these partnerships can achieve broader diversity, fostering connections between faculty at promise institutions and colleges and universities that have a high production of minority stem bachelor?s degrees for lasting change in recruiting and research collaborations, and building relationships with professional societies and nsf projects outside of maryland.',\n",

       " \"technical summary:this award supports research and education on  density functional theory. the work develops a series of improvements in the theory based on insights gained from modeling exchange-correlation holes and energy densities in si crystal and other systems.   the approach  focuses on using the laplacian of the density. the change in density about an electron?s position due to pauli exclusion and coulomb correlations and the change in the local energy due to the existence of the hole are key theoretical inputs to this approach at enhancing density functional theory (dft). the research employs a growing body of data comparing quantum monte carlo simulations of the exchange-correlation holes and energy density in realistic systems with those from density functional theories, such as the local density approximation (lda). the pi and others previously showed a strong linear correlation of the error of the hole with the local laplacian of the density. in this research, the correlation  is quantified with a model transferable to a number of different systems. this research effort incorporates the essential physics revealed by these studies into preexisting, widely used dft?s with only minor changes. the research implements a series of changes to current dft models based on the model and data previously acquired. the activities include developing a test-bed of basic solid-state and molecular systems to test the performance of these models with respect to energies and ground-state structures. as a result, this research improves dft predictions for semiconductor structures and facilitates extensions to include other properties of the energy functional known to depend on the laplacian of the density.the work has broader impact beyond the specific research investigations including education and  relevance to growing device technologies. the work adds a deeper understanding of the key inputs of existing dft models. the result is a more robust description of exchange-correlation potentials and ground-state structural properties without a significant increase in computational cost. scientific impact follows from the fact that density functional theory is  the most important computational tool for electronic structure in materials science and quantum chemistry. thus an improvement in the predictive power accomplished under this award has a potentially significant impact on a wide range of applications and fields. the broader impact extends to economic development. the pi's institution, ball state university, is

       " \"non-technical abstract cloud computing  is a term that has gained prominence recently to describe the use of a large body of compute resources located at many different locations. these resources are typically owned by third-party organizations and are made available to consumers in terms of the capabilities of each computer rather than the underlying hardware in use. this model proved its success almost immediately in the web services hosting domain, the principle target for most cloud service providers. our aim here is to determine whether these same resources can be adapted for scientific purposes. thus we propose to develop applications of cloud computing for scientific calculations and making such calculations feasible for working scientists lacking sufficient compute resources at the present. modern scientific applications require high-performance computing facilities which are beyond the reach of many practitioners who lack both the experience and funding to complete serious scientific calculations, even though their work might be enhanced by currently feasible calculations.technical abstractthe goal of resource virtualization is to divorce workflow from locality constraints, thereby allowing it to migrate freely amongst available physical resources. this flexibility yields tremendous scheduling advantages, as jobs can be placed and often migrated in order to make the most efficient use of available hardware. resource virtualization is certainly nothing new. for example, condor allows a user to access a large pool of compute resources, each one of which may be a completely unique hardware configuration. condor's virtualization strategy is to  trick  the application into thinking that it is on the home machine. the drawback is that condor must replace system libraries, which are architecture- and os-specific. hence, this strategy can be very time consuming to support. another virtualization strategy uses ?grid computing.? writing an application that is  grid-enabled  means writing an application with the appropriate protocols in place so that it can be moved around by the grid middleware. the disadvantage here is that most scientists do not have the background or the time to write grid-enabled programs.we argue that within administrative differences between cloud and grid computing can be found the potential for cc's most intriguing and useful advantages. for instance, amazon?s ec2 ( elastic compute cloud ) provides not just another web services platform, but a fully virtual computer. an ec2  compute instance  gives you a comprehensive set of virtual hardware, complete with disk space, ram, and ip address. on this virtual platform, you then install your own operating system. the compelling aspect of this strategy is that it virtualizes exactly what needs to be and no more: the hardware. doing so provides the utmost extreme in generality: if i can run an application on the desktop sitting in front of me then i can run it in the amazon cloud.the goal of this work is to test this idea and compare the performance and economy of this amazon cloud approach with a traditional computing cluster.\",\n",

       " 'the conference  constitutive properties of biomaterials  at the university of pittsburgh will be held under the auspices of the society for natural philosophy in september 2008.  mechanics plays an important role in biology at every length scale, from molecular to tissue level. the complexity of cell microstructure and organic nature of living materials require new theoretical frameworks for design and interpretation of new classes of experiments. behavior of biomaterials results from interactions of constituents on multiple length and time scales which cannot be treated by theories developed with traditional materials in mind. recent advances in this field include development of more general continuum theories and derivation of average properties of structured materials from microscopic and molecular level considerations. the goal of this conference is to facilitate a fruitful interaction between the experts in experimental study of biomaterials on one hand and mathematical modeling and nonlinear continuum mechanics on the other. particular emphasis will be placed on characterizing the response of biomaterials at the continuum level within the framework of finite elasticity and related theories and the development of new theories of mechanics of living matter that account for growth, aging and adaptation.biomechanics is a highly interdisciplinary scientific field that has already provided crucial contributions to understanding of human health, diseases, injuries and their treatment. continued progress in this area will make it an integral part of health care delivery in the future. this conference contributes towards this goal by promoting the exchange of ideas in this important field and enabling new interdisciplinary collaborations that will advance understanding of the role of mechanics in biology. the conference also serves a vital educational purpose by promoting participation of students and junior researchers and exposing them to an exciting and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field that will become even more important in the future.',\n",
       " 'as the field of quantum information processing (qip) matures, so do its goals. in particular, we are looking for more realistic and better scalable systems, for novel areas of application and stronger crossfertilization with other areas in physics. in this proposal, we are addressing all of these goals. we propose to deepen and expand our investigation of polar molecules for qip, specifically with a view towards feasibility, scalability, and connection with novel solid state and hybrid systems. we want to explore similar setups for efficient deterministic optical quantum computing systems that also could be used for efficient switches and transistors.first, we want to expand the idea of using single polar molecules for qubits. polar molecules are ideal because of both recent fast progress in cooling and trapping promising similar densities as neutral atoms and of ion-like ease of manipulation. we described a deterministic and robust scheme where we can switch molecular dipole moments on and off using the rich level hierarchies in molecules. here, we want to suggest, (i) generalized criteria for polar molecule-based qip, (ii) the use of solid state rare gas matrices as an ideal and novel architecture in which molecules can be stored very closeand with nearly no relative distance uncertainties, thus maximizing the potential of the dipole-dipole interaction even beyond nearest-neighbor interactions, (iii) a hybrid-type nano-fiber/molecular trap design to both trap and couple the molecules, potentially on a so-called ?molecular chip. the objective of the second part of the proposal is to introduce dipolar arrays as tools for deterministic optical quantum computation. the idea of this is to treat photons as qubits. since photons do not interact directly, a non-linearity has to be introduced in order to create a two-qubit gate. we propose to create singlephoton nonlinearities by sending dark-state polaritons, photon molecule coupled excitations, through a dipolar medium subject to dipole-dipole interactions.while propagating, the photons thus accumulate a nonlinear phase shift that can be interpreted as a phase gate. we propose to (i) describe in detail the process including interrelation between density, propagation length, coupling, and dipole-dipole interaction strength in order to create an efficient phase gate; (ii) to give an overview over the most important decoherence sources, such as non-symmetric excitations and phonons and their typical strengths for particular setups; (iii) in order to battle decoherence to investigate the possibility of using so-called ?many-body protected manifolds? which introduce a bias between symmetric and non-symmetric state manifolds and thus mitigate phonon decay; (iv) to study optimal dimensionality and geometry and connect these with similar architectures as suggested in the first part of the proposal; and (v) to give an outlook to novel solid state setups such as si surface quantum dots and semiconductor bound excitons in connection withthe proposed idea.',\n",

       " \"a fundamental question in the analysis of democratic governance is how the performance of politicians is linked to voters' decisions. this proposal requests support for theoretical and experimental research on such electoral accountability. in particular, the project will examine two mechanisms, learning, where voters use past performance as an indication of politicians' underlying characteristics, and sanctioning, where voters reward politicians for good performance and punish them for poor performance, by which accountability can be achieved. each of these views leads to distinct conclusions about how institutions affect accountability. as such, understanding each mechanism's distinct role and their interaction has important implications both for the scholarly study of democratic governance and for the design of institutions to improve accountability.the theoretical analysis will show that the standard view of sanctioning is incomplete-in an important sense, it mischaracterizes how sanctioning works. given this, the experiments will test the hypothesis that in a wide variety of natural models of accountability, sanctioning and learning operate simultaneously and that learning can dominate sanctioning. the project characterizes how and when that occurs.this project has important broader impacts for political science and for policy makers. there are a number of areas, such as term limits, district magnitude, and transparency of policy-making, where the policy implications of models of political accountability depend on whether one focuses on sanctioning or learning. if both mechanisms are actually operative, existing policy conclusions may be incorrect or incomplete. this research also provides opportunities to enhance the training of graduate students through involvement in the construction, design, implementation, and analysis of experiments. finally, the experimental data collected will be made publicly available so that other researchers can explore further questions related to electoral accountability.\",\n",

       " 'wayfinding is an essential capability for any person who wishes to have an independent life-style. it requires successful execution of several tasks including navigation and object and place recognition, all of which necessitate accurate assessment of the surrounding environment. for a visually-impaired person these tasks may be exceedingly difficult to accomplish and there are risks associated with failure in any of these. guide dogs and white canes are widely used for the purpose of navigation and environment sensing, respectively. the former, however, has costly and often prohibitive training requirements, while the latter can only provide cues about obstacles in one?s surroundings. human performance on visual information dependent tasks can be improved by sensing which provides information and environmental cues, such as position, orientation, local geometry, object description, via the use of appropriate sensors and sensor fusion algorithms. most work on wayfinding aids has focused on outdoor environments and has led to the development of speech-enabled gps-based navigation systems that provide information describing streets, addresses and points of interest. in contrast, the limited technology that is available for indoor navigation requires significant modification to the building infrastructure, whose high cost has prevented its wide use. this proposal adopts a multi-faceted approach for solving the indoor navigation problem for people with limited vision. it leverages expertise from robotics, computer vision, and blind spatial cognition with behavioral studies on interface design to guide the discovery of information requirements and optimal delivery methods for an indoor navigation system. designing perception and navigation algorithms, implemented on miniature-size commercially-available hardware, while explicitly considering the spatial cognition capabilities of the visually impaired, will lead to the development of indoor navigation systems that will assist blind people in their wayfinding tasks while facilitating cognitive-map development.',\n",
       " 'abstract  intellectual merit: dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (dhf) to tetrahydrofolate (thf) using the cofactor, nadph.  because of the pivotal role of thf in one carbon metabolism, chromosomal dhfrs are targeted by many drugs, including trimethoprim. bacterial resistance to trimethoprim occurs; one mechanism is production of a novel, r-plasmid encoded (r67) dhfr, which is not homologous in sequence or structure with chromosomal dhfrs.  r67 dhfr is interesting as it is one of the smallest enzymes known to self-assemble into an active homotetramer. this dhfr variant possesses 222 symmetry and a single active site pore, which binds both substrate and cofactor utilizing a promiscuous surface.  binding and catalysis in r67 dhfr operate under catch 222 conditions due to the symmetry in the pore, which allows each binding surface to interact with either dhf or nadph.  also any catalytic group that might help catalysis will appear four times due to the 222 symmetry, also suggesting a non-optimal active site configuration.  from these and other considerations, r67 dhfr appears to be a good model of a primitive enzyme.  a study of how this enzyme works will be undertaken using  steady state kinetics, isothermal titration calorimetry, directed evolution and other techniques.      water has recently been found to play a critical role in r67 dhfr function as there is a net uptake of water upon dhf binding, as probed by osmotic stress studies.  requiring water to serve as a co-substrate results in the enzyme being sensitive to water activity.  this hypothesis is confirmed in vivo by the decreased abilities of mutant r67 clones to confer trimethoprim resistance in the presence of added osmolytes.  to probe the mechanism by which water uptake occurs, the effect of neutral osmolytes on free ligand will be examined.  alternatively, to determine if osmolytes operate on bound dhf due to a poor fit between substrate and enzyme, several mutations will be used to decrease the pore size.  to study any contribution of water reorganization on the enthalpy change associated with dhf binding, d2o will be used as the solvent and isothermal titration calorimetry used to monitor the thermodynamics of the interaction.  solvent isotope effects on primary nadph kinetic isotope effects will be monitored to determine whether protonation is concerted or precedes hydride transfer.  as hydrostatic pressure typically results in increased hydration, the effect of hydrostatic pressure on r67 catalytic efficiency will be monitored.  a specific role for substrate assisted catalysis will be probed by modification of the carboxyl groups in the substrate tail. finally, using mutant r67 dhfr genes as well as an in-frame tandem array of four r67 dhfr genes, a directed evolution approach will be taken to select for mutants with increased catalytic efficiency and/or binding specificity.  the results gained will detail catalytic strategies associated with a primitive enzyme as well as provide information on how enzymes evolve.broader impact: this research project will provide undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers with the opportunity to gain a broad background in modern biochemistry and chemistry.  this will readily allow them to secure future positions in biochemistry, chemistry, structural biology, drug design and other related fields.  more specifically, the pi will continue to judge at local scientific venues, including the tn jr. science and humanities symposium and the southern appalachian science and engineering fair; these venues promote science among middle to high school students and feature oral or poster presentation of research.  at the undergraduate level, the pi will continue to involve students in research and include them as coauthors on publications.  the pi has involved minorities in her research program as well as a hearing disabled graduate student.  the pi will maintain her reading of science texts for recording for the blind and dyslexic.  this proven track record will be maintained in the future as well.  further, ut knoxville does a good job of minority student retention, with an overall retention rate of 60%, which is well above the national average of 35%.',\n",

       " 'the design and use of information systems to support the collaborative activity of collocated teams in dynamic, high-risk scenarios remains a challenge. this project will develop novel methods to more efficiently capture and communicate this activity in environments that currently rely on human observation, verbal communication, and collective memory. more efficient teamwork capture processes will enable both larger-scale collection (which supports retrospective analysis that is critical for improved training and technology design) and contemporaneous collection (which provides real-time feedback to workers to assist in error detection). to achieve these goals, domain-specific knowledge and probabilistic reasoning will be used to identify patterns of work and communication. the representative domain of trauma resuscitation is ideal for this work since the roles and tasks of players are well-defined and the flow of work follows a general schema regardless of the patient?s injuries. because of the complexity of this environment, manual tracking of all activities using video recordings requires repeated review and is very time-consuming even for experienced observers. a computer system will be developed that uses video analysis to determine the location of each player, motion analysis to track their movements, and speech recognition targeted at a limited lexicon to identify their communication. using these inputs, a probabilistic reasoning model will be constructed that correlates data from the environment with a domain-specific model of teamwork. the tagged recording of the resuscitation event will be available in real time during the event as well as post-event for analysis.the scientific importance of this work is in the need to tag these video observations. many forms of videos are of repetitive behaviors, whether in surveillance applications, work situations, or other uses. in all such cases, applying a grammar to the video, and matching actions and sounds to that grammar, has the possibility of greatly simplifying work analysis, which is the critical phase in the development computer support for complex, high-risk human activities.the proposed approach will develop novel algorithms and methods for: (i) person and resource tracking in crowded collaborative environments; (ii) recognition of human activity based on fusion of unreliable data from multimodal sensors and a model of the process being recorded; and (iii) reasoning about human activities at different time scales based on heterogeneous technologies (hidden markov models, bayesian nets, and petri nets) that mutually interact for activity and event detection. moreover, the methods will be developed and evaluated in a clinical environment that currently uses limited information technology.broader impacts. this work will also provide the foundation for implementing decision aids in environments such as trauma resuscitation and related medical domains that lack effective methods for instrumented tracking of teamwork. trauma care is a significant health care crisis and any improvements in resuscitation processes will save lives.',\n",

       " \"base excision repair of dna damage in nucleosomes.abstract: dna damage occurs in all organisms, both spontaneously and as a result of exposure to various environmental insults. oxidative damage to dna, which accounts for most of the naturally occurring instances of dna damage, is repaired via the base excision repair (ber) pathway. the enzymes that carry out ber have been extensively studied using naked dna templates, but there is very little information on how these same enzymes gain access to their substrates in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, where the dna is packaged into chromatin. the fundamental subunit in chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of dna wrapped around a protein core. to elucidate mechanisms by which ber enzymes gain access to damaged dna in chromatin, the pi and his collaborator established a model system in which nucleosomes, with defined dna lesions at pre-determined sites, are assembled in vitro and incubated with selected, purified human or bacterial ber enzymes. this model system will be used first to determine if the efficiency of excision of damaged bases from nucleosomal dna is influenced by the chemical nature of the damage itself or by possible nucleosome-imposed constraints to changes in dna conformation that must occur during ber (e.g., base flipping). second, preliminary studies indicate that certain human ber enzymes are more efficient than the equivalent bacterial enzymes at processing dna damage in nucleosomes. deletion mutants will be used to identify domains within the human enzymes that account for this elevated efficiency. finally, oxidative damage to dna sometimes occurs in clusters, and attempted ber of closely juxtaposed lesions can lead to double-strand dna breaks that may be lethal or mutagenic. model nucleosomes containing dna damage clusters will be used to determine how the packaging of dna in chromatin affects the frequency or pattern of ber-induced, double strand break formation. broader impacts: the research embodied in this project will provide new information on how ber enzymes are recruited to and act on dna damage in chromatin, an important area of inquiry where, at present, very little is known. because such damage must be repaired to ensure the survival of individual organisms and their capacity to propagate from one generation to the next, this information will be relevant to the many scientists who study dna packaging, genome stability, or other metabolic transactions involving dna. results from this research project will be broadly disseminated through the research literature and presentations at national and international meetings. in addition, the pi and his collaborator deposit all data in the uvm biodesktop repository, and this information is posted on the web as soon as the corresponding article is accepted for publication. this project also will enhance the scientific infrastructure at uvm by strengthening the ongoing scientific interactions between the pi, whose lab has expertise in chromatin and dna replication, and dr. susan wallace, whose lab has expertise in ber. finally, this project will provide high quality training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. the multidisciplinary efforts in both laboratory groups encompass biochemical and molecular methods as well as genetic, bioinformatic and crystallographic approaches that collectively provide a stimulating environment for students and postdoctoral trainees. both the pi and his collaborator have solid records of training these individuals. both teach undergraduate and graduate courses in a department that offers two undergraduate majors and provides students in these majors the opportunity to conduct laboratory research. the department's graduate program is among the most highly regarded of the graduate programs in the biological sciences at the university. special attention is paid to cultivating students from underrepresented backgrounds. thus, this project will help strengthen our national scientific infrastructure.\",\n",

       " '0824347pozzothe main goal of electrophoretic separation is to use electric fields to separate proteins out of complex biological mixtures (e.g. serum, saliva or cell lysates).  the proposed work uses the principles of nanoscience to rationally improve reproducibility, resolution, and sensitivity.. it focuses on the structure of the protein-surfactant complex and employs a multi-scale experimental approach based on the fundamentals of colloid and polymer science to decipher the intricate relationship between the nano-structure of protein-surfactant complexes, the mechanism of electrophoretic transport (e.g. reptation) and the effectiveness of the macroscopic separation.light, x-ray and neutron scattering experiments will systematically evaluate the structure of protein complexes that are made from  non traditional  anionic surfactants. these experiments will probe nanometer scale structural transitions occurring in the protein-surfactant complex. the changes are triggered by specific alterations in the hydrophobic moiety of the surfactant (e.g. linear and branched alkyl chains) or through the use of mixed surfactant and co-surfactant formulations. in addition, the structure and conformation of the proteins will be monitored in-situ, using on-line neutron scattering experiments carried out in polymeric gels and with the application of electric fields. this should lead to the development of an accurate physical understanding of the true structural parameters that govern electrophoretic transport.  the long term goal is to extend these studies into other areas, such as the use of nano-structured sieving matrices, so that we can develop a complete understanding of the separation. educationally the results of this work will be incorporated into existing courses to demonstrate the use of surfactants in high-technology applications.  it will immediately impact the research experience of graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups. this will help to increase their participation in stem graduate programs. finally, the proposal will allow the pi to continue serving as a liaison between the nist center for neutron research and faculty and students from under-represented groups. this will increase awareness of these and other valuable resources among groups that have historically been unable to take advantage of their availability.',\n",

       " \"the  physics of the interaction of intense laser light  with plasma when wavelength-scale particles are irradiated is investigated. while the nature of strong field interactions with atoms, molecules, small clusters and planar solids has been studied extensively for many years, how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light?s wavelength is largely unexplored. these interactions are likely to exhibit properties which are quite distinct from the interactions of intense pulses with single atoms and molecules on one hand and large planar solid plasmas on the other. this work fills this gap in strong field physics with careful, well-designed experiments that isolate the effects which are peculiar to wavelength-scale targets. previously, our investigations showed that strong field interactions could be enhanced by an appropriate choice of target particle size. boundary conditions imposed by the particles create mie enhancements in the local laser field and thereby increase the nonlinear response of the interaction. the specific focus of the current work is motivated by an important question that arose from our previous experimental and computation studies: is the nature of collisionless absorption by hot electrons around wavelength-scale plasmas different from collisionless absorption from a simple planar solid? a number of theories have recently surmised that such absorption is different at these scales, dominated by what has been termed multi-pass stochastic heating, in which hot electrons can absorb energy from the laser field by passing back and forth multiple times through the micron-scale plasma. this novel heating mechanism has been suggested as being important in a number of experiments and particle-in-cell simulations but there has as yet been no systematic experimental investigation. the current studies  are designed to address this shortcoming. the experiments are designed to directly measure the electron and ion distributions generated in the collisionless heating process, and, by studying specific scalings in particles of well defined size, ascertain the importance or existence of this stochastic heating mechanism. the studies utilize a 20 tw, high temporal contrast laser at ut, electron and ion energy diagnostics, and a novel electrostatic particle injector as a target. these experiments are complemented by simulations using codes available at ut. the work is done through a unique collaboration between an academic research lab at the university of texas  and at harvey mudd college (hmc), an undergraduate institution.application of these kinds of studies may aid in the development of novel bright, laser-driven x-ray sources for radiography and time resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging of other scientific applications. in addition to these scientific impacts, this collaborative work promises to make a significant and somewhat novel impactin graduate and undergraduate education. in addition to its scientific merit, and support of graduate student research at ut, this research significantly adds to the scope and number of research opportunities available to physics undergraduate students at hmc. this work represents a unique situation in which an undergraduate group is involved directly and in a critical way in larger scale strong field optics research, a field which is otherwise prohibitively resource intensive for undergraduate-level research alone. the pis have an excellent record of working together and meaningfully involving undergraduates in their collaborations. undergraduates have the opportunity to do research at hmc, travel to ut in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community. this collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seeking advanced degrees in science. furthermore the pis will continue to disseminate their work through publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and international conference as they have done actively during the past funding period.funds for this award are provided by the physics division within the nsf's mathematics and physical sciences directorate and the office of fusion energy sciences of the doe within the context of the nsf/doe partnership in basic plasma science and engineering.\",\n",

       " 'abstractsoil organic matter (som) and associated litter represents the largest actively cycling pool of organic carbon (oc) and nitrogen (on). because soil acts as both a sink and a source for carbon, a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the controls on the conversion of litter om to som, and its stability in soil is critical to accurately account for the changing balance between the atmospheric, terrestrial plant, and soil carbon reservoirs. in mid continent and northern north american forests there is an increasing awareness of the effect that detritivore macroinvertebrates, specifically earthworms (ew), have on litter decay dynamics and the associated nature of stabilized som. well-documented effects of earthworm introduction into forests with few or no native ew include the depletion of organic horizons, forest floor litter, loss of soluble nutrients, and mixing of mineral and organic horizons. surprisingly, however, earthworm activity, with its feedbacks to enzymatic activity, microbial community structure, and plant biopolymer alteration, is generally not one of the considerations applied to influences on som stabilization. this proposal seeks to document and quantify how these protective mechanisms interact in natural and experimental systems impacted by different degrees of ew activity. our focus is primarily on identifying how differences in invasive ew activity and feeding habit interact with differences in litter chemical composition, mineralogy, and microbial enzyme activity among locations in the same temperate forest to alter the relative importance of physical, chemical, and biochemical protection mechanisms controlling som stabilization. this interdisciplinary, collaborative proposal presents a series of hypotheses and experiments to test fundamental components of the ew-litter-som dynamics as summarized in the following four questions: 1). do ew promote a different decay path for litter, reflected in its biopolymer, elemental, and isotopic composition, that might impact its biochemical recalcitrance and thus som stabilization? 2). how will the degree of stabilization and the biopolymer character of plant/microbial om incorporated in ew casts be influenced by ew feeding habit, initial litter chemistry, and the microbial and mineral composition of soil? 3) given that earthworms are known to impact soil structure and carbon allocation (i.e. litter translocation and incorporation of their casts with associated stable microstructures into soil) how will the known gradient in earthworm activity and litter chemistry across our field sites impact the specific source, chemistry, and amount of som that is biochemically protected (i.e. refractory biopolymers) and/or physically and chemically protected (i.e. aggregated and mineral associated)? 4) how will forest ecosystems at different levels of earthworm activity differ in the rate at which its soil organic carbon (soc) moves through the terrestrial soil carbon reservoir? this work will employ detailed molecular, isotopic, mineralogical, ecological and microbiological methods to develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes that control soil organic matter storage in a system with a intense gradient in ew activity. to accomplish these tasks we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that includes a molecular and stable isotope biogeochemist, a soil molecular ecologist, a soil mineral-chemist, and an earthworm ecologist whose combined expertise is well suited to investigate the impacts of this ecological change on the stability of som. the intellectual merit of this proposal rests on the importance of these factors for soil carbon cycling, the lack of existing knowledge about these questions, the multidisciplinary perspective we apply, and the qualifications of the pis. additionally, this work has significant potential to benefit the som modeling community, which struggles for physically meaningful analyses that permit modeling of som dynamics. the ew-litter-soil system is particularly relevant today as most identified ew species in this region?s forests are non-native, and it is anticipated that over the next few decades they will expand farther into northern forests driven by rising surface temperatures, and local factors, e.g. soil transport, discarded fishing bait, and land use change. knowledge gained from this study will contribute to the general understanding of major drivers in carbon cycling in eastern deciduous forests of north america. the broader impacts of this work include the enhanced understanding of the role earthworms in driving change in north american forest soil processes and biogeochemical cycles that will be of great significance to both scientists and policy-makers. additionally, the project will educate two ph.d. students and numerous undergraduates, with great potential to attract underrepresented students through purdue?s nsf-funded agep and native american programs, serc?s reu program, and johns hopkins?

       " 'organismal phenotypes are controlled by complex networks that buffer against mutation, environmental noise or error ensuring the proper phenotype is produced. in contrast, most phenotypes vary between individuals of a species allowing for evolution. this includes the plant metabolome that has complex enzymatic interactions and is controlled by intricate signaling interactions but also shows inter-specific variation. one poorly understood mechanism that can allow networks to show extensive phenotypic variation is multi-locus epistasis that simultaneously impacts multiple nodes of a network. epistasis is frequently found in naturally variable systems such as crop yield and human disease susceptibility but the molecular mechanism is rarely identified. this project will use natural variation in the rice and arabidopsis metabolomes as model systems to identify mechanisms by which metabolomic quantitative trait loci form an epistatic network that constrains potential variation present within the metabolome. the project builds on previous studies in the model system arabidopsis thaliana that identified eight naturally variable loci that epistatically interact in a genetic network to control swaths of arabidopsis primary metabolism. specific allele combinations at four of these loci lead to plants with 800% increases in steady state content of metabolites within part of the tca cycle.  specific objectives include cloning the genes underlying these loci and manipulating the homologous genes in rice to test their ability to control primary metabolism in a monocot crop.  in addition, precise measures of epistasis in the arabidopsis and rice metabolomes will be made by analyzing a large recombinant inbred line population in each species. finally the data generated will be used to develop a metabolic network de novo using a logic based algorithm that has identified novel metabolic networks in other metabolomics data. in the future, this knowledge will allow for the development of models that integrate natural variation in plant metabolic networks to potentially predict phenotypic diversity. analysis of natural variation in most organisms focuses on single genes of large effect due to relative ease of identification and modeling. however, this is only one aspect of natural variation and organismal evolution. in contrast, most traits are under complex control including significant epistasis with large phenotypic consequences. this proposal will begin to provide insights into how epistasis and biological networks may control complex traits. understanding complex epistatic interactions will provide insights into other complex traits such as crop yield and human disease that are under epistatic control. the proposed project will provide research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. students will be trained in modern metabolic biochemistry and molecular genetics to prepare them for future careers in industry or academics. the undergraduate students will be highly encouraged and guided to develop and devise their own projects within the frame of this proposal. any publication likely to result from this proposal will likely include at least one undergraduate student as a co-author who was integral in designing and interpreting the experiments. established outreach programs will be used to recruit minority students from local high schools and colleges throughout the usa for summer internships. in addition, the principal investigator will be involved in teaching, both in a university classroom setting and in ongoing outreach efforts to educate community members about plant metabolism, quantitative genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and their integration in factorial experiments. all data will be available through the project website and long-term through the arabidopsis information resource (tair: www.arabidopsis.org) and gramene (www.gramene.org).',\n",
       " 'cbet-0852790laugathis grant addresses the locomotion of swimming microorganisms near deformable and rigid interfaces.  most microorganisms spend much of their lives near interfaces such as soft biological surfaces (e.g. blood vessels, muscle tissue and the epithelium), rigid boundaries, and air-water interfaces.  these surfaces may be characterized by complex topography, malleability and complex physicochemical characteristics. in addition to impacting the hydrodynamic stresses encountered by a swimming cell, these boundaries may affect the local concentration of chemical species including nutrients, oxygen levels and ph, consequently modifying the behavior of neighboring organisms. the research addresses a number of unsolved scientific problems through a combination of asymptotic analysis, numerical computations and experiments. despite its prevalence and importance in a variety of ecosystems and medical applications, the dynamics of self-propelled microorganisms near boundaries remains largely unexplored. the investigators address a number of fundamental questions regarding the physical interactions between swimming cells and their environment. the required interdisciplinary work lies at the frontier of engineering, mathematical sciences and biology and combines theory, experiment and computation: this is a realm where the fundamental problems addressed herein are closely related to many natural phenomena and technological applications. small scale locomotion at interfaces has important implications in microbiological applications including control and understanding of surface-associated infections (e.g. the most common hospital-acquired infection, catheter-associated bacteriuria), biofilm formation, and biodegradation (e.g. using bacteria at polluted sites to metabolize undesirable compounds). knowledge gained through this research has the potential to impact biomedical applications and environmental technologies. for example, bacteria in biofims are more difficult to treat with antibiotics costing the u.s. billions of dollars every year in equipment damage, product contamination and medical infections. the societal benefits associated with the ability to understand and eventually suppress this type of film formation are significant. educational impact includes the development of a new graduate-level course on biolocomotion, jointly taught by all three investigators, and the interdisciplinary training of graduate students jointly supervised by faculty in the departments of mathematics and mechanical engineering.',\n",

       " \"in the inflation scenario of how the early universe evolved,  the  universe undergoes a period of accelerated expansion which ensures that the present universe is homogenous and isotropic on large scales, and lays down the primordial perturbation spectrum that sources the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (cmb), and the formation of galaxies (and their associated large scale structure in the universe). eternal inflation arises when the inflationary growth does not end globally, but only in a sub-regions or pockets of the overall spacetime. in this case, one typically has an infinite number of pockets, each of which effectively comprises the entire 'visible universe' of any observer that live inside a pocket. many well-known models of inflation predict that inflation is eternal, but this possibility has usually been regarded as on the fringe of philosophy, since any given observer is unable to see anything outside their own pocket, and the eternal nature of inflation thus does not seem to have an immediately observable consequences.  this proposal challenges that view and gives arguments that one can find direct experimental consequences of eternal inflation.  the key component of this proposal is that one should study the collisions between different pockets shortly after their formation, which would generically lead to anisotropies visible from inside a single pocket. since they are not generically expected in inflationary scenarios, these anisotropies would allow one to define specific signatures of eternal inflation that could then be compared to observational data.  specifically the pi proposes to study  the detailed outcome of a generic bubble collision using  exact solutions to einstein?s equations. the then intends to do a linear analysis of the effect of perturbations on the bubble wall, and finally he intends to perform   numerical simulations of bubble collisions, initially in fixed minkowski and de sitter backgrounds, then in full general relativity. the pi will attempt to connect these results to, on the one hand, our observed cmb sky, and, on the other hand, the underlying picture of eternal inflation with many minima. the proposed research will greatly increase the understanding of open inflation and bubble collisions, which are of great current relevance in inflationary cosmology; further, it may well suggest other avenues of observationally testing both eternal inflation and the string landscape. the pi will be involved in several outreach efforts including public talks, presentations and programs as part of the scipp/ucsc physics outreach program, and outreach online through blogging and other activities\",\n",
       " \"in this project, the pis will study how changes in deep ocean circulation influenced the distribution of heat, nutrients, and carbon within the ocean, and their link to earth's climate and levels of co2 in the atmosphere. the research will test the hypothesis that the northward flow of antarctic intermediate water (aaiw) in the atlantic ocean is linked to its role as a supplier of north atlantic deep water (nadw), which derives from sinking of surface waters at high northern latitudes and then flows southward in the atlantic. the pis predict that when nadw fills more of the deep atlantic, aaiw penetrates farther northward to supply nadw.  in contrast, during abrupt cold events when the formation of nadw was disrupted, the northward penetration of aaiw would have decreased. to address this hypothesis, the pis will collect new sediment cores from the western tropical atlantic (~8 n) using the new rv knorr long coring system.  stable isotope and mg/ca data from fossil foraminifera will be used to generate time series of water mass tracers from depths spanning all subsurface water masses, including aaiw and nadw. better knowledge of the history of the distribution of these water masses will provide a clearer understanding of how deep ocean circulation changes influence climate and atmospheric co2.  the broader impact of this research includes the participation of four graduate and one undergraduate students on the cruise. one graduate student will use the new material for thesis research while an undergraduate will develop a website focusing on the cruise and its scientific significance. data obtained from this project will be archived with the ngdc website and will be included in historical reconstructions used to improve simulations of past ocean circulation and to test the suitability of general circulation models to predict future climate change.  the sediment will be available to other investigators.\",\n",

       " 'intellectual merit of the project: access to genetic information embedded within the genome is essential for the proper development of all eukaryotic organisms from simple yeast to vertebrate animals; thus, it is of great importance to understand the cellular processes that guide proper gene regulation in vivo. several key steps involved in gene regulation require chromatin remodeling, defined as the alteration of dna-histone contacts that comprise the basic building blocks of the genome. recent advances have revealed that chromatin remodeling  complexes  that include multiple proteins are essential cofactors in initiating transcription on chromosomal templates during development, as well as the regulation of alternative splicing and epigenetic control of gene expression. although considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the biochemical mechanism of chromatin remodeling, fundamental questions remain as to how chromatin remodeling complexes are targeted to certain genes in vivo and how they contribute mechanistically to both transcription activation and repression. this project explores the role of the drosophila brahma (swi/snf) chromatin remodeling complex in coordinating hormone signaling with gene regulation at developmentally appropriate time points through effects on transcript elongation by rna polymerase ii--an exciting and unexpected role only recently discovered. the drosophila snr1 and brm proteins are core components of the brahma complex, which is highly conserved among all eukaryotes. this project uses unique genetic and biochemical tools in both fruitflies and cultured cell systems to unravel the functional relationships among complex components, including the atpase subunit brm and the critical regulatory subunit, snr1. these analyses will help to define the mechanisms of in vivo target gene selection and regulation by chromatin remodeling complexes. the relationships between the brahma complex and nuclear receptor coactivators that direct the hormone response pathway are also the focus of this investigation. while coactivator complexes have been identified in both insects and vertebrates and there are strong links between chromatin remodeling and coactivator function, the biological roles of individual components are poorly understood. this project focuses on a biological analysis of the cmi gene, encoding a conserved homolog of the n-terminal portion of the mammalian alr1/mll2 protein found as a component of several nuclear receptor coactivator complexes. through the deployment of recently generated genetic tools this project will enable an unprecedented dissection of the normal functions of cmi. these analyses will provide an important model system to help understand coactivator functions in metazoan development and the relationship with chromatin remodeling. these studies using drosophila as a genetic model system will provide greater understanding of the basic mechanisms by which chromatin remodeling complexes participate in programming gene expression during development, as the regulatory systems in flies and vertebrates are remarkably similar, including transcription control and nuclear receptor function. thus, the results of this project should provide important insights to help biologists better understand chromatin remodeling functions as well as the regulation of rna polymerase elongation in diverse systems.broader impact of the project.  graduate (both ms and phd), undergraduate and several high school students directly participate in the research projects and are trained by the pi and senior personnel. women and minorities are highly represented. multidisciplinary training is a vital aspect of education to prepare students for diverse science careers and this project takes full advantage of the unique tools currently available for drosophila research. students are trained in molecular and developmental genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology and bioinformatics/structural biology. student research (both graduate and undergraduate) is frequently included in publications. students are encouraged to present their work at local, regional and national meetings and to collaborate with expert investigators outside the institution to enhance their training experience.',\n",

       " \"dusty (complex) plasmas are four-component plasma systems that consist of ions, electrons, neutral particles, and the addition of a fourth species, charged microscopic particles or  dust . the charged dust, which is typically composed of micron- or nanometer-sized particles, fully interacts and self-consistently modifies the properties of the surrounding plasma. once primarily focused on astrophysical phenomena such as planetary rings or interstellar dust, the growth of laboratory studies of the role of charged microparticles in plasmas has offered a unique opportunity to observe plasma physics phenomena at the kinetic level. as a result, this field has become, over the last two decades, a robust scientific enterprise within the larger field of plasma science.in laboratory studies, the microparticles become charged through the collection of ions and electrons from the background plasma. this process alters the ion and electron distributions in the plasma. furthermore, in the presence of flows in the plasma, particularly ion flows, not only are the charging conditions of the microparticles modified, but the flows alter the force balance that allows the microparticles to remain suspended in the plasma and provide a free energy source for heating the microparticles and driving instabilities. thus, a continuing challenge to the understanding of dusty plasmas remains the interaction between the charged microparticles and the ions. however, a complete model of this ion drag force remainselusive and an essential piece of information for resolving the differences among the models  the ion drift velocity  is often difficult to obtain in many experiments.most studies of ion-dust interactions infer the ion flow either from collected currents on probes or by the response of the dust particles to an applied perturbation. in this investigation, the pi proposes to directly and independently measure both the ion flow and the dust response to determine the correlation between these two parameters. to accomplish this, the pi?s group will utilize its unique capabilities for optical measurements of microparticle velocities using two-dimensional and stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry (piv). piv facilitates measurements of microparticle transport and the velocityspace distribution function of the microparticle component of the plasma. furthermore, through a collaboration with prof. earl scime's group at west virginia university and access to the auburn fusion laboratory's dye laser system, the pi proposes to use laser induced fluorescence (lif) to directlymeasure ion flow velocities in the plasma. additionally, complementary studies using prof. robert merlino's dusty plasma device at the university of iowa will allow a verification of the measurements performed at the pi's laboratory at auburn university.consequently, this proposed work offers a unique opportunity to address a number of outstanding questions of importance to the dusty plasma community. specifically, this project will investigate two specific aspects of ion-dust interactions: (a) testing a proposed model of dusty plasma heating thatoccurs via an ion-dust two-stream instability; and (b) characterizing how ion flow acts as a trigger for the generation of dust acoustic waves.this proposed research project has several opportunities to have a broader impact. the pi will continue to actively engage undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral scholars in hands-on research training. the pi has a successful track-record of student training and will continue encourageand include student participation in publications, national and international conferences, and laboratory outreach activities. additionally, this work will support collaborative activities among different researchers within the dusty plasma community (e.g., at auburn and iowa) and establish a newpartnership (with wvu), thereby strengthening the community of researchers involved in basic plasma science. furthermore, this project will provide continuing support for many of the public outreach activities that have been undertaken by the pi's laboratory to illuminate the physics of plasmas and dusty plasmas.funds for this award are provided by the physics division and the office of multi-disciplinary activities within the nsf's mathematics and physical sciences directorate, combustion, fire, and plasma systems within nsf's engineering directorate, and the office of fusion energy sciences of the doe within the context of the nsf/doe partnership in basic plasma science and engineering.\",\n",

       " 'it has been widely assumed that ancient settlement in the arabian desert corresponds with periods of increased precipitation. recent archaeological discoveries, however, contradict this assumption.  work by the dubai department of archeology has revealed that significant human settlement took place after the holocene climatic optimum (6000 - 4200 bc) in the rub? al-khali desert in the united arab emirates (uae). this suggests that either the history of settlement or the reconstructed sequence of environmental change in the arabian desert is not entirely understood. under the supervision of dr. jesse casana, jason herrmann will seek to address these issues through coordinated archaeological and paleoenvironmental investigations with the objective of establishing separate chronologies of human settlement and of landscape change that can be used to assess the relationship between available precipitation and desert settlement in southeast arabia. investigations will focus on three archaeological sites in dubai, uae: a large arabian neolithic site (dds-4/8), a third millennium bc site featuring a substantial midden and exposed hearths (al-ashoosh), and a very large metal processing site from the first millennium bc (saruq al-hadid). archaeological investigations will consist of surface survey, geophysical mapping, test excavations, and various dating methods at the three archaeological sites, with the goal of developing chronologies of occupation at each site and determining the continuity or discontinuity of desert settlement in the region. parallel paleoenvironmental investigations will include near-surface geophysics and direct dating of wind-blown sediments in surrounding dunes to serve as a proxy for aridity, thereby providing a history of landscape change. these two independent chronologies will then be compared to assess whether there is a linear correlation between climate change and settlement patterns. synchronized cycles of aridity and periods of abandonment would support the assumption that the desert was only occupied during relatively moist periods. anything other than coordinated cycles of settlement and environmental change would suggest that more complex relationships between settlement patterns and environmental change are at work. the results of this research could advance our understanding of the settlement and environmental histories in this poorly documented region and will offer valuable insight into ancient settlement and land use in arid environments worldwide.more broadly, this project will promote the creation of educational opportunities, the dissemination of information to the public, and the preservation of archaeological sites in the uae. as part of the dubai desert survey, a collaborative effort by american researchers and the dubai department of archaeology, this project will provide fieldwork opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the university of arkansas and the uae. results of this project will be featured in exhibits and educational literature at the jumeirah archaeological museum in dubai and will influence government-sponsored public interpretation and management efforts at the study sites. finally, the project will help protect threatened archaeological sites in dubai. as the city of dubai continues to grow at an unprecedented pace, construction is expanding into previously uninhabited desert regions, threatening undiscovered archaeological remains in a country where there are few procedures for protection of cultural resources.',\n",

       " \"exposure to excessive heat is a significant threat to human health and well-being in cities around the world. urbanization is strongly linked to increasing temperatures through the formation of  heat islands  -  places with higher temperatures due to radiant heat from buildings, concrete, and other human activities. such local effects are likely to intensify with future trends in global warming. previous studies have shown that the urban poor are most vulnerable to extreme heat, but little is known about the interplay between changing urban climates and the coupled human-natural systems that amplify or mitigate climate-related hazards for different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups at finer spatial scales of neighborhoods and households. taking account of global trends in urban growth and climate change, this project investigates the causes of variation in heat-related human vulnerability within the metropolitan region of phoenix, arizona. an ideal laboratory for this research, phoenix has a naturally hot, arid climate. rapid urbanization has increased average summer nighttime temperature by five degrees celsius during the past 50 years. the research will explain the character of complex urban heat  riskscapes , assess the vulnerability of people in different neighborhoods to heat-related health hazards, and identify the causes of variation of vulnerability within cities. ecological, meteorological, sociological, and medical treatment data will be used to build an integrated system dynamics model of vulnerability to climate change that incorporates substantial feedback mechanisms from human adaptations. researchers will use the model to test hypotheses about complex interactions between human manipulation of the environment and induced climate response, to explore relationships between neighborhood and regional dynamics, and to forecast alternative future scenarios. the results will be used to devise alternative neighborhood landscapes and community coping mechanisms that can reduce vulnerability, and to design programs for teaching and learning about climate and health. innovative methodological techniques used in this study are developing fine-scale, surface energy balance models for integrating and extending climate research over spatial and temporal scales; combining airborne and satellite remotely sensed data with a meteorological model nested in state-of-the-art global climate model output; conducting spatial analyses of heat riskscapes and heat-related illnesses; and community-participatory research on coping strategies in low-income and minority neighborhoods.meeting the challenges of sustainability in a rapidly urbanizing and warming world will depend on decisions that allow humans to control or adapt to rising urban temperatures. this project will identify community and demographic markers of high-risk environments that decision-makers can use to develop spatially informed early warning systems and heat-illness prevention programs. model projections for the distribution of future heat-related vulnerabilities and human responses that impact particular places and population subgroups are important for cities on several continents because enlarging heat islands, higher temperatures, and associated adverse impacts on health are occurring globally. model results will be displayed in a visualization environment that will allow stakeholders to examine alternative future vulnerability scenarios; this will make knowledge accessible to the community and promote better decision-making. educational activities will be designed for low-income and minority populations, including the production of a children's magazine issue on  people and climate  that will reach thousands of households. local residents, university students, and project investigators will engage in collaborative community-participation research to promote heat-hazard mitigation in inner-city phoenix neighborhoods. information and materials will be shared with city planners and health agencies in many cities.\",\n",

       " 'low and declining response rates in household surveys provide the potential for nonresponse bias, but assessing the nonresponse bias is a challenging problem when characteristics of nonrespondents are unknown.  for example, for random-digit-dial (rdd) surveys, information about nonrespondents may be limited to just the telephone number.  to address this issue, the census geocoding (cg) method has sometimes been used.  this method appends aggregate census information for small geographic units (for example, census blocks, block groups, or tracts) to nonresponding cases located in those units.  these census data can then be used to evaluate nonresponse bias or adjust for it.  little is known about the effectiveness of the cg approach, but it is often used in nonresponse evaluations, particularly for rdd surveys.  while the cg method is an important tool for recovering information from nonrespondents, it relies on the degree to which its assumptions are met.  this research project will investigate the efficacy of the cg method using rdd and face-to-face survey data and will develop guidelines for implementing it so as to maximize its effectiveness for use in household surveys.  one of the goals of the proposed project is to investigate the minimum amount of information required to apply the cg approach effectively.  as an example, if only a telephone number is known, census aggregate data closer to the telephone exchange-level must be used rather than at the block-level.  finding a method that can be used effectively to evaluate and correct for nonresponse bias in household surveys will be an important contribution to survey research.much of social science relies on probability-based surveys, which in turn rely on the ability to obtain survey measures from all sample members.  nonresponse threatens probability-based inference.  this project will advance the knowledge about methods for evaluating and adjusting for nonresponse bias in surveys.  the project will not only evaluate the cg method for use in telephone surveys but for virtually any survey where the cg method can be used.  this includes any survey where information on nonrespondents is limited to an address, zip code, or telephone number and very little else.  many household surveys use address frames where all that is known for a frame unit is the household family name, the address and, in some cases, a telephone number.  the cg approach can be applied in these situations to evaluate the bias due to nonresponse.  the research is supported by the methodology, measurement, and statistics program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.',\n",
       " 'short-, medium- and long-term neural dynamics of conceptual learningthe process of learning concepts is inherently dynamic, with both short-term neural changes as the aspects of the concept are progressively understood, and longer-term consolidation of the material for retrieval at future times. higher forms of learning, such as verbal and mathematical reasoning, can be studied only in humans because they are beyond the known abilities of other species. thus, non-invasive brain research technologies that provide both high-temporal and high-spatial resolution are required. the proposal represents an emerging domain in the neuroscience of learning, based on a recent development that enables the methodology of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to reveal the full range of the neural dynamics of conceptual learning in the human brain. until now, fmri has been a tool that could only study long-term neural changes because its response is based on the slow temporal dynamics of the cerebral blood response. as a result, it has been impossible to follow the temporal evolution of the learning process through the complex of local cortical activations in the human brain. an innovative approach will be taken to the analysis of neural dynamics to study the neural information flow in the brain during the learning of both verbal and mathematical reasoning tasks to determine how these two kinds of learning take place. in addition, a much higher spatial resolution of the fmri technique than is usual in the study of cognitive processing will focus the study on the analysis of local neural populations. our new technical developments allow us to resolve the neural dynamics of cognitive processing to their native temporal resolution and track the changes in dynamics as the conceptual learning proceeds. this novel approach is of high value in understanding the changes in neural population dynamics underlying the learning process in general, and of the processes of conceptual learning in particular. the current proposal will provide knowledge of the neural dynamics of cognitive processing in the human brain that can have a transformative impact on our understanding of the learning process. in particular, it will radically enhance the ability to build computational models of the neural underpinnings of the learning process, and allow the sequence of information flow in the brain to be mapped as advanced concepts are learned for the first time. this novel capability will promote detailed strategies for enhancing information transfer about effective learning dynamics from the field of cognitive neuroscience to the educational arena.',\n",

       " \"this project investigates a question fundamental to social and economic interactions: can individuals accurately assess the trustworthiness of unfamiliar others and, if so, through what mechanisms? decisions to trust constitute a necessary element for the development of stable partnerships and societies. yet, in the face of the many benefits that come with delayed exchanges, the decision to trust another is often a precarious one.  the individual who first extends effort or provides resources is necessarily in the unenviable position of risking that the other will not reciprocate.  consequently, adaptive functioning relies not only on trusting others, but also on the ability to decide if one's partner is worthy of trust. interestingly, however, previous efforts designed to uncover the signals of trustworthiness have been relatively unsuccessful.  building off initial research by members of the project team which demonstrates that trustworthiness of new partners can be discerned at greater than chance levels, the current project explores a novel route by which  individuals may assesses the intentions of potential partners.  rather than looking for specific cues to trustworthiness in isolation, the process of assessing trust will be reconceptualized as a dynamic and iterative one.  in short, the project will examine whether decisions to trust are not based simply on reading the cues of others, but rather on a dynamic  dance  whereby partners engage in nonconscious mimicry, and in so doing, are able to use perceptions of their own bodily states to infer their partner's feelings and, thereby, predict their motivations. to investigate this possibility, the research team will conduct experiments examining the interplay of emitted nonverbal signals and mimicry on decisions to trust within the context of behavioral economic games. moreover, given that many facets of these phenomena often occur outside of human awareness and control, newly developed social robots will be used as interaction partners for humans in several experiments. these robots provide not only exacting control over relevant expressive parameters that is not possible in humans, but also the opportunity to test proposed models by allowing the robot to predict the trustworthiness of human partners.  taken as a whole, this project not only holds potential to increase understanding of the processes the underlie the initial emergence of trust-based relationships, but also to refine the physical and computational architecture that enable robots to infer motives and predict actions of humans and, thereby, increase their utility and value as interaction partners.\",\n",

       " 'garlic mustard (alliaria petiolata) is an aggressive invasive plant of temperate forests, and constitutes the single greatest threat to forest health throughout much of the northern us.  garlic mustard produces chemicals within its tissues that are toxic to insects that would normally consume forest plants.  this plant has also been found to be toxic to soil bacteria and fungi normally responsible for making nutrients available to other plants.  the goal of the study is to examine a particularly aggressive garlic mustard infestation in pine plantations located in sand ridge state forest (il). the objectives are to identify changes that garlic mustard makes to soil organisms, as well as soil nutrient availability to other plants.  should garlic mustard result in decreases in soil nutrient availability in forest soils, forest productivity could decrease, which would in turn alter harvestable biomass and the amount of carbon that could be stored in forests.  the researchers will investigate changes in soil chemistry and microbial communities in response to garlic mustard invasion across a range of forest sites using a combination of lab and field studies including: experimental site manipulations (e.g., additions of garlic mustard or nitrogen); site and experimental plot characterization of general soil chemistry (ph, c, n, cations, p) and microorganisms (biomass, diversity, enzyme activities).  these analyses should provide information as to whether garlic mustard alters forest health and suggest changes that will occur to stands as this invasive plant moves into new areas. as garlic mustard is currently invading forests at high rates, infestations that result in reduced nutrient availability in north american forests can lead to serious long-term consequences for forest health.  the long-term goal of this project will be to evaluate the impacts of garlic mustard across a broad range of forest soils, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which garlic mustard invades and subsequently acts as an ecological change agent in these forests. all research on this project to date has been a collaborative effort involving bradley university undergraduate students during the academic year, expanding to include local community college students, local high school students and k-12 educators during the summer, including large numbers of women and members of underrepresented groups in science.  funds acquired through this grant will support continued collaborations among these groups.',\n",
       " 'global climate is predicted to change dramatically in the 21st century with warmer temperatures and more extreme climate events expected over most land areas. the consequences of these changes may include shifts in the geographical range of animal and plant species, including many species of trees.  models developed to predict plant and animal response to climate change often do not consider the importance of genetic variation within members of a species or the interactions of that species with other organisms, which could slow or hasten distribution shifts.  this study tests the hypothesis that the ultimate effect of climate change on a tree species and its associated community will result from the interplay between the responses of different tree genotypes to both climate stresses and to the herbivores, competitors and mutualists with which the trees interact.  specifically, this research examines the influence of genetic variation in resistance and susceptibility to insect herbivory on tree responses to drought as mediated by interactions with shrubs that compete with trees for water and soil fungi that enhance uptake of soil resources.  the project involves population genetic analysis, and field, common garden and greenhouse studies of pinyon pine (pinus edulis), a widespread tree particularly sensitive to climate change.  the broader impacts of this project include student training with an emphasis on recruitment of underrepresented minorities, student exchanges between mexican and us institutions, education of prisoners through the arizona department of corrections and outreach to managers whose lands are dominated by pinyon pine suffering high mortality.',\n",

       " \"this project investigates a question fundamental to social and economic interactions: can individuals accurately assess the trustworthiness of unfamiliar others and, if so, through what mechanisms? decisions to trust constitute a necessary element for the development of stable partnerships and societies. yet, in the face of the many benefits that come with delayed exchanges, the decision to trust another is often a precarious one. the individual who first extends effort or provides resources is necessarily in the unenviable position of risking that the other will not reciprocate. consequently, adaptive functioning relies not only on trusting others, but also on the ability to decide if one's partner is worthy of trust. interestingly, however, previous efforts designed to uncover the signals of trustworthiness have been relatively unsuccessful. building off initial research by members of the project team which demonstrates that trustworthiness of new partners can be discerned at greater than chance levels, the current project explores a novel route by which individuals may assesses the intentions of potential partners. rather than looking for specific cues to trustworthiness in isolation, the process of assessing trust will be reconceptualized as a dynamic and iterative one. in short, the project will examine whether decisions to trust are not based simply on reading the cues of others, but rather on a dynamic  dance  whereby partners engage in nonconscious mimicry, and in so doing, are able to use perceptions of their own bodily states to infer their partner's feelings and, thereby, predict their motivations. to investigate this possibility, the research team will conduct experiments examining the interplay of emitted nonverbal signals and mimicry on decisions to trust within the context of behavioral economic games. moreover, given that many facets of these phenomena often occur outside of human awareness and control, newly developed social robots will be used as interaction partners for humans in several experiments. these robots provide not only exacting control over relevant expressive parameters that is not possible in humans, but also the opportunity to test proposed models by allowing the robot to predict the trustworthiness of human partners. taken as a whole, this project not only holds potential to increase understanding of the processes the underlie the initial emergence of trust-based relationships, but also to refine the physical and computational architecture that enable robots to infer motives and predict actions of humans and, thereby, increase their utility and value as interaction partners.\",\n",
       " 'this symposium at the society for integrative and comparative biology (sicb) focuses on how animals coordinate reproduction with a changing environment. recently, significant advances have been made in unraveling the physiological and molecular mechanisms that form the basis of the reproductive machinery in mammals and birds. further, new studies in evolutionary ecology are pinpointing the reproductive phenotypes on which selection acts to produce individuals that breed at optimal times of year in different habitats. the goal of the symposium is to meld these two fields, reproductive physiology /environmental endocrinology on the one hand, and evolutionary ecology on the other, so as to enhance progress in our understanding of the evolution of reproductive mechanisms. this symposium will unite at one venue international experts working on reproductive physiology and molecular endocrinology together with those working in evolutionary ecology and life history to integrate these historically separate fields. it will also serve to unite researchers working on diverse vertebrate taxa, which will stimulate exchange of ideas across taxonomic groups that often are approached in quite different ways. consequently, the symposium will facilitate progress in the field of integrative biology generally, and will specifically enhance our understanding of both basic (e.g., evolutionary) and applied (e.g., conservation) implications of the mechanisms by which animals adjust their annual cycles to variable environmental conditions. sicb is heavily student-oriented, and the annual meeting is attended by many graduate students, undergraduates, and even some high school students. the meeting is also attended by representatives of the media, and the society provides press releases regarding presentations of significance to the general public. the content of this symposium has particular import for understanding how animal populations are likely to be affected by human-induced environment modification, a topic of ever-increasing general public interest, and will consequently provide rich opportunities for communicating with the general public about how basic science furthers applied goals. the list of presenters includes several young investigators and women, as well as a balanced complement of domestic and international researchers.',\n",
       " 'intellectual merit: heme is the most abundant source of circulating iron in mammals.  it is therefore not surprising that many pathogenic bacteria, including the opportunistic pseudomonas aeruginosa, avidly pursue its capture and internalization in order to overcome the very low free-iron concentrations encountered in their mammalian hosts.  to capture heme, several pathogenic bacteria, including p. aeruginosa, deploy a heme acquisition system (has), which consists of a protein secreted to the extracellular space (hasap) and an outer membrane receptor (hasr).  hasap is also termed a hemophore because it efficiently captures hemoglobin-heme and delivers it to the receptor for subsequent internalization.  the project aims to achieve fundamental molecular level understanding of the protein-protein interactions that allow hasap to  steal  heme from human hemoglobin.  in particular, the investigators seek to gain structural, dynamic and mechanistic insights into the factors that determine the transfer of heme from human hemoglobin to hasap.  this long-range goal will be reached by pursuing three main objectives: 1) elucidate the three dimensional structure of apo-hasap, 2) identify the binding interface of the encounter complex that forms when hasap binds to hemoglobin, prior to heme transfer, and decipher the role played by the gross reorganization of hasap structural elements in the molecular recognition and binding to hemoglobin, and 3) characterize the changes in coordination and spin state experienced by the heme-iron in the early stages of heme transfer from hemoglobin to hasap.  the moënne-loccoz and rivera laboratories have joined forces to meet the interdisciplinary demands of the proposed activities.  the rivera lab will conduct the nmr spectroscopic studies aimed at solving the structure of hasap devoid of heme, map the interface of the complex and study the dynamical properties of hasap in the encounter complex. the moënne-loccoz lab will carry out the rapid-mix-quench experiments coupled to uv-vis, epr and resonance raman necessary to delineate the fate of the hemoglobin-heme as it is captured by hasap.  broader impacts: in addition to providing molecular insight into the manner by which p. aeruginosa captures heme from hemoglobin to overcome the low iron concentrations in a mammalian host, the fundamental knowledge derived from these investigations may pave the way for the future design of inhibitors to the interactions between hemoglobin and hasap. the multidisciplinary nature of the project will provide opportunities for students at all academic levels.  video-conference calls and yearly visits from the moënne-loccoz and rivera labs will expose the students to the intellectually diverse atmosphere that is necessary to nurture multidisciplinary research.  the ethnically rich environment present in both groups will prepare students for the multifaceted work environment they are likely to encounter after graduation.  the collaborative spirit of this project will illustrate the benefits of a broad-based approach for (1) solving complex problems, (2) effectively interpreting results obtained in one laboratory within a global context; and thus (3) maximizing the impact on this research on the greater scientific community and the general public.',\n",

       " \"a central form of human knowledge is generic knowledge, that is, general information about categories, from animals to numbers, from celestial objects to machines, from economic systems to social systems.  human progress is marked by a search for understanding principles that apply broadly across varying instances within a category.  a fundamental means of expressing general knowledge to children is via language, and in particular generic noun phrases (e.g.,  insects are 6-legged ).  prior work has demonstrated that generic noun phrases are frequent in parental speech to children, used in diverse cultural and linguistic contexts (u.s., china, peru), produced by children exposed to minimal linguistic input (deaf children not exposed to sign language), understood appropriately by preschool-aged children, and stored by children in long-term memory.  these component pieces all suggest that generics are important, meaningful, acquired early, and have the potential to influence children's world knowledge.  however, prior work on generics leaves two major questions unanswered:  (1) does generic language affect and guide children's concepts, or does generic language merely reflect children's concepts?  (2) what is the process by which generic language is acquired in childhood?  the project will investigate both these core issues.  an in-depth training study will teach young children a new concept under varied wording conditions to chart the effects of generics and labeling on children's categorical reasoning.  furthermore, a set of experiments will test competing claims regarding the process by which generics are learned.  these studies will make use of experimental research and naturalistic language analyses to provide converging and precise evidence regarding the links among concepts and language in children between 2 and 5 years of age.the project will promote more effective learning strategies by providing much-needed information on how the language that parents and teachers use (generic vs. specific) affects how children acquire and generalize new information.  these findings will help us understand better how children learn language, and have implications for science education.  furthermore, understanding how and when children form generalizations within categories informs the development of stereotyping, as well as how children come to understand human diversity.  finally, the work will benefit society at large, by providing scientists, educators, and parents with an understanding of children's early cognitive processes and the effects of language on such processes.  understanding how these basic processes unfold in normally developing children also provides a framework for eventually understanding how they can go awry, for example, in children with specific language impairment.\",\n",
       " \"recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics are confronting individuals of all ages with a series of category-defying entities that combine features of living and nonliving things. as such, these entities increasingly challenge people's basic understanding of mind and intelligence. the goal in this project is to explore adults' and children's beliefs about a range of living and mechanical agents, and to test how these beliefs affect people's ability to track, remember, and understand mechanical agents in two specific computer interfaces.  first, it will explore a computer interface designed to allow a human operator to interact with and control a set of semi-autonomous robots.  the second environment will be a teachable agent system in which middle school children learn about complex science phenomena, such as river ecosystems, by actively teaching an animated software agent.this project represents one of the few research programs to empirically test people's understanding of living and artificial agents, and it will employ a conceptual framework that starts with naïve understandings of mind (e.g.  theory of mind ) and applies them to engineered environments where these understandings are used. this framework describes the conditions under which participants apply different agent concepts, and can help understand how these beliefs might change over time as people interact with novel agents. although the framework is not yet a complete theory, it represents a broadened approach to reasoning about both typical and novel living and mechanical agents that goes beyond existing dual-process models of theory of mind. these experiments also make links between concepts about agents, and the deployment of these concepts in realistic high-load perceptual tasks, so they can make an important contribution to our basic understanding of how knowledge affects vision.the findings from this project may have important implications for educating both children and adults to deal with novel intelligent decision making technologies that move beyond the simple command-and-response cycle inherent to most current computer applications. previous research by the pis has already documented ways in which different people vary in their approach to these technologies (e.g. older and younger adults seem to have subtly different beliefs about the nature of computer intelligence), so this project may help improve the accessibility of novel agent-technologies to a wide range of different populations. more generally, because this research uses interactive educational tools and realistic robot-command systems to explore agent-understanding, it has the potential to improve user interfaces supporting social learning environments that focus on self-regulated learning, and that facilitate the effectiveness of human-machine emergency response teams. these technologies confront users with challenges to their most basic understandings of intelligence and thinking, and our research has the potential to guide both children and adults as they become successful users and creators of the interactive technologies of the future.\",\n",

       " \"transposable genetic elements (tes) are of virtually universal occurrence in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and in multicellular eukaryotes have been found to constitute a substantial portion of the genome: nearly one-half in humans, and even more in many plants. their existence raises fundamental questions related to eukaryotic genome structure, function, and evolution. this project is based on the view that much can be learned about tes and their effects on genome structure by comparing their characteristics and evolution in sexual taxa with those in asexual taxa. because of the important role of sexual reproduction in both the maintenance and limitation of deleterious tes in eukaryotic populations, the putative asexuality and other highly unusual characteristics of bdelloid rotifers, such as the repeated dna breakage and repair thought to occur during the cycles of desiccation and rehydration characteristic of bdelloid habitats, make them a promising model system for investigating fundamental problems associated with tes. these problems include their proliferation, compartmentalization and distribution within genomes, the mechanisms of their copy number control, the dependence of their maintenance, dynamics and evolution on biparental reproduction, their domestication and possible role in the maintenance of chromosome ends, and their participation in horizontal gene flow, whereby tes and other dna may enter bdelloid genomes by means other than vertical descent. indeed, the investigators' studies of bdelloid tes have already revealed notable differences from sexual taxa in the types and genomic distribution of tes and foreign dna in bdelloid genomes, and have suggested novel ideas for the operation and evolution of systems that protect chromosomes and their ends from degradation. the principal objectives of the research are (i) to investigate subtelomeric te-rich clusters in bdelloids in order to determine whether telomeric te copies may constitute part of a genome defense system against invading tes, and to uncover the role  of telomere-associated retroelements in formation and function of these clusters; (ii) to investigate the origin and function of novel reverse transcriptases found in bdelloids and its possible relation to genome defense  mechanisms; (iii) to further examine bdelloid and monogonont genomes for the presence of diverse intact or relict retroelements and telomeric te-rich clusters, and to identify candidate monogonont tes for introduction into bdelloid genomes; and (iv) to continue efforts to achieve stable transformation in order to test for proliferation of tes introduced into internal and telomeric regions. these specific objectives are aimed at characterizing fundamental mechanisms of genome defense in bdelloids and their implications for eukaryotes generally.   the research will be of interest to biologists interested in problems of genome structure and evolution, as well as to the general public. the investigators will continue to discuss their research in the media, as they have done in previous years on programs such as npr's  the connection   and  talk of the nation: science friday.  they will contribute to the activities of mobile genetic element cluster at the marine biological laboratory (mbl) at woods hole, and will participate in convening the annual northeast mobile dna meeting. the project will continue to rely on student involvement, providing undergraduates with hands-on training and with access to the unique summer environment at the mbl, which includes friday lectures by eminent scientists and the possibility to interact with visiting scientists and summer course students from around the world.\",\n",

       " \"this grant supports collaborative research on the language production system, especially how it develops in children. five studies examine fluency and points of sentence planning difficulty by manipulating properties of certain sentence structures. the sentences emphasize relative clauses, exemplified by  who the boy was calling  in the sentence  the girl found the teacher who the boy was calling.  such structures challenge the sentence planning mechanism because the relative clause involves relationships among different elements (teacher and who relate to calling in the example here). this research compares nonfluencies like pauses and restarts across both structural variations and ages of speakers. the comparison across structures evaluates planning units, such as clauses, and what might stress sentence planning, such as distance between related elements. the comparison across speakers evaluates developmental changes in the system that handles such stresses. the experiments use two methods for studying language production. one is an imitation task, where people listen to a story and then imitate a sentence they hear about the story; the other is an elicitation task, where people produce their own sentence to designate a certain character in the story. the combination of methodology and structural emphasis here has the potential to produce outcomes that are transformative for both developmental and mature language production modeling. shedding light on the developing production system helps distinguish the effects of this dynamic system (the real-time act of producing language) from the effects of more static knowledge systems (the internal linguistic principles). this matters across domains of cognitive development, where research often relies on children's speech. children's speech is also central in domains other than language and developmental sciences (e.g., in the court system and in the diagnosis and treatment of various impairments). better understanding of the multiple and interacting influences on normally developing children's speech must eventually apply to such domains. the project also provides research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in maine and arizona, relying heavily on apprenticeship and independent study experiences. this grant includes annual support for student involvement in dissemination activities like professional conference presentations. finally, support for the collaboration directly addresses the infrastructure for research and education in a particular partnership and strengthens the networks associated with this partnership, including students in all such activities.\",\n",

       " 'intellectual merit. the research team will use modern biological tools to understand signal transduction processes of an important plant hormone, abscisic acid (aba), in guard cells. guard cells are highly specialized plant epidermal cells that enclose tiny pores called stomata. stomatal movements (enabled by turgor changes in guard cells) control both co2 uptake for photosynthesis and transpirational water loss, and thus play important roles in plant growth and acclimation to environmental stresses. aba is a key indicator of drought stress. it induces stomatal closure via an intricate intracellular signaling network comprised of proteins and metabolites, thereby promoting plant water conservation. this research will analyze the roles of many proteins, especially those subject to reduction and oxidation (redox) modifications, in guard cell aba signal transduction. dynamic changes in key intracellular metabolites in guard cells upon aba treatment will also be characterized. the project is expected to identify novel redox-regulated proteins and metabolites and put them into functional context of aba signal transduction. the resources from this project will be distributed via a publicly accessible web interface and ftp sites for maximum scientific impact. the project is expected to provide comprehensive knowledge of regulatory mechanisms underlying stomatal movements that will help to develop crops with enhanced drought tolerance and improved productivity. broader impacts. this project will benefit society at large because a better understanding of aba signal transduction will inform rational crop engineering for better agricultural yield and stress tolerance. since protein redox regulation is a ubiquitous biological process, occurring in essentially every organism including plants, animals, and micro-organisms,  the data, techniques and resources developed in the project will be of immediate value to a broad range of scientists and will be disseminated via a web interface and ftp sites, as well as in publications and at scientific conferences. the project will involve cross-disciplinary training of personnel, including high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, in the frontiers of modern biological sciences. given that knowledge of large-scale and high-throughput protein analysis (proteomics) is still not widespread, a proteomics workshop will be offered to graduate students and post-doctorates nationwide. graduate students and post-doctorates from the chen and assmann laboratories will participate in developing and running the workshop, thus gaining valuable experience in teaching outside the standard classroom setting. students from under-represented groups will be recruited for the training opportunities.',\n",

       " 'this project focuses on the development and application of quantitative methods for historical research in political science. the project is motivated by criticisms expressed by prominent scholars in the discipline of history and in the area of american political development within political science. one of their core concerns is that the way quantitative methods are currently employed by political scientists pays inadequate attention to issues of temporality, periodicity, specificity, and context. the pis argue that these concerns can be addressed by using methods that allow for parameter variation across the dimension of time, incorporating the richness and complexity of historical analysis while maintaining the rigor necessary for testing causal claims. the project initially focuses on historical research on the u.s. congress, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of the methods that the pis advocate with applications from their own work, and then expands to cover additional institutional and behavioral sites of inquiry.this project pushes existing boundaries of research in history and political science by tackling problems and issues that are central to the conduct of historical work. political scientists are turning more and more to the past to broaden and deepen our understanding of political behavior and institutions, using the additional cases and variation that history has to offer for model building and testing. however, as prominent historians have rightly pointed out, political scientists are not making the most of these opportunities because they frequently treat history simply as data with the implicit assumption of an equivalence among facts and particulars found in various periods and contexts. the methodological approaches that the pis present overcome these problems and advance quantitative research on politics in a way that will broaden its appeal to a wider range of scholars. multilevel models?especially ones that employ priors that incorporate temporal dynamics?enable parameters that indicate relations among variables to vary, and thus can capture the kind of complexity that characterizes the development and evolution of historical processes.this project helps break down barriers between history and political science, enriching work in both disciplines. the project advances an ongoing dialogue about the challenges and pathways for progress in the conduct of historical social science. while not developing new methods from scratch, the project makes significant extensions to existing approaches by applying them in ways that are innovative to political science. by exposing historically-oriented researchers to these methods and making them more accessible, the project contributes new additions to the standard methodological toolkit in political science. although historians are not likely to employ the methods that we advocate, they will be more prone to respect the historical work done in political science and to incorporate the findings of that work into their scholarship.',\n",

       " \"engaging undergraduate students in authentic research in the classroom can enhance development of scientific thinking. however, in a teaching laboratory with 20 or more students, a limiting factor in student success with open-ended research problems is instructor availability for real time, individualized scaffolding (guiding students to higher-level thinking and complex problem solving related to the student's research problem). this project is testing the hypothesis that by moderately scaffolding the student research process a carefully designed web interface tool, the  exploring genomics in context interface  (egci), can support classroom instruction and facilitate authentic research in genomics with only a modicum of faculty input. the egci provides an iterative way for students to choose strategies for asking and addressing biologically interesting questions using a range of genomics tools. it is designed to help students develop the ability to: 1) define biologically interesting questions that can be addressed with data, 2) relate a gene to biological function, 3) analyze data including the aspect of quality, 4) develop a literature-based understanding of important quantitative approaches, and 5) test thoroughly a viable hypothesis by bringing together the literature, classroom knowledge, and analysis of data. the project's specific research objectives are to: 1. determine how undergraduate students' scientific thinking skills are enhanced by an authentic research experience in the context of a course; 2. analyze the role of scaffolding in supporting student research success; and 3. identify generalizable components for computer-based scaffolding of open-ended research.   these are being explored using a mixed-methods research approach to collect data that characterizes: 1) the skill level of individual students prior to the course, developed through the course prior to the specific assignment, and following the assignment, 2) student behavior during the assignment (including structured observations; student reflections; and analysis of egci webmetrics), and 3) the scaffolding accomplished by the faculty member (including structured observations and reflection by the faculty members). intellectual merit: genomics education is an ideal platform on which to initiate this work because genomics, an important frontier in modern science, provides the opportunity for students to work with large datasets; and allows scaffolding of biological questions at multiple levels of organization. chamaecrista (partridge pea) and aiptasia (model for symbiotic corals), the organisms selected for this initial work, are ideal test subjects because they are threatened by global climate change and evolution, are scientifically important, and, most important for an undergraduate project, have readily available gene sequences and appropriate supporting analysis tools. broader impacts: identifying general elements of scaffolding software that support authentic student research at scale increases opportunities for undergraduates at many institutions to develop higher order, scientific thinking skills, meeting a national need. all curricular material, assessment tools, and editable forms of the egci are being made freely available for adoption on the teaching genomics website.  the work is being conducted at two different institutions - one that integrates genomics throughout the curriculum (carleton) and one with distinct genomics and bioinformatics courses (vassar), thus broadening the applicability of the efforts to other institutions.\",\n",

       " \"this research explores the causes and consequences of domestic terrorism and government counter-measures. domestic terrorism refers to home-grown political violence against non-combatants by non-state actors who wish to generate fear in a larger audience in order to achieve political objectives. though domestic terrorism consists of about 91% of all terrorism events (for the period of 1998-2006), few systematic empirical studies of this phenomenon populate the terrorism literature. the core purpose of the project is to evaluate the consequences of government countermeasures on the frequency and lethality of domestic terrorist attacks. the project draws on the contentious politics and transnational terrorism literatures to apply and develop theories about the timing and effects of dissident leaders' different tactical choices (e.g., bombings v. armed attacks) and target selections (e.g., state targets or civilian targets; attack marketplaces or rail stations) over the course of a political struggle. the study then subjects the implied hypotheses to rigorous empirical testing. preliminary findings suggest that empirical data are consistent with the theoretical expectations that certain types of policies impose different costs on dissident movements causing leaders to substitute costly tactics for less costly tactics. this research is the first to systematically examine the frequency and severity of domestic terrorism incidents across multiple countries. it is also the first set of statistical studies to examine the interrelationships among domestic terrorist tactics and an array of other non-terrorist, non-violent, and facilitative tactics. finally, it is the first set of systematic empirical studies to examine the effects of government tactics, policies, and strategies on domestic terrorist tactics and strategies. previous studies mostly concerned themselves with (1) transnational terrorism and/or (2) studied political violence or terrorism, as opposed to both within the same theoretical and empirical framework. those that did study terrorist and non-terrorist acts within the same model ignored that terrorism ? attacking civilians ? might be different than other forms of political violence, like guerrilla ambushes on military personnel. one of the main goals of this research is to analyze whether or not these distinctions can and should be made. are their different causal processes that lead some groups to employ terrorist methods to achieve their goals and others not to use terrorist methods to achieve their goals? until now, previous research on domestic terrorism and political violence has been impeded by a lack of systematic data for empirical testing of propositions about the choice and timing of government and dissident tactics, including terrorist tactics, over the course of a contentious struggle. by collecting information on domestic terrorism, non-terrorism, violent, non-violent, and cooperative events committed by a multiplicity of actors, government countermeasures in 17 south and southeast asian countries, recent data produced from project civil strife (pcs) is able to overcome these limitations. using these data, different models identify trends and variation in different domestic terrorist tactics among an array of other violent (but not terrorist), non-violent, and cooperative tactics.  the statistical models are then used to forecast patterns and trends for different countries in south and southeast asia.   the project makes contributions in both the academic and policy arenas ranging from improved academic understanding of government and dissident leaders' tactical decisions in domestic conflict to informing the efforts of practitioners involved in confronting domestic challenges. at the present time, the academic community has little to offer in the way of practical advice to governments fighting domestic terrorism. this project has implications for how to constrain and limit domestic terrorism around the world and particularly in south and southeast asia.\",\n",

       " \"this project aims to develop and analyze efficient numerical methods for forward problems in the time domain involving the propagation and scattering of electromagnetic waves in complex dielectric media that display physical dispersion due to multiple polarization mechanisms.  the forward solution of dispersive, time-dependent electromagnetic wave systems is often used to obtain safety standards regarding exposure of humans to high-energy electromagnetic fields.  these numerical simulations can also be utilized in an inverse-problem formulation, for example, in cancer detection.  in imaging for medical applications, one seeks to investigate the internal structure of an object (the human body) by means of electromagnetic fields at sub-infrared frequencies to detect and characterize cancer or other anomalies by studying changes in the dielectric properties (such as permittivity, conductivity, relaxation times, etc.) of tissues.  electromagnetic wave propagation in complex dispersive media is governed by the time-dependent maxwell's equations coupled to equations that describe the evolution of the induced macroscopic polarization.  the behavior of the media's macroscopic polarization may include first-order relaxation mechanisms of debye type, used in modeling polar materials such as water and living tissue, as well as second-order mechanisms of lorentz type.  these two mechanisms will be used as model problems.  the investigator and a graduate student will develop operator-splitting techniques along with mixed finite element methods for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive dielectrics.  additionally, fictitious domain methods will be applied to wave-scattering problems in these materials.  efficient absorbing layers for terminating computational boundaries involving dispersive dielectrics will be constructed and analyzed.  analysis of well-posedness, stability, and convergence of the new methods will be conducted.  the graduate student will study existing simulation methods and make comparisons with the newly developed computational techniques.\",\n",
