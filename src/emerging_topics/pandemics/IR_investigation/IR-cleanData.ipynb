       "'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Carotid artery stenosis is a well-known cause of atheroembolic stroke. Stroke prevention in these patients has been the focus of intense investigation. Cognitive impairment is a more insidious but poorly understood outcome in patients with  asymptomatic  carotid stenosis who have not suffered a stroke. Cognitive function describes how a person produces and controls mental processes such as thinking, learning, and problem solving. It is an important outcome measure that affects patient well-being and their ability to live independent productive lies. It is well-known that cognitive impairment coexists in patients with stroke from carotid stenosis. However, isolated cognitive deficits in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have not been looked for, and have therefore not been reported in any detail.  Asymptomatic carotid stenosis affects 2-12% of people. With 23.4 million veterans in the country, at least 1 million (4.3%) have asymptomatic carotid stenosis and are at risk for cognitive impairment. A subset analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Study found cognitive decline in 34% of 32 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In this proposal, we will define the extent of initial and progressive cognitive impairment in veterans with carotid stenosis who are currently labeled as  asymptomatic  in the absence of a focal neurologic deficit (stroke, transient ischemic attack). Programs to prevent, postpone, or mitigate cognitive impairment in patients with carotid stenosis will depend on the identification of mediators for cognitive impairment. Microembolic brain injury and cerebral hypoperfusion have been associated with cognitive impairment in elderly individuals. Therefore plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion are likely mediators of impaired cognition in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. As part of this proposal, we will identify the biological mechanisms by which carotid stenosis could result in cognitive impairment.  The goal of this proposal is to perform a systematic, adequately powered study to measure the magnitude of cognitive impairment in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, its impact on quality of life, and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Information from this study will define an unsuspected morbidity of carotid stenosis and identify subsets of patients at risk for cognitive impairment. It will form the foundation for future studies on prevention, pre-emptive treatment, or rehabilitation of patients with carotid stenosis. It will also improve the selection of patients with carotid stenosis to decrease unnecessary revascularization procedures.  Specific Aim 1 will assess if patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis differ in cognitive function compared to age-matched controls without carotid stenosis but with similar vascular risk profiles. We hypothesize that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis 50% who survive stroke free for 2 years; the change in overall and domain-specific cognitive function will be significantly different compared to those without stenosis. The study will recruit 284 subjects and will detect a clinically significant difference in cognitive score with 90% power. We will use a novel battery of cognitive tests specifically developed to address the unique issues relating to carotid stenosis. Specific Aim 2 will define plaque-morphometric, biologic, and hemodynamic characteristics that correlate with cognitive impairment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We hypothesize that carotid plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum pro-inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion could each mediate cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up period. We will implement a novel clinical 3D B-mode ultrasound imaging technique developed to obtain reliable serial plaque measurements. Specific Aim 3 will measure the impact of cognitive impairment on quality of life. We hypothesize that at 2 years, regardless of plaque features, cognitive impairment will correlate with a reduction in health-related quality of life measures.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Carotid artery plaques are known to cause stroke. Cognitive impairment is an insidious but poorly under- stood problem in patients with carotid plaques. Cognitive function describes how we perform mental processes such as thinking, learning and problem solving. Asymptomatic carotid plaques may affect 1 million veterans who may be at risk for cognitive impairment. In this study, we will uncover the extent of cognitive impairment in veterans with carotid stenosis who are currently labeled  asymptomatic . Programs to prevent or mitigate cog- nitive impairment will depend on identifying the mechanisms by which this occurs. We will use sophisticated 3D imaging techniques developed by our group to measure the structure and composition of plaques, number of particles breaking off from them, blood levels of chemicals that could disrupt them, and blood flow restriction to the brain from them. This will help identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment who may benefit from pre- ventative measures and improve selection of patients to decrease unnecessary surgical procedures.'"

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K22 Award project is designed to support the PI's transition to becoming an independent researcher at an academic institution. The PI has prepared for this research through studies in molecular biology biochemistry, microbiology, and immunology. His most recent work has shown the strong effects of soluble, multimeric CD40L- and GITRL-based molecular adjuvants on HIV DNA vaccines in mice. Using support from this K22 award, the PI would move these molecular adjuvants into adenoviral vaccines against HIV, in order to make these promising vaccines even stronger. To this end, four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) To  prepare adenoviral vectors containing HIV Gag along with novel soluble multimeric CD40L or GITRL. (2) To determine if these molecularly adjuvanted adenoviruses are effective activators of dendritic cells in vitro. (3) To determine if these TNFSF-adjuvanted adenoviral vaccines induce stronger, broader, and longer-lasting responses than do their unadjuvanted counterparts. (4) To determine if these TNFSF-adjuvanted adenoviral vaccines are capable of inducing immune responses in mice that have high levels of neutralizing anti-adenoviral antibodies. These studies, when complete, promise to improve adenoviral vaccines that are already being tested in human trials against HIV. In addition, adenoviral vaccines may protect against many other infections, including influenza, SARS, Ebola, and agents of biodefense interest. Thus, this approach toward making stronger vaccines, which is the PI's scientific focus, could lead to better control of infectious diseases and has broad public health significance.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morbidity and mortality from atherosclerosis are associated with complicated atherosclerotic lesions due to plaque rupture and severe hemispheric neurological symptoms. However, a group of atherosclerotic patients remain asymptomatic because of plaque stability. It is not known if and how the stable and unstable plaques are different biochemically, and how the immune system regulates plaque stability. The studies over the past several years in our laboratory suggest that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, and possess strong mitogenic and anti-apoptotic activity for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Furthermore, we have shown that in stable plaques there is increased density of VSMCs and decreased number of macrophages and T-lymphocytes, whereas reverse is true with unstable plaques. We propose the hypothesis that decreased expression and activity of IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) on VSMCs due to cytokines released by proliferating and activated T-lymphocytes (IFN-gamma) and macrophages (IL-12 and IL-18) leads to apoptosis resulting in the instability of atherosclerotic plaques observed in symptomatic patients. To these ends the Specific Aims of this application in the carotid plaque VSMCs of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are: Specific Aim 1: We will examine IGF-l-induced survival of plaque VSMCs of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the presence and absence of human atheroma-associated cytokines (11-12, IL-18 and IFN-gamma) using TUNEL, annexin V labeling, time-lapse videomicroscopy, and caspase 3 activity. For comparison, VSMCs from normal carotid artery will be run in parallel. Specific Aim 2: We will examine the underlying mechanisms of cytokine-induced decrease in IGF-l-induced survival of VSMCs. We will assess the effect of cytokines on IGF-1R and IGFBPs in VSMCs of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. Specific Aim 3: We will investigate the role of FoxO family of forkhead transcription factors, specifically FKHR (FoxO1) and FKHR-L1 (FoxO3), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 and Bim, a pro-apoptotic proteinof Bcl-2 family in IGF-l-induced survival of VSMCs from symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of carotid stenosis and regulatory role of IGF-1 receptors in the stability of plaques will provide opportunities to develop a more precise and cost-effective treatment.',\n",
       " 'Our NIH grant support over the last four years has allowed us to characterize the stress/strain profile of patients referred for aortic valve replacement (AVR) for chronic severe aortic insufficiency (AI), both before and after successful AVR. Their abnormally elevated preoperative left ventricular (LV) end-systolic stress returned to normal after AVR. Although resting systolic strain was normal before surgery, the strain response to dobutamine was blunted - and neither was normal postoperatively - despite the fact that they were referred for surgery early in the course of their disease (minimally or asymptomatic). This suggests that 1) our clinically applicable, MRI-based stress/strain indices are sensitive enough to consistently detect abnormalities even in minimally or asymptomatic AI patients, and 2) our current recommendations for timing of referral for AVR in this patient subset are not adequate to completely recover these sensitive stress/strain indices of ventricular function. Our data at least partially explain the well-recognized, not-infrequent occurrence of progressive LV dysfunction and heart failure after seemingly successful AVR for chronic AI. We propose to further define the early stages of the natural history of chronic AI by applying our stress/strain indices to asymptomatic patients who are being followed on medical therapy early in the course of their chronic AI. MRI-based, three-dimensional left ventricular geometrical data sets will be combined with clinically-acquired systolic ventricular loading conditions and advanced finite element modeling techniques to construct and utilize accurate, patient-specific, systolic mathematical models of the heart. We propose to characterize left ventricular systolic stress-strain profiles of patients with isolated aortic insufficiency by defining and graphically displaying quantifiable regional and global, 3D left ventricular 1) end-systolic geometry; 2) end-diastolic geometry; 3) end-systolic stress; 4) systolic strain ( dobutamine); and 5) systolic stress/strain ratio. Follow-up studies will be correlated with onset of symptoms, plasma BNP levels, and referral for aortic valve replacement. If AVR is undertaken, the patients will be studied postoperatively to correlate very early preoperative indices with subsequent recovery of stress/strain indices.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neighborhood disadvantage, as indicated by low neighborhood socioeconomic status and poor social climate (e.g., low social cohesion), has been associated with a wide range of child and adolescent health and social problems. Evidence also indicates independent effects of neighborhood characteristics on drug use and sexual behavior. However, little research has examined the effect of neighborhood factors on the nexus between drug use and sexual behavior among adolescents. Informed by ecological theoretical frameworks, and using multivariate regression analyses, this cross-sectional study will examine the influence of neighborhood disadvantage (neighborhood poverty and low neighborhood social cohesion) on risky sexual behavior among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents, including the potential mediating role of adolescent drug use. The study will also assess whether parental monitoring provides a protective effect against the influence of neighborhood disadvantage on adolescent drug use. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), the study will focus on two particularly risky sexual behaviors, exchanging sex for drugs or money and having multiple sexual partners. Previous research on exchanging sex for drugs or money and having multiple sexual partners has focused on examining individual-level characteristics and behaviors that predict these sexual behaviors. This study's conceptual framework is based on the premise that individuals' behaviors are influenced by their environment and that consideration of environmental context can improve understanding of associations between individual-level behaviors and health outcomes. Given the large and disproportionate burden of HIV/STIs among youth, understanding the individual and environmental factors that contribute to risky sexual behaviors in this population is critical. Examining neighborhood disadvantage will contribute to understanding the context that underlies adolescent drug use and risky sexual behavior and can inform more effective and comprehensive prevention strategies. This study will examine the influence of neighborhood disadvantage on risky sexual behavior among adolescents, including the potential mediating role of adolescent drug use. Understanding the environmental factors that contribute to adolescent drug use and risky sexual behaviors will inform more effective and comprehensive strategies to prevent these behaviors and their consequences, including HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates many essential cellular processes including cell division. The recent development of cancer drugs that inhibit the proteasome suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may provide many new therapeutic targets. The goal of this project is to develop new chemical inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and to understand how this pathway regulates cell division. We first plan to characterize novel small molecule inhibitors of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC), a ubiquitin ligase that is essential for cell division. APC inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of cancer, because they may inhibit cell division or sensitize cells to antimitotic drugs such as taxol. Additionally, APC inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of diseases that involve axonal injury, because the APC negatively regulates axon growth. Our studies of these small molecules will also provide important new insights into how the APC is regulated by activator proteins. Another goal of our studies is to characterize ubistatins, compounds that prevent ubiquitin- dependent proteolysis by binding to ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanism of ubiquitin chain binding remains unclear, and we plan to synthesize new ubistatin derivatives that will allow us to determine the structure of ubistatins bound to ubiquitin chains. The structural information will enable us to synthesize more potent and perhaps more cell-permeable versions of ubistatins, enhancing the utility of these compounds to investigators in the field, and accelerating the development of ubiquitin-binding compounds as drug candidates. A third goal of our research program is to understand how ubiquitinated substrates are recognized for degradation by the proteasome. It has been assumed that a specific type of ubiquitin chain (linked through lysine-48 of ubiquitin) is required for degradation by the proteasome. Our studies of ubiquitinated cyclin B1 suggest that other types of ubiquitin linkages may be sufficient to target the protein for degradation. We therefore plan to determine the types of ubiquitination that are required for degradation of cyclin B1 by purified proteasomes and in complex cell extracts. These studies are critical for understanding how small molecule inhibitors of ubiquitination and ubiquitin chain recognition may perturb degradation. Finally, we want to understand how the localization of substrates affects their degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have identified a novel sequence element in cyclin B1 that recruits the protein to chromatin during mitosis. We plan to identify the protein that recruits cyclin B1 to chromatin, and to determine the functional consequences of cyclin B1 association with chromatin. Together these studies will provide new chemical tools for studying the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and will help us understand how a critical substrate of this pathway, cyclin B1, is regulated during the cell cycle.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will analyze the helper functions of HPV for Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) replication.  The parvovirus AAV has a complex life cycle, as a helper-dependent virus, as an autonomous virus in skin, or as an integrated provirus. It is known that adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and human papillomaviruses (HPV) can serve as helpers for AAV. While the adenovirus and herpesvirus helper genes have been studied, HPV helper genes are largely unstudied. We now find that of the HPV early genes E1 has the highest ability to help AAV replication. Our goal in this proposal is to characterize the extent and mechanism of E1 helper function for AAV. The knowledge we gain on E1 helper function for AAV will have dual utility: 1) AAV and HPV interact in skin and their interaction modulates the risk of cervical cancer. Understanding how HPV helps AAV replication, and the mechanism of action, will provide new insight into the cervical carcinogenesis process. 2) Second, rAAV is gaining increasing popularity as a human gene therapy vector. Understanding HPV helper functions for AAV should provide alternative strategies for rAAV production.  To analyze HPV helper function for AAV we will: Aim #1: Determine if HPV E1 regulates AAV DNA replication, transcription, and virion production. Aim #2: Investigate the mechanism of E1 helper function by mapping the  AAV helper domain  and  Rep78- interaction domain  within the HPV E1 protein. E1 mutants will be used to map the protein domains. Knowing the helper and Rep78 interaction domains within E1 protein will be the first step in deciphering El's mechanism of helper action. Aim #3: Investigate El's mechanism of action by observing cooperation/ complementation of E1 helper function with the known adenovirus helper genes.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Classical  primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with calcifications in the cardiovascular system and increased cardiovascular mortality. The evolution of primary hyperparathyroidism into a largely asymptomatic disorder has led to a significant body of research to reveal how and to what extent some of the classical target organs of the hyperparathyroid process may still be affected, despite the lack of overt evidence for dysfunction. The skeleton, for example, has clear and specific effects of parathyroid hormone excess, despite the disappearance of the skeletal hallmark of  classical  primary hyperparathyroidism, osteitis fibrosa cystica. These features would not have been discovered without utilizing a systematic approach with state-of-the-art methodologies. This proposal takes advantage of this same paradigm to determine whether the modern phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism still poses a risk to the cardiovascular system. Using state-of-the-art techniques chosen for their documented value in predicting cardiovascular outcomes, we will assess not only structural abnormalities (commonly seen in severe primary hyperparathyroidism), but also functional evidence of increased vascular stiffness. Furthermore, in a randomized clinical trial, we will determine whether the abnormalities demonstrated are reversible with cure of mild primary hyperparathyroidism. Finally, we will describe a cohort of more severely affected yet asymptomatic patients, in order to complete the profile of cardiovascular involvement in modern-day primary hyperparathyroidism. Investigation of cardiovascular manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism was identified as an important direction for future research by the 2002 NIH Workshop on Primary Hyperparathyroidism. A successful test of our hypothesis that key cardiovascular manifestations are present, and regress after surgical cure, could well alter the current standard-of-care for evaluation and management of this important metabolic bone disorder.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The spectrum of genetic diseases that can be therapeutically addressed by using lentiviral vectors is restricted by their oncogenic potential, which is inherent to their integrative nature. In this study we propose to develop and utilize novel non-integrating lentiviral vectors to address the above obstacle. Our approach is based on recent findings in our laboratory demonstrating the ability of the HIV-1 Rev/RRE system to function as a secondary packaging system, which mediates packaging of non-HIV-1 mRNAs into HIV-1 particles. We showed that HIV-1 RRE containing EIAV vectors efficiently packaged into HIV-1 particles. The novel chimeric vectors, which lacked the ability to integrate into a host cells' genome, exhibited transgene expression levels significantly higher than other non-integrating vectors, such as HIV-1 vectors packaged with the HIV-1 integrase mutant E152A. Here we propose to: i) characterize the mechanism involved in the Rev/RRE dependent packaging of chimeric EIAV/HIV-1 vectors; ii) characterize the ability of the HIV-1 to process the EIAV att sites and its effects on chimera vector integration; iii) investigate the effects of histone modifications and chromatin structure on transgene expression from EIAV/HIV-1 chimera vectors; iv) to characterize the biodistribution of the chimera EIAV/HIV-1 vectors; and v) to determine the efficacy of the chimera vectors at delivering and maintaining high levels of human factor IX expression in a humanized hemophilia mouse model We believe that the proposed studies will result in the development of efficacious non-integrating lentiviral vectors, which will be better suited for human gene therapy.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, type 2 (ADO2) is an osteosclerotic disorder that results from impaired osteoclastic bone resorption. The disorder usually results from missense mutations in the Chloride Channel 7 gene (CLCN7). Disease severity varies widely, even among members of the same family, and one third of individuals with mutations are asymptomatic carriers. In vitro studies in our laboratory indicate that osteoclasts from asymptomatic carriers resorb bone normally, while those from affected individuals have markedly defective bone resorption. Thus, the difference between affected individuals and carriers is due to osteoclast specific properties. Our preliminary data, are consistent with there being more than one modifier gene that is responsible for this difference. This proposal focuses on the creation of an ADO2 mouse model. This animal model will allow us to test potential therapies and find genes that control disease severity. Lay abstract: Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO2) is a disease in which there is dense, but fragile bone. The severity of the disease varies between carriers (who are disease free) and severely affected individuals, who have multiple fractures, bone infections and, occasionally, blindness. This proposal focuses on the creation of an ADO2 mouse model. This animal model will allow us to test potential therapies and find genes that control disease severity.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication non-adherence is a widespread problem with serious ramifications at every point in the human life cycle. Most of this burden is borne by adults 55 and older. Nationwide statistics make it clear that non- adherence presents a formidable problem for efforts to promote active lifestyles and increase health expectancy. Annually, non-adherence is responsible for 10 percent of hospitalizations, 125,000 deaths, and $100 B in healthcare costs. Most prior attempts to improve adherence have proven costly, labor-intensive, and overall minimally effective. The problem has been particularly refractory for chronic asymptomatic conditions such as hypercholesterolemia.     The solution to be studied in this SBIR was developed by two physician-scientists who have first-hand familiarity with non-adherence. They have developed a low-cost, consumer- and pharmacist-tested, telemedicine intervention that empowers patients to practice better adherence. This informatics-powered intervention has demonstrated usability in multiple Focus Groups, a randomized crossover pilot study, and most recently a commercial trial at a local pharmacy. In the controlled pilot study, medication adherence rose 33 percent relative to controls (p < 0.0001).     We now propose a randomized controlled trial of the intervention for a common and important application: statin use in adults 55 years and older with asymptomatic hypercholesterolemia. The main hypothesis to be tested is that the proprietary intervention can be used to boost and sustain medication adherence for senior adults with chronic asymptomatic illnesses. The study will randomize 100 subjects who already use atorvastatin to receive the intervention versus control (standard of care) and follow them over 8 months. Outcome measures will be daily adherence rates as measured by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps, monthly refill rates, persistency, over-medication error rates, and serum lipid profiles. Specific aims are to: (1) measure the effect of the intervention on atorvastatin adherence and persistency; and (2) assess the ability of the intervention to collect data on medication adherence, with MEMS caps as a reference. We anticipate that the intervention will (1) boost adherence and persistency; (2) reduce over-medication errors; and (3) provide an automated medication adherence database for patient care and public health surveys.     Based on iterative Focus Groups, consumer tests, materials trials, and pharmacist-directed development, we expect the intervention to be clinically effective, economical, easy-to-use, and widely accessible to patients. If the results support these predictions, the system can be scaled up rapidly to benefit the American population. A detailed business plan is in place to market the system to health care payers and pharmaceutical companies. The company has partnered with a nationwide pharmaceutical distributor to distribute medications in specially labeled bottles, and with various health-oriented merchants to fulfill rewards.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both women and men in the industrial world and despite the fact that early detection of CAD allows for successful and cost effective treatment of the disease, only 20% of CAD cases are diagnosed prior to a heart attack. Based on principles pioneered by the PI, SonoMedica, Inc. has developed a device that can non-invasively detect CAD in both its early (30% to 50% occlusive) and later stages (50% to 85% occlusive) by identifying the acoustic signatures associated with turbulent blood flow through partially occluded coronary arteries. No other approach to the detection of CAD promises to be as inexpensive, simple to perform, and risk free as the acoustic-based approach. The benefits to society of this device include wellness testing (screening) for asymptomatic individuals as well as longitudinal tracking of symptomatic patients. The objective milestone of Phase I research was to improve acoustic-based detection of CAD so that blockages between 30% to 85% could be detected with a sensitivity of 95% at a specificity of 80%. These goals were met as a single feature parameter was developed that achieves this level of diagnostic performance. The overriding goal of this Phase II proposal is to develop a marketable product to be placed in clinical trials in a number of hospitals. To achieve this goal, several tasks are proposed that will: further improve device performance through algorithm refinement, enhance the ability of the device to tolerate ambient noise by adding adaptive noise cancellation; and improve ease of use by adding online evaluations of data quality and artifact detection. The upgraded devices will then be evaluated in a prospective clinical study. This work also includes plans to develop a Phase II clinical trial and related marketing and commercialization efforts.   RELEVANCE: The medical instrument that will be developed in this proposal addresses a major medical issue, the noninvasive detection of blockages in the coronary arteries. This disease, know as coronary artery disease, is arguably the most important fatal disease in the US, causing one-third to one-half of all deaths in people between the ages of 35 and 64. The instrument being developed is based on acoustic detection of turbulent blood flow and promises to be less expensive and easier to use than any other approach, and it is completely risk free. The substantial benefits to society of this device include wellness testing (screening) for asymptomatic individuals and longitudinal tracking of symptomatic patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the most prominent strategies of cancer chemoprevention might be protecting cells or tissues against various endo- and exogenous carcinogens and carcinogenic metabolites. This protection could be achieved through the induction of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes, a process mediated mainly by the antioxidant response elements (ARE) located in the promoter of these genes. Our previous application entitled  Regulation of Phase 2 Genes by Chemopreventive Agent BHA  focused on the early signaling events leading to the induction of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. Our results demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MARK) and the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a basic leucine zipper transcription factors, play important roles in ARE-mediated gene expression. Multiple functional motifs have been identified in Nrf2 to elicit the antioxidant response. The activation of Nrf2 signaling appears to be a multiple-step process. Under unstimulated condition, Nrf2 per se can maintain a cytosolic sequestration, which may be further strengthened by the interaction with an actin-binding protein, Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keapl). Upon exposure to oxidative stress or treatments of Chemopreventive agents, Nrf2 dissociates from Keapl, translocates to the nucleus, binds to the AREs and transactivates phase 2 detoxifying and antioxidant genes. In this renewal application entitled  Chemopreventive Functional Analysis of Nrf2 , we will focus on the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 signaling by testing the hypothesis that Nrf2 functions as a sensor for diverse dietary Chemopreventive compounds and regulator of cancer chemoprotective genes expression. We will examine the releasing mechanism of Nrf2 from cytosolic sequestration of Keapl by various dietary cancer Chemopreventive compounds, mechanism that govern the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, as well as the mechanisms regulating Nrf2 nuclear retention and transactivation. The results of these investigations will provide fundamental knowledge for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 signaling as well as for better designing of Nrf2 targeted drugs and cancer Chemopreventive agents, which is one of our long-term goals.',\n",
       " 'Despite advances in cancer genetics and treatment, anticancer drug resistance remains a formidableproblemand challenge to oncologists and researchers alike. The long-term goat of this project has been the dissectionof mechanisms of tumor multidrug resistance. It was known previously that anticancer drug resistance at thecellular level, even to a single agent, is a multifactorial phenomenon; multiple genetic changes can occur in atumor cell selected for resistance to any particular cytotoxic agent. Complementing this view, we havelearned more recently that the putative targets of anticancer agents and mediators of their actions playcomplex roles in cellular physiology and drug responsiveness. For example, topoisomerases undergo post-translational modifications in response to drug treatments, and these modifications have revealed a complexsignaling pathway involving sumoylation that is also involved in drug responses. Further, with regard toABC transporters, which mediate multidrug resistance, we have learned that one member of this class,MRP1/ABCC1, appears to be regulated by the signaling molecule Notch-1, and that another member,BCRP/ABCG2, is regulated by estrogen. Accordingly, study of novel mechanisms of regulation of ABCprotein expression may afford unique methods to circumvent drug resistance. Thus, expanding on thehistorical focus of our laboratory efforts in ABC transporters and topoisomerases, we wish to build on thenew knowledge of the past few years and on the progress we have made in the prior funding period to test thehypothesis that novel regulatory mechanisms for expression of topoisomerases and ABC proteins affectanticancer drug responses and offer insights into new therapeutic paradigms. Building on work done in theprior funding period, I offer here a focused application and propose the following specific aims to test ourhypothesis: (1) Define the molecular mechanisms of regulation of topoisomerases in mammalian tumors anddrug-mediated cytotoxiciry through these enzymes; (2) Define the role of Ubc9 and protein sumoylation inanticancer drug responsiveness; and (3) Define the molecular mechanisms of novel regulation by Notch-1 ofexpression of the ABC transporter,MRP1/ABCC1.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a prevalent disorder in the spectrum of affective illness affecting woman, associated with significant morbidity. The neurobiology of this evolving, relatively understudied condition is not well understood. The aim of this study is to examine and characterize the systems-level neuropathophysiology of PMDD, taking into account menstrual cycle phase and menstrual cycle mood response variability of female subjects, in the context of a specific neurobiological model of fronto-limbic- striatal function. Specifically, we propose the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods with specific neuropsychological probes of emotional processing and behavioral control (functions of clinical relevance to the symptomatology of PMDD), and their interaction, in well-characterized patient samples, to test mechanistic hypotheses concerning fronto-limbic-striatal circuit dysfunction in PMDD, in comparison to asymptomatic female control subjects. We will examine the neural activity at two specified points in the menstrual cycle of each subject, once during the premenstrual phase (during the peak period of symptomatology in PMDD) and once during the postmenstrual phase. We hope to determine whether the provisional DSM-IV psychiatric diagnostic category of PMDD has an associated functional neuroanatomical profile in brain systems involved in the regulation of emotion and behavior. Such a neurobiological characterization of PMDD, in relation to asymptomatic female control subjects, can increase our understanding of the neurobiological spectrum of affective disorders. It is also of relevance given the increased incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females, and will provide a necessary foundation for the development of more targeted, biologically based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PMDD.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-1 like 3G (APOBEC3G, A3G) corresponds to a host-derived cytidine deaminase that displays potent anti-retroviral activity. When incorporated into budding HIV virions, the A3G enzyme massively mutates nascent HIV DNA produced during reverse transcription in the next target cell thereby halting HIV growth. HIV counters these effects of A3G through its Vif gene product, which promotes accelerated proteasome-mediated degradation and partially impaired de novo synthesis of A3G. The intracellular depletion of A3G makes the antiviral enzyme unavailable for incorporation into progeny virions. Our recent studies have unveiled a second antiviral action of A3G operating in resting CD4 T-cells. In these T-lymphocytes, cellular A3G functions as a highly active post-entry restriction factor blocking the growth of both wild type and deltaVif forms of HIV. Whether this  Vif-resistant  anti-HIV defense mediated by A3G involves cytidine deamination or a different mechanism is currently unknown. Further, the mechanism by which this post-entry restricting function of A3G is forfeited when T-cells are activated remains incompletely understood. Similarly, little is known about how host cells safeguard their own DNA from the mutagenic effects of A3G. Finally, it remains unknown whether A3G exerts other key functions beyond these antiviral effects. In Specific Aim 1, experiments will be performed to decipher how A3G and the closely related A3F and A3B antiviral enzymes are regulated in cells. In Specific Aim 2, the mechanism of A3G action as a post-entry restriction factor in resting CD4 T-cells, the range of viruses affected by this restriction, and potential similar functions of A3F will be delineated. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, studies will be conducted to assess whether A3G mediates important non-antiviral functions in mammalian cells. These experiments will involve the preparation and analysis of mice lacking the functional analogue of the A3G gene. Together, this program of proposed experimentation promises to enrich our understanding of the biology of A3G as well as the related A3F and A3B enzymes. With such understanding, new therapeutic strategies for inhibiting HIV growth could emerge.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. Of particular importance is the discovery and development of compounds that are active against virus isolates resistant to currently approved therapies. We recently reported on 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid (PA-457), first in a new class of HIV-1 inhibitors that block virus replication by disrupting virus maturation. Unlike protease inhibitors, PA-457 blocks a single step in the processing of the viral Gag protein. Specifically, PA-457 disrupts the cleavage of the Gag capsid (CA) precursor (CA-SP1) to mature CA protein resulting in the release of immature, non-infectious viral particles. Importantly, PA-457's distinct mechanism of action allows the compound to retain potent activity against HIV-1 strains resistant to the current classes of approved drugs. Work by our group and others suggest that residues within the HIV-1 Gag CA-SP1 domain serve as determinants of PA-457 activity and genetic variation within this domain allows HIV-1 to escape PA-457- mediated inhibition. Most recent results support the theory that a direct interaction between the compound and an oligomeric form of Gag is critical to PA-457 activity. While these observations allow some insights into the PA-457 antiviral effect, the mechanisms of action and resistance to PA-457 remain to be fully determined. To address these issues, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To further characterize the mechanism of action of PA-457 activity, and (2) To further characterize the molecular determinants of PA-457 activity. We believe that the results of these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms of action and resistance of PA- 457. A better understanding of both of these issues is particularly relevant due to PA-457's ongoing clinical development. We are also confident that the results of these studies will be directly applicable to the design of additional broadly active HIV-1 maturation inhibitors effective against both WT HIV-1 strains and the resistant virus isolates that emerge in PA-457-treated patients. Drug resistance is the leading reason for HIV treatment failure. Successful completion of the proposed research will help identify and design additional HIV maturation inhibitors that will provide additional treatment options and improve disease outcome.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training program for the development of an independent researcher in the area of reproductive infectious diseases, specifically genital herpes infections in women. This award would provide the applicant valuable didactic training and human and animal research experience from a multidisciplinary mentoring team. An important contributor to the epidemic spread of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is its high frequency of asymptomatic shedding in the genital tract, as transmission of the virus usually occurs during these periods of subclinical reactivation. Therefore, an improved understanding of the risk factors associated with HSV-2 reactivation and shedding are urgently needed. In addition, it is important to improve our understanding of the pathomechanisms associated with HSV-2 reactivation. As hormonal contraceptives are used by more than 100 million women worldwide and bacterial vaginosis is a very common cause of vaginal symptoms, even modest associations with genital shedding of HSV-2 would result in substantial attributable risks for transmission of the virus. Therefore, this research will assess: 1. The effects of hormonal contraceptive use, either oral contraceptive pills or depo-medroxyprogesterone, on daily genital tract shedding of HSV-2 compared to women who do not use hormonal contraceptives in a natural history study of 102 women 2. The effects of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on the daily genital tract shedding of HSV-2 by evaluating shedding frequency before and after treatment of bacterial vaginosis in 30 women 3. The effects of exogenous sex steroids on the capacity of HSV-specific T lymphocytes to inhibit HSV reactivation in sensory neurons and subsequent shedding on epithelial surfaces in a murine model.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to establish a structural and functional atlas of the heart. Initially comprising cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, together with derived functional analyses and associated clinical variables, the database will be extendible to allow inclusion of data from a variety of imaging and other sources. Cardiac MRI examinations provide detailed, quantitative data on heart structure and function, and standardized protocols are now routinely used in a number of studies. The initial goals of this project are to facilitate statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion characteristics, across population groups, via the application of parametric mathematical modeling tools. This project will combine cardiac modeling and biophysical analysis methods developed by the University of Auckland with structural database and probabilistic mapping infrastructure developed by the UCLA Center for Computational Biology (CCB). The mission of the National Centers for Biological Computing collaboration program will be advanced by extending the application area of the CCB to another organ: the heart. The specific aims of the project are to: 1) Establish a database of cardiac MRI studies of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Data from two large studies will be used to initiate the database: MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), consisting of 5,004 asymptomatic subjects, and DETERMINE (Defibrillators to Reduce Risk by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evaluation), consisting of 10,000 patients with myocardial infarction. 2) Develop tools and procedures to enable cardiac MRI studies to be classified, labeled, and searched using standardized protocols. Procedures and ontologies for the characterization and classification of anatomical and physiological data will be extended to cardiac MRI examinations. 3) Develop downloadable software tools for the mapping of cardiac structure and function, transformation of results between studies, and the probabilistic evaluation of temporal abnormalities in regional heart wall motion, in relation to population subgroups. This project will significantly improve the evaluation of cardiac performance and disease processes, establish characteristic parameters of cardiac structure and function on a regional basis, and enable the evaluation of clinical cases in relation to the statistical distributions within patient subgroups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart disease is the number one killer in the USA and many other countries around the world. Significant time and money are spent researching heart function in health and disease using magnetic resonance imaging. By pooling data from many studies into a single resource, researchers will be able to perform standardized comparisons across many patient groups, in order to better predict and evaluate the effects of disease and treatment.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The display of proteins in dense, repetitive arrays in known to result in strong humoral immune responses, as exemplified by the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine for human papillomavirus. This concept has relevance to HIV-1 vaccine development, because recent structural studies of HIV-1 virions have shown that the envelope spikes on the virus surface are sparse and irregularly distributed. This may contribute to low spike immunogenicity, and complicate the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.     This proposal will test the hypothesis that the immunogenicity of HIV-1 envelope spikes is limited, in part, as a result of their sparse and irregular distribution on the virion surface. To do this, HIV-1 envelope spikes will be displayed at high density on a repetitively ordered scaffold (provided by the bacteriophage lambda capsid). Env display will be acheived using a simple in vitro complementation system, to  decorate  phage particles with soluble Env oligomers, produced in mammalian cells. In the R21 (feasibility) phase of this proposal, experiments will be conducted to generate lambda phage particles that display well-characterized, oligomeric envelope spikes on their surface at both high and low density. The immunogenicity of these phage particles will then be assessed in a small animal model, to determine if ordered, high density display of envelope spikes results in a measurable increase in the magnitude or quality of Env-specific antibody responses (including virus-neutralizing antibodies).     If quantifiable milestones are met, the project will progress to the R33 (development) phase. This phase focus on the evaluation of methods intended to further improve the quality and magnitude of the humoral immune response elicited by lambda phage particles displaying HIV-1 Env. The focus will be on the evaluation of practical, translationally-relevant strategies that can be readily applied to enhance humoral immune responses to the phage-displayed envelope spikes. The studies will culminate in a proof-of- concept immunogenicity study in non-human primates, in which the immune response to phage-displayed envelope spikes will compared to that elicited by a soluble oligomeric envelope preparation.     Collectively, these experiments are expected to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept evaluation of our hypothesis that ordered, dense display of HIV-1 envelope spikes on the lambda phage scaffold will allow for the generation of improved antibody responses to HIV-1 Env.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy has vast potential for treating and potentially curing a wide variety of disorders. However, gene delivery technologies require significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and expression stability before the majority of these diseases can be treated. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) have proven themselves to be highly promising, both in the laboratory and the clinic, but they still suffer from several shortcomings. In particular, the majority of the human population has been exposed to AAV serotype 2, as well as other serotypes, and as a result the immune system is primed to neutralize AAV. Antibody neutralization of AAV vectors is an established problem, and cellular immune responses may also be a challenge. We will attempt to solve the former problem and will further investigate basic mechanisms involved in the latter. For the former, we have developed novel directed evolution technology to generate new mutants of AAV with new properties. Specifically, large libraries of virus with random point mutations in the capsid gene encoding the viral coat protein are generated, and variants with novel properties are selected using high throughput screens. We have utilized this approach to generate variants with altered receptor binding properties, as well as variants that escape neutralization by antibodies that greatly inhibit AAV gene delivery by the wild type capsid or coat proteins. We will study the potential of human antibody evading variants to mediate high efficiency gene delivery of the therapeutic gene erythropoietin to the muscle and liver of animals carrying anti-AAV antibodies. In addition, while AAV neutralization by antibodies is an established problem, much less is known about AAV interactions with other components of the immune system. Therefore, the basic mechanisms of immune neutralization of this virus by complement [and T cells] will be investigated to both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, viruses have naturally evolved for their own ends, which do not always meet the needs of a human therapeutic. The novel approaches developed in this work to re-evolve viruses into enhanced human therapeutics will therefore have broad and general impact on the molecular engineering of enhanced viral gene delivery vehicles, including alternate AAV serotypes as well as other vectors. Furthermore, it will yield insights into the responses of other immune system components to AAV.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): N. gonorrhoeae C. trachomatis, and T. vaginalis are biological cofactors that facilitate transmission of HIV. The recen union of population survey techniques and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) provides an important new tool for studying the prevalence and distribution of these STIs In the population. Results using this methodology have produced dramatic evidence of a large, hidden epidemic of asymptomatic infections The 1997-98 Baltimore STD and Behavior Survey (BSBS) estimated that 7.9% of Baltimore adults ages 18 to 35 - and 15.0% of African-American women in that age group- had an undiagnosed and untreated gonococcal o chlamydial infection.  Traditional approaches to STI epidemiology have monitored STI incidence by tracking counts of infections reported to public health departments. The BSBS found, however, that the number of undiagnosed infections prevalent in the population substantially exceeded the count of infections diagnosed and reported to the public health authorities each year This finding documents one of the major scientific inadequacies of the traditional approach to STI epidemiology. Estimates of the burden of STIs derived from NAAT testing in population surveys provide a new paradigm for studying the epidemiology of untreated and largely asymptomatic infections. We propose a research program to study changes in the prevalence, distribution, and correlates in the population of untreated N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and T. vaginalis infections over a 4-year period. To capitalize on the availability of population prevalence estimates for 1997-98, this research will be carried out in Baltimore, MD. To permit economical data collection, T-ACASI telephone surveys will be conducted with probability samples of Baltimore adults. Over a 48 month period, 4,800 survey respondents will be offered the opportunity of STI testing using mail-out, mail-back test kits. (In a pilot test of this methodology, 85% of Baltimore residents who completed a survey interview mailed back urine specimens when a monetary incentive was offered.) This research is important both from a scientific and a public health perspective. The Institute of Medicine and JAMA have drawn attention to the need for research to unveil Ihe hidden epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases . This research takes the next step toward this goal - moving from studying the prevalence of untreated infections to tracking changes over time in the prevalence, distribution, and correlates of these untreated infections.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rotator cuff disease ranks among the most prevalent of surgically treated musculoskeletal disorders. As pain is the primary indication for treatment, our long-term goal is to better understand the natural history of symptom development in rotator cuff disease. This information is fundamental to establishing prognosis and guidelines for surgical vs. nonsurgical treatment. The primary objective of this study is to use ultrasonography of asymptomatic tears to longitudinally determine the relationship between tear deterioration and new symptom development. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1: To establish the probability that an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear seen in the context of contralateral symptoms will become symptomatic over time. A population of 235 individuals identified as having either an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear (N=185) or normal cuff (N=50) detected when obtaining bilateral ultrasound examinations for a contralateral painful shoulder will be recruited for study. They will be prospectively followed with exams and outcome evaluation for 3-5 years to study the prevalence of symptom development. Specific Aim 2: To determine with ultrasonography, the probability that a rotator cuff tear will enlarge over time. For all 185 individuals with asymptomatic cuff tears, a high resolution ultrasound will be performed yearly to determine whether or not there is any significant (>5mm) full-thickness tear size progression or whether partial tears progress to full tears over time. Specific Aim 3: To determine if symptom progression correlates with enlargement of the rotator cuff tear and/or degenerative changes on radiographs. Results from ultrasounds for tear enlargement and radiographs for degenerative changes will be correlated to the presence of new pain via a shoulder-specific validated assessment tool. Secondary aims will include comparison of results to asymptomatic individuals with no tear. This will control for pain variables accountable to the presence of the rotator cuff tear. Other secondary aims will include the comparison of multiple demographic variables to the development of pain. In our pilot studies, many asymptomatic patients appeared to develop symptoms. The proposed project would be innovative in that patients with asymptomatic tears can be longitudinally followed during this time of symptom development. Statistical power would exist to correlate tear size progression or other factors to symptoms. This knowledge should directly determine the necessity for early preventative treatment and cuff tear surveillance. Most importantly, the information should be critical in formulating indications and objectives for operative intervention a fundamental issue in caring for patients with rotator cuff tears.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is recognized as a growing problem among adolescents, particularly in minority populations. While T2DM previously represented less than 5% of new diabetes diagnoses in pediatrics, it now accounts for as much as 50% of new diagnoses. The treatment of T2DM in adolescents requires comprehensive care that includes behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. Studies show that approximately 50% of adolescents with chronic problems do not comply with care recommendations. This non-adherence can be exacerbated by patient, provider and system attributes. Addressing patient, provider and system barriers to care are crucial in the development of a successful comprehensive program for the treatment of T2DM in adolescents.  This proposal will advance current knowledge about T2DM in adolescents through emphasis on identifying barriers to care, and applying this information to the development and evaluation of a comprehensive intervention to improve adolescent diabetes care. To accomplish these goals I will work with Dr. Robert Dittus, Director of the Vanderbilt Center for Health Services Research, Dr. William Russell, Division Chief of Pediatric Endocrinology, and Dr. David Schlundt, Co-director of the Behavioral Core of the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC) to further my career development in (1) adolescent diabetes, (2) methods for identifying and measuring psychosocial determinants of adolescent behavior, and (3) designing and evaluating interventions to improve self-management behaviors and treatment adherence in adolescents with T2DM.  The specific aims of this research will be to: (1) perform surveys and focus groups to identify patient/parent barriers to care for adolescents with T2DM and strategies for addressing these barriers (2) examine provider and system barriers to proper management of adolescent T2DM, and (3) to use this information to develop and implement a randomized controlled trial of a new comprehensive diabetes management program for adolescents with T2DM. The process and results of this research will provide valuable insights into adolescent diabetes, and will accelerate my future independent investigation in adolescent T2D.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21 application will assess the feasibility of using RNA amplified from left ventricular (LV) biopsies of patients during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, in order to identify gene expression signatures of early cardiac remodeling. As a first attempt to obtain a gene signature from pre-symptomatic patients, this represents a novel area of investigation with the potential to enhance health-related research. With the aging of the US population, and improved survival of older patients after myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure is a huge public health challenge. It is the primary diagnosis for hospitalization of people over 65: The population-attributable risk for heart failure is 62% from coronary artery disease (CAD), 17% from smoking, and 10% from hypertension. Once individuals develop symptoms of heart disease, remodeling of the heart has already occurred. We propose to improve treatment by identifying molecular pathways that are novel therapeutic targets for early prevention of this remodeling process, in patients with ischemic heart disease. Despite increasing use of microarrays, we have little knowledge of early changes in the human cardiac transcriptome in asymptomatic patients with cardiac dysfunction that could lead to failure. This is in large part because insufficient tissue is available for RNA hybridization to arrays, except from explanted failing hearts or during ventricular assist device (VAD) surgery. However, when cardiac dysfunction has progressed to full blown failure, the complex early, compensatory and late molecular changes cannot be disentangled. We propose a novel approach - to obtain gene expression profiles from amplified RNA of LV biopsies from CABG patients with ischemic heart disease at all stages of heart failure - presymptomatic to severe - in order to distinguish gene expression profiles that foreshadow heart failure in asymptomatic patients (ACC/AHA stages A and B), in patients with impaired cardiac function (stage C) and patients with severe failure (stage D). Our laboratory now successfully performs (two-step) amplification of ng amounts of RNA from biopsy-sized cardiac specimens. We also developed a new clinical data collection tool to allow stratification of patients according to clinical and lifestyle variables. Specific Aims are (1): to test the feasibility of identifying cardiac gene expression signatures of patients with ischemic heart disease, as a function of increasing severity of heart failure; (2): to test the feasibility of identifying the contribution of a preventable risk factor (smoking) to the transcriptome of at risk patients with ischemic heart disease and thus assess the ability to segregate patients according to risk factors. These studies will break new ground by identifying novel applications for gene profiling from nanogram quantities of RNA from asymptomatic patients, will help identify gene signatures of early stages in cardiac disease development, and will constitute a first step towards pre- emptive medicine. These pilot studies will help identify gene expression signatures from pre-symptomatic patients with incipient heart failure. This will provide an important first step towards our goal of pre-emptive or preventative medicine. In this manner, in the future, patients can be aggressively treated before significant disease progression occurs.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A viruses cause epidemics and pandemics in human populations, inflicting enormous suffering and economical loss. Currently, two distinct strategies - vaccines and low molecular weight drugs - are utilized to control the spread of influenza. Vaccination offers limited protection and is hampered by logistic challenges: accurate prediction of future circulating strains and production of sufficient quantities of vaccine for large populations in a short time. Four antiviral drugs have been approved in the United States for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Two of them, amantadine and rimantadine, inhibit the viral M2 ion channel protein, and other two, zanamivir and oseltamivir, inhibit the viral neuraminidase activity. Besides the limited therapeutic window, side effects and high costs, most circulating viruses are already resistant to the two M2 inhibitors and development of resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors is inevitable if they are widely used. The need to develop novel influenza therapeutics that can prevent viral resistance or significantly reduce its incidence is urgent and compelling. We have developed bi-functional polymer-attached zanamivir and sialic acid (a competitive inhibitor of viral hemagglutinin) based on (i) the principle of combination therapy of simultaneously interfering with two distinct targets on the virus and (ii) the observation that polymeric forms of a competitive inhibitor are much more potent than the monomeric counterpart. In preliminary studies, we have shown that the bi-functional polymer-attached inhibitor is much more potent than monomeric inhibitors or mono-functional polymer-attached inhibitors. In this application, we propose to 1) enhance the antiviral activity of the polymer-attached inhibitors by systematically optimize the level of conjugation and the type and size of the polymer backbone and the linker, 2) systematically evaluate the potency of the polymer-attached inhibitors in appropriate human target cells and animal models to a broad range of influenza virus isolates, including the highly pathogenic avian viruses H5N1 and H7N7, 3) to quantitatively assess the ability of the polymer-attached inhibitors to reduce viral resistance, and 4) to elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of the polymer-attached inhibitors so as to further rationally improve their antiviral activities. It is anticipated that the proposed research will (i) yield one or more highly potent, optimized polymer-attached inhibitor(s) for future clinical development and (ii) provide a new paradigm of drug development for overcoming microbial drug resistance',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed grant is to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of action by which the human innate and acquired immune systems protect from Entamoeba histolytica disease. Humans vary in their susceptibility to disease, and 90% of those who acquire E. histolytica infection remain asymptomatic. While there are many host, pathogen, and environmental factors that influence disease development, undoubtedly the host's immune response, as determined by their genetic make up, plays a primary role.     The proposed research will address two major aims. Aim 1 will study gene expression at the mRNA and protein level by determining cytokine responses associated with resistance or susceptibility to E. histolytica disease. The study cohort will involve children already being prospectively observed for diarrheal disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh, an area endemic for E. histolytica infection. We intend to use cultured PBMCs to determine cytokine responses from both the innate and acquired immune responses. We will measure cytokines at baseline (while uninfected) in children who have never had E. histolytica infection, children who have had asymptomatic colonization only, and children who have had invasive disease. We will also measure cytokines in children who have current asymptomatic E. histolytica infection and children with active E. histolytica diarrhea. In addition, fecal cytokines will be measured during colonization vs. diarrheal disease from E. histolytica to sample more specifically the mucosal immune response.     Aim 2 will genotype a cohort of children in order to determine associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) in immune response genes and resistance or susceptibility to E. histolytica disease. The genes studied in Aim 1 will be genotyped in Aim 2, therefore significant SNPS can be evaluated for associations with cytokine gene function.     Amebiasis, primarily due to Entamoeba histolytica, remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Successful completion of these studies will allow us to determine the functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes, and their association with E. histolytica infection and disease. This will provide insight into the mechanisms by which the human immune system protects against amebiasis.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this application is to understand the molecular pathogenesis of infection with the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. The parasite is an important pathogen in immunosuppressed populations and is classified by the NIAID as a category B biodefense organism. Nevertheless, in most cases infection with this widespread parasite is asymptomatic. Host survival during infection requires robust Type 1 cytokine production, yet overly exuberant responses can result in host pathology and death. Thus, both parasite and host benefit from regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. The underlying hypothesis to be tested is that T. gondii possesses molecular mechanisms to subvert host signaling pathways leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Recent work has revealed the ability of Toxoplasma to down-regulate cytokines such as TNF-1 from within infected cells. Increasing evidence indicates this is achieved through sophisticated manipulation of host intracellular signaling cascades. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms by which Toxoplasma subverts pro-inflammatory signaling cascades in the innate immune system, in particular within cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells that are targeted for in vivo infection. Cellular and biochemical methods will be employed to define the points at which Toxoplasma interferes with host signal transduction. In this regard, parasite-induced activation of signaling molecule STAT3, known to be involved in down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-1, will be examined. The nature of TNF-1 suppression in infected macrophages is profound. Therefore, we will employ molecular methods to determine how the parasite influences promoter activity of the TNF-1 gene. The last part of this proposal will focus effort on examining if parasite-infected macrophages and dendritic cells display a suppression phenotype during in vivo mouse infections. This will be accomplished using cellular and immunological methods to determine IL-12 and TNF-1 production in infected cells in vivo and their in vivo ability to respond to defined Toll-like receptor ligands. In addition, macrophage and dendritic cell expression of cell surface activation markers will be analyzed. From these studies, we expect to gain important information on how T. gondii interacts with the host innate immune system, allowing a deeper understanding of infection with this important opportunistic pathogen.    PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that Toxoplasma infects between 30-80% of the human population worldwide. While normally an asymptomatic infection, with suboptimal immune function the parasite emerges as a devastating and sometimes lethal infection. This project will enhance our understanding of immunity to the parasite, leading to improved treatment strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The work described in this grant application will bring about fundamental knowledge in two important areas of current aging research. The first is calorie restriction (CR), which is a dietary regimen known to provide broad health benefits and longevity. The second is SIR2 and its related proteins (sirtuins), which have emerged in the past five years as important regulators of aging in a broad spectrum of model organisms. Studies in the prior period have begun to identify pathways by which CR operates in C. elegans. The first two aims in this grant will focus in on these pathway and identify hormones and cellular processes that are critical for CR to extend the lifespan of worms. We have pinpointed two neurons in the head that trigger broad physiological changes in response to CR, such as an increase in respiration, and we will figure out what hormonal factor these cells release to bring about the observed changes leading to long lifespan. In the third aim, we will study in detail the four sirtuin genes in C. elegans. Since sirtuins have been linked to CR in other organisms, we will investigate whether this is true in worms, which sirtuins are involved, and how they bring about their effects. The C. elegans system we have set up to study CR offers many advantages, including all of the genetic and molecular tools that have solved many other important biological problems in the nematode model.  CR itself has salutary effects against many of the major diseases of aging in rodent models. It is possible that a molecular understanding of CR will allow us to tap genetic pathways to provide broad health benefits for our aging population. This approach is complementary to the current focus on the molecular details of particular diseases to develop specific therapies. Beyond this important practical outcome, this study will provide important new information on the sirtuins and pathways that relate diet to physiology. There is an excellent foundation to build on in the next granting period and important findings are anticipated.  Public Health relevance:  Dietary restriction is the most robust intervention that extends life span and improves health in mammals. This project details a study of dietary restriction in the roundworm C. elegans that will identify new genes, mechanisms and pathways driving this process. Our findings may lead to new therapeutic approaches to diseases of aging in humans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, exhibit neural degeneration in the acute phase, neuroregeneration in the chronic indeterminate (asymptomatic) phase, and degeneration of neurons in the chronic symptomatic phase. Most patients remain asymptomatic and with signs of neuronal regeneration for years or decades. Some asymptomatic patients progress to the chronic, fatal chronic disease stage. It remains unknown why patients can remain asymptomatic and with signs of neural regeneration for decades while others develop neurodegeneration later in life. Recent studies demonstrate that T. cruzi expresses surface membrane-bound and shed parasite-derived mimic of neurotrophic factors (PDNF), formerly known as neuraminidase/trans-sialidase, that potently promotes survival of several types of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes. A major and wide audience-reaching finding in the previous five years was that PDNF induces survival and differentiation of neurons by binding and activating TrkA nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. This unique result opens up many interesting avenues to understand the molecular basis of a microbial invader of the nervous system, specifically whether T. cruzi, via PDNF, like authentic host growth factors, recognizes other neurotrophin receptors, triggers off neurotransmitter rate-limiting enzymes through Trks receptors, bear neurotrophin motifs that can be exploited as synthetic peptides to reverse neuronal and glial damage, and elicit autoimmune responses to Trks that might activate or inhibit receptor function. The project will utilize a combination of cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, and immunochemical approaches to identify and characterize the interaction of TrkA and other receptors with PDNF and the novel Trk autoantibodies. Most likely, the outcome of the proposed studies will provide insights into the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease, particularly neuroregeneration, and lead to the development of compounds, principally NGF-like peptidomimetics, to treat not only Chagas' disease but also other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lumbar spinal stenosis is known as a common and severely disabling condition affecting older persons. Our recently completed R-01 grant has challenged the standard for diagnosis by showing that stenosis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has little to do with the clinical syndrome of stenosis. Electromyography (EMG) was shown to be a useful test. However the study did not look claudication (leg pain on walking), an extreme symptom of stenosis. Claudication can also occur in vascular disease. It is important clinically and scientifically to positively differentiate these two causes of claudication. Specific Aims: Determine the ability of MRI and EMG to separate persons with neurogenic claudication from persons with vascular claudication, and asymptomatic controls. Hypotheses: 1. The presence and severity of neurogenic claudication relate to both MRI spinal canal geometry and electrodiagnostic abnormalities. 2. Neurogenic claudication can be discerned from vascular claudication by use of MRI and EMG findings. Research design: Prospective, masked, controlled study. Methods: Three groups of persons aged 55-80, including asymptomatic volunteers, persons with definitive vascular claudication, and persons with neurogenic claudication, will be obtained by screening persons from the community, vascular surgery clinic, and spine program; having them undergo examinations by a vascular and neurosurgeon as well as ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing. Candidates with consensus diagnosis will undergo masked EMG and MRI scans, ambulation questionnaires, a 6 minute ambulation test and a 5 day activity monitor evaluation. We will determine sensitivity, specificity, and discriminant value of MRI (minimum canal diameter) and EMG (composite fibrillation score) in separating those with isolated neurogenic claudication from those with vascular claudication and asymptomatic controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. The surprising result of our previous NIH funded study shows that 'spinal stenosis' on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans does not separate people with 'spinal stenosis'--a sometimes severely disabling disease that is treated with surgery--from persons with plain old back ache or no pain at all. Electromyography (EMG) was successful, but since the study could be criticized for not including many people with severe stenosis, this proposal looks at EMG and MRI scans in those with the most severe stenosis complaint (claudication, or leg cramping with walking), in comparason to persons with artery disease in the legs, which is another cause of claudication. The results will help doctors avoid unnecessary surgery and help scientists to understand more about how spinal stenosis disables so many older people.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We postulate that preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long asymptomatic period in which the accumulation of cerebral lesions eventually results in dementia. To be truly effective, therapeutic interventions for AD may need to be initiated in this preclinical stage, prior to the occurrence of extensive and irreversible brain image. Because preclinical AD is asymptomatic, antecedent biological markers, neuroimaging measures, or other indicators need to be developed for its antemortem identification.    In this application, we test the hypothesis that biomarkers and other indicators of the cerebral changes of preclinical AD can be detected in middle age individuals, particularly those who are at increased risk for AD. We will recruit, assess, and follow two groups of adult children: those with a biologic parent with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and those for whom neither parent has DAT. Four integrated projects, supported by Administration and Clinical Cores, will evaluate antecedent biomarkers in this Adult Children Study (ACS).  Project 1 will compare cerebral binding of the amyloid imaging tracer, Pittsburgh Compound B, in the 2 groups of ACS participants. Project 2 will assay markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (including A?, tau, and sulfatide) and conduct proteomic studies to evaluate AD risk as a function of family history and apoE genotype. Project 3 will explore attentional performance profiles, within-subject performance variability, and personality dimensions as indicators of preclinical AD. Project 4 will use structural MRI to assess volume, shape, and thickness of selected brain regions as potential neuroanatomical markers of preclinical AD.    Although we appreciate that this is a high risk, high reward application, we are fully committed to the successful completion of our aims and are uniquely positioned to do so: we have demonstrated the feasibility of enrolling the ACS cohort, have an interdisciplinary team of highly accomplished investigators with a long track record of productive collaboration, and are supported by the remarkable resources and infrastructure of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a complementary Program project at Washington University.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidating the molecular determinants of drug absorption, elimination and disposition is an important goal in cancer therapeutics because it can provide the mechanistic basis for the rational development of agents that can be administered orally, and that are better able to penetrate target tissues. In addition, it can help to predict how simultaneously administered drugs affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of anticancer agents, inform the field of pharmacogenetics by identifying the genes for which polymorphisms are likely to impact treatment and help to explain side effects that are related to drug disposition. P-glycoprotein (PGP), an ABC transporter that functions as a plasma membrane efflux pump, is an established factor that limits oral bioavailability, facilitates hepatobiliary elimination, and restricts penetration of cancer chemotherapeutics into brain and fetus. Investigations of Pgp knock-out mouse were crucial to these insights, and the findings on the Pgp knock-out mouse were directly translated into the situation in humans. Moreover, this mouse has become a mainstay in the assessment of the impact of PGP on the PK of hundreds of drugs. Recently MRP2 and MRP3, two ABC transporters that are members of the MRP family of drug efflux pumps, have been implicated in these processes. MRP2 is localized to the same apical sites of drug uptake and elimination as is PGP (gut, hepatocytes, kidney and placenta), has the ability to transport a broad range of anticancer agents, and is known to be a factor in the hepatobiliary extrusion of several noncancer agents. In combination, these features suggest that MRP2 may be an important determinant of the PK and disposition of anticancer agents. However, its impact on cancer chemotherapeutics has not been determined in any detail. MRP3, which is able to transport etoposide and methotrexate, is localized on the basolateral surfaces of gut enterocytes, and is induced at basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes during conditions of liver dysfunction (cholestasis) in which the canalicular route of drug detoxification is blocked. These features suggest that MRP3 may promote oral bioavailability of anticancer agents, and possibly detoxify cholestatic hepatocytes by pumping cancer agents back into sinusoidal blood. Here again, the contribution of MRP3 to these processes has not been determined. To define the contribution of MRP2 and MRP3 to PK and drug disposition, we have developed mrp2 and mrp3 gene-disrupted mice, as well as a complete set of relevant double knock-out mice. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that these two pumps affect PK and drug disposition of anticancer agents by using these mouse models. Public Health Statement: Understanding the processes investigated in this proposal will promote public health by providing information that could help to improve the design of anticancer agents. These improvements could potentially allow the drugs to be given by mouth instead of intravenously, and also reduce the side effects that are associated with the way the body disposes of anticancer agents.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term objective is to understand the host factors that regulate the systemic inflammation and pathogenesis of sepsis, which affects 750,000 persons every year in United States alone and causes high mortality worldwide. We recently discovered a novel host factor, nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) that plays a critical role in determining susceptibility to sepsis by regulating a compensatory pathway that controls the induction of protective cellular antioxidants. Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant genes including the glutathione pathway and heme oxygenase in response to oxidative and inflammatory stress. Global disruption of Nrf2 (Nrf2 -/-) dramatically decreased survival after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and endotoxin treatment relative to wild-type mice (Nrf2 +/+). We hypothesize that Nrf2 regulates a host compensatory mechanism that causes transcriptional induction of antioxidant genes, which determines survival during sepsis. Disruption of Nrf2-dependent compensatory antioxidant pathways increases mortality by exaggerating the innate immune response and predisposing lymphocytes to increase apoptosis. This proposal will shed light on the Nrf2-dependent regulation of immunopathogenesis of sepsis and survival after CLP and strives to develop an intervention strategy targeting Nrf2 with a novel small-molecule activator. Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that Nrf2 determines survival after CLP by protecting against deregulation of innate immune response by maintaining cellular redox balance. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that Nrf2 improves survival after CLP by attenuating apoptosis of lymphocytes. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis of intervening sepsis by increasing Nrf2 activity with a small-molecule activator. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis remains poorly understood. Nrf2 provides a novel link between the regulation of oxidative stress, the innate immune response.and survival during sepsis. These studies may lead to the development of novel strategies based on Nrf2 for intervening in sepsis and improving survival.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) is a serious complication of diabetes and carries up to a five-fold increased risk of mortality. This high mortality rate is related in large part to silent myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardio-respiratory instability. Despite its relationship to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and its association with significant morbidity, the importance of DAN is not fully appreciated and it frequently goes undiagnosed. A major reason for this is that whilst severe symptomatic DAN is relatively uncommon, many people have sub-clinical or asymptomatic DAN. Early detection of this disorder might lead to a better prognosis for people with diabetes, by the deployment of interventions which will slow or possibly even reverse its progression. However, unlike other microvascular complications, there is currently no simple test or biomarker that would allow for screening large numbers of people. It has also limited the study of the natural history of the disorder and the impact of interventions in large-scale prospective trials. Dynamic pupillography and spectral analysis of heart rate variability are safe, noninvasive, quick and easy techniques that may allow for more widespread assessment and earlier detection of autonomic dysfunction both in the research and clinical setting. They result in a variety of different measures that may act as novel biomarkers for different types and stages of autonomic neuropathy. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess the usefulness of these different techniques by comparing them with standard cardiovascular reflex tests for the assessment of autonomic neuropathy. It will comprise of 5 groups (n=20 in each) consisting of: people with diabetes and (1) symptomatic autonomic neuropathy; (2) asymptomatic autonomic neuropathy; (3) sub-clinical autonomic neuropathy; (4) no autonomic neuropathy and (5) healthy volunteers. Also, analysis of the results will provide the range of variation for the analysed parameters among the different groups of subjects studied and allow for refinement and standardisation of these techniques.',\n",

Simon, M.D., to become an independent researcher in vaccinology. It will provide Dr. Simon the support, training, and mentoring to contribute to the identification of novel immunologic correlates of protection in shigellosis. Shigella is an intracellular Gram-negative bacillus that infects 165 million people per year and kills over 1 million, most of whom are children less than 5 years of age in the developing world. Natural immunity occurs, and promising candidate vaccines have been developed. The correlates of long-term protection in natural and vaccine-induced immunity are only partially defined, however, a fact that has delayed the development of effective vaccines. The long-term objective of this research is to contribute to the identification of immunologic correlates of protection in shigellosis with the ultimate goal to accelerate Shigella vaccine development. Specific Aim 1: Expand a currently active case control study in Colina, Chile, to include blood draws to isolate cells and serum as well as stool immunology to compare the immune response to Shigella infection of symptomatic cases with asymptomatically infected controls. Specific aim 2: Perform a challenge study with homologous Shigella flexneri 2a as well as heterologous Shigella flexneri 3a serotypes in healthy adult volunteers previously vaccinated with Shigella flexneri 2a candidate vaccine and compare the immune response of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. By comparing the immune response of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals infected with Shigella, we will be able to assess our hypothesis that the mechanism for immunologic protection in Shigella infection is primarily mediated by fecal IgA secretion and Shigella-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical trials have highlighted the importance of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. Yet, as with all prolonged drug therapy, resistance does develop via a currently unknown mechanism. This lab hypothesizes that resistance to aromatase inhibitors does entail an alternate signaling pathway that allows cells to adapt to the presence of the inhibitor, but still undergo normal cell proliferation. To address this question, this lab has generated MCF-7aro (aromatase overexpressed) breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to aromatase inhibitors and the anti-estrogen tamoxifen. 1. To investigate candidate genes involved in resistance to aromatase inhibitors, this lab intends to perform microarray analysis of the MCF-7aro resistant cell lines. 2. To better understand how genes identified by microarray are involved in resistance to aromatase inhibitors, further mechanistic studies will be done, by gene overexpression or knockdown in cell culture and analysis of activated signal transduction pathways. This project has critical clinical implications in that the effective treatment of breast carcinomas does rely on understanding drug-resistance at the molecular level.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a disease highly prevalent in North Africa and Middle East that is caused by Leishmania major.  The TMRC program has three main goals :1-Describe the natural history of L. major infection as expressed in an endemic area especially with regard to asymptomatic infection .disease severity and risk of disease recurrence; 2-Analyse the respective roles of factors specific of the vector(sand fly saliva ),or the parasite(intraspecies polymorphism) or the host immune response(innate or adaptative), in the clinical expression of ZCL with special emphasis on the identification of immune correlates of protection against primoinfection, disease occurrence or recurrence; 3-Reinforce the application of Good Epidemiological Clinical and Laboratory Practices at all levels of programme implementation.  In order to reach these goals, we shall conduct a large clinical prospective survey in a region endemic for ZCL. All enrolled individuals will be extensively investigated, clinically and immunologically, in order to accurately define their clinical history with regard to leishmania infection (including LST reactivity) as well as their in vitro immune responses to vector saliva components and parasite antigens at baseline Then an active detection of all ZCL cases, that will emerge among the cohort members will be conducted during the two following years .Leishmania isolates that could be grown from active lesions will be extensively investigated at the functional level in order to identify intraspecies diversity due to differential expression of virulence factors.  The study will draw a picture of the natural history of L major infection in the region. In addition the clinical, immunological and parasitological informations generated by the program will be integrated into a multiparametric analysis. This will permit to identify immune correlates of protection that take into consideration the eventual effects of intraspecies functional polymorphism of L major and reservoir diversity. These data are of crucial importance for the development and evaluation of effective vaccines or antileishmanial drugs.      PROJECT 1: L. major infection: Natural History and Determinants of Resistance (Ben Salah, A.)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Determinants of susceptibility/resistance and natural history of L. major infection in endemic foci include environmental and host related risk factors. Our long term goal is to elucidate the natural history of L. major infection and to weight the relative importance of host related risk factors of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) emergence and severity considering the confounding effect of environmental factors influencing exposure. The specific hypothesis is that the natural history of L. major infection and the clinical expression of cutaneous leishmaniasis varies according to past history of transmission and to the type of biotope in the study area. Host related immunological surrogates of protection other than leishmanin skin test (LST) prior to transmission might explain resistance to the disease and might be used as efficacy criteria in the context of vaccines' evaluation in the field. Based on these observations the focus of project 1 is to refine by a prospective cohort population based study the estimation of the epidemetric parameters and clinical description of disease and transmission dynamics to improve the understanding of natural history of Leishmania (L.) major infection and its determinants. The specific aims are to:    1. Elucidate epidemetric parameters of L. major infection. We will use leishmanin skin test (LST) and clinical observations, the incidence of CL versus asymptomatic infection (LST???) in a two years prospective study in order to determine: i) the prevalence of LST positivity, ii) the rate of conversion and reversion of LST, iii) the incidence of symptomatic / asymptomatic infection, iv) the score severity of disease, v) the rate of recurrence, vi) the predictive value and the protection fraction of LST positivity.    2. To evaluate the relative importance of immune host related factors and environmental on the natural history and clinical expression of the disease. These include LST, cytotoxic immune response and antibodies against sand flies' saliva antigens, distance to colonized area by reservoirs, characteristics of dwelling and its compound, socio-economic factors and pathogenic properties of L. major isolates.    3. To develop and validate scales for severity of cutaneous lesions and quality of resulting scars. The scale items include size of the ulcer, color (hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, normal skin) and height.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease. Many patients never need treatment, whereas others have an aggressive clinical outcome with significantly reduced median survival. New treatments that can induce complete remission permit patients with poor outlook to be treated while they are still asymptomatic. However, asymptomatic patients with low tumor burden (Binet stage A) derive no benefit from treatment and should be spared the unnecessary ordeal and expense. The problem is how to distinguish those patients with aggressive disease and who are candidates for treatment from those with indolent disease who are not. ZAP-70 is an intracellular protein that is expressed in T-cells and natural killer cells, but absent in B-cells of healthy people. First evidence that presence of ZAP-70 in B-cells of patients with aggressive form of CLL was identified by Rosenwald et al. in 2001 and verified by Wiestner et al. in 2003. ZAP-70 present in B-cells is a biomarker that can accurately differentiate these two patient groups and, thus, a very important prognostic indicator. Current test methods are either not widely available or insufficiently standardized. In Phase I, we demonstrated that the Integrating Waveguide Biosensor technology can be used to detect very low concentrations of proteins and cells in buffer and various matrices by sandwich immunoassay and fluorescence detection. Detection is rapid, as fast as 20 minutes, and quantitative. In this Phase II SBIR, we will apply the biosensor to detection of ZAP-70 in B cells of patients who have been diagnosed with CLL. The level of ZAP-70 so detected will provide useful and sought-after information for physicians and patients in order to understand the stage of CLL disease and determine the appropriate timing and choice of treatment, and to confirm post-treatment minimal residual disease. Assays, instrument, and a test cartridge will be developed and tested against blood specimens from CLL patients and controls. The most common human leukemia is B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients with a slowly progressive subtype of CLL may have a normal life span and may never require treatment. Patients with the more rapidly progressive form of CLL typically progress to symptomatic disease and need chemotherapy. The principle of delaying chemotherapy until the disease has progressed is founded on the observation that chemotherapy given to all patients at diagnosis is not beneficial to all. ZAP-70 in B-cells was found to be a reliable marker of disease progression. This proposal will develop a sensitive detection for ZAP-70 in B-cells to allow the doctor to identify the patients with aggressive form of CLL and provide treatment immediately.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways of influenza infection. To accomplish this goal, we will develop state-of-the-art instrumentation for real-time fluorescence imaging of single viruses and single viral genes.  These single-particle approaches will allow us to directly visualize the cellular entry process of influenza viruses in real time, to dissect individual stages of the entry pathway(s) that may be difficult if not impossible to detect by ensemble methods, and to obtain a better understanding of the cellular entry mechanisms of influenza.  Influenza, representative of many medically important viruses, is a paradigm for understanding viral entry processes.  Influenza viruses enter cells via several steps, including (1) receptor-mediated endocytosis, (2) endocytic trafficking of the viruses to late endosomes where viral fusion with endosomes leads to the release viral genes into the cytoplasm, and (3) nuclear import of these viral genes.  Three sets of experiments are designed to investigate these viral entry steps.  Specific Aim 1: Single-particle tracking will be used to investigate the endocytosis mechanisms used by the influenza viruses.  We will address important questions including: (i) which cellular endocytic pathways are exploited by influenza to enter cells; (ii) what are the molecular characteristics of these pathways; (iii) How viruses are targeted to endocytic machinery; and/or (iv) how endocytic machinery assembles around viruses? Specific Aim 2: Single-particle tracking will be used to elucidate the endocytic trafficking of influenza viruses inside cells. We will address: (i) how viruses are transported inside cells; (ii) how viruses are trafficked between different endocytic compartments; and (iii) how viruses are sorted. Specific Aim 3: Single-particle tracking will be used to characterize the  regulated nuclear import of influenzal genes, in the form of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs).  We will address: (i) the transport mechanisms of vRNPs in cells and (ii) the molecular mechanisms that regulate the nuclear import of vRNPs?  The above experiments promise to provide new insights into the cellular entry process of influenza viruses.  The new methodology developed here can be extended to study other families of viruses and may in the future lead to new designs of anti-viral drugs and therapeutics.  These techniques can also be applied to other molecular and cellular biological systems.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a growing public health issue in Poland. Its ecologic determinants and individual risk factors are poorly understood, despite growing number of studies published in Europe in the recent years. In Poland no research projects studying risk factors for TBE have been performed at the national level. Objective: To examine the association of factors related to vector ticks activity and factors related to the probability of tick/human contact with TBE incidence rates at the commune, lowest administrative level of Poland; to develop a predictive model of TBE incidence in Poland; and to study risk factors for TBE using a case-control design. Methods, design: We will perform a preliminary, ecologic study at the commune level of analysis utilizing existing data on TBE from 2,950 cases reported in 1993- 2006 and several ecologic variables obtained for the commune level. These ecologic variables will be: Lyme disease incidence rate, percent of commune area covered by forests, forest types prevalent in a commune, monthly air temperatures, monthly air humidity, monthly rainfall, measures of environmental pollution, and socio-economic status of commune inhabitants. A secondary, case-control study will utilize all cases reported in Poland in a year period. Three control subjects will be selected for each case, frequency matched by age, gender and district of residence. Each control subject will be serologically tested to exclude asymptomatic TBE. The association between exposure and disease will be compared between TBE cases and subjects free of TBE. If the number of asymptomatic TBE cases will be sufficient, an additional comparison between asymptomatic TBE cases and subjects free of TBE will be carried out. The risk factors studied will include visit to area with high risk for TBE, outdoor activities, socio-economic status. This project is aimed to identify population-level and individual-level risk factors related to tick-borne encephalitis, which is a serious problem in Poland. By establishing risk for disease both in areas endemic for the disease and non-endemic, as well as assessment of individual disease risk factors, well targeted public health interventions will be possible using safe and effective prophylaxis and education.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout the world, 12 million people acquire syphilis every year. About one-third reside in sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportion of individuals with syphilis is 2-3 times higher in those who are HIV-infected compared to those who are not. In the US, compared to all patients with primary and secondary syphilis, rates of primary and secondary syphilis are 80 times higher in patients who are HIV-infected. Development of early neurosyphilis is more common in HIV-infected individuals than in those who are not HIV infected. Early neurosyphilis causes substantial morbidity, including symptomatic meningitis, hearing loss, vertigo, and visual loss. Neurosyphilis begins with asymptomatic meningitis. Untreated, asymptomatic neurosyphilis can lead to symptomatic neurosyphilis. Identification and treatment of the ~25% of HIV-infected patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis would prevent them from progressing to symptomatic disease. However, there is currently no sensitive and specific test to identify these individuals. One approach to this problem would be to perform a lumbar puncture on all HIV-infected patients with syphilis. However this approach is impractical in many settings and potentially wastes resources. In this application, we build upon our previous work in a cohort of 556 HIV-infected subjects with syphilis to develop and validate algorithms to 1) determine which HIV- infected patients with syphilis should undergo lumbar puncture and 2) interpret CSF abnormalities. These algorithms will be constructed using a novel statistical method called classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Further, we will determine the impact of concomitant antiretroviral therapy, and of particular antiretroviral agents within a regimen, on response to neurosyphilis therapy. Our study is unique. It is the only study of neurosyphilis conducted in the HIV era. Neurosyphilis carries significant morbidity in HIV-infected patients. The studies proposed in this application will yield the necessary tools for clinicians to optimally evaluate, treat and manage HIV-infected patients with syphilis and neurosyphilis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Syphilis, a disease that many thought was more or less controlled, is enjoying a major come back in the developed world and remains endemic in the developing world. Many of those infected also have HIV, and they are at increased risk of a complication called neurosyphilis, which can cause blindness, deafness and stroke within weeks after syphilis infection. Our proposed research builds on our previous work and will lead to ways to better diagnose and treat neurosyphilis.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, particularly the discovery and development of compounds that are active against virus isolates resistant to currently approved therapies. During my pre-academic career, we reported on 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl) betulinic acid (PA-457), first in a new class of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors with efficacy against strains resistant to current therapies. Unlike protease inhibitors, PA-457 blocks a single step in the processing of the viral Gag protein: protease cleavage of the Gag capsid (CA) precursor (CA-SP1) to mature CA protein. This results in the release of immature, non-infectious viral particles, and also raises several interesting questions about the mechanism of action, molecular determinants, and identity of molecular target for this novel HIV-1 inhibitor. I would like these questions along with the development of additional maturation inhibitors to be the center of my career research. I would like to establish myself as a productive scientist in retrovirus maturation, a relatively unexplored research area. Work by our group and others has demonstrated that residues within the HIV-1 Gag CA-SP1 boundary region serve as determinants of PA-457 activity, and genetic variation within this region allows HIV-1 to escape PA-457-mediated inhibition. More recent results support the theory that a direct interaction between the compound and an oligomeric form of Gag is critical to PA-457 activity. While these observations allow insight into the PA-457 antiviral effect, the mechanisms of action and resistance of PA-457 remain to be fully determined. We propose to further characterize the mechanism of action of PA-457 activity and further elucidate the molecular determinants of PA-457 activity. We believe that the results of our studies will provide greater insight into the mechanisms of action and resistance of PA-457 as well as into the precise molecular determinant of PA-457 activity. A better understanding of these issues is particularly relevant due to PA-457's ongoing clinical development (currently in Phase 2b trial). We are confident that the results of these studies will aid in the development of additional classes of HIV-1 maturation inhibitors and help elucidate the basic mechanism of HIV-1 maturation. Lay Language: Drug resistance is the leading reason for HIV treatment failure. Completion of the proposed research will help identify novel HIV maturation inhibitors, provide additional treatment options, and improve disease outcome.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to delineate the dynamic host-virus interactions during HIV-1 replication and use this information to develop novel and effective strategies to combat AIDS. INI1/hSNF5, is a HIV-1 integrase (IN) binding host factor, is a component of the mammalian chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex involved in transcriptional regulation. INI1/hSNF5 directly and strongly binds to HIV-1 IN and a fragment of INI1/hSNF5, spanning the minimal IN-binding domain, dominant negatively inhibits HIV-1 replication. These observations suggested that INI1/hSNF5 interaction is required for HIV-1 replication. Recent studies demonstrate that INI1/hSNF5 is a tumor suppressor, biallelically mutated in rhabdoid tumors. Our attempt to study global gene expression profile revealed that INI1/hSNF5 stimulates a high degree of IFN signal induced genes (ISGs) and PML nuclear body proteins in INI1-/- rhabdoid cells. These results shed new insight on the role of INI1/hSNF5 in HIV-1 replication. We hypothesize that INI1 is a component of the cellular anti-viral defense (innate immunity) and is required for induction of IFN signaling during HIV-1 replication and that HIV-1 subverts the effect of INI1/hSNF5 by directly binding to it via IN and capturing it during its replication. To test this hypothesis, in the specific aim I we will determine if INI1/hSNF5 is required for inducing IFN signaling in T cells by IFNs, poly(I):(C) and during HIV-1 replication. We will monitor the induction of antiviral genes (e.g. IFIT1, IFITM1, OAS2, MX2 and PKR), PML nuclear body components (e.g. PML, Sp100, Sp110), and signal transducers (e.g. STAT1). We will correlate the effect of down-modulation of INI1 and ISG expression to HIV-1 replication. These results will establish if INI1/hSNF5 is a component of the cellular antiviral defense during HIV-1 replication. In the specific aim II we will determine if HIV-1 subverts the INI1-induced antiviral defense by capturing it via binding by IN. We will: (i) use a mutant HIV-1 virion harboring INI1-interaction-defective IN mutants (H12Y) and a transdominant mutant of INI1 (S6); determine if IN-mutants H12Y will be unable to capture INI1 and allow the IFN signaling; (ii) determine if S6 sequesters IN and allows cellular INI1 to mount IFN signaling and compare the effect S6 to an IN-interaction defective mutant of S6 (E3); (iii) To determine if IN within the context of Gag-Pol is able to sequester INI1, we will investigate the temporal relationship between expression of Gag-Pol, ISG expression and redistribution of endogenous INI1 during late events of HIV-1 replication. If Gag-Pol expression is able to sequester cellular INI1 in the cytoplasm, then this will lead to subversion of the ISG expression during HIV-1 replication. These results will shed light on the mechanism by which HIV-1 may subvert INI1-induced cellular antiviral defense. We hope that together the above two specific aims will establish a new paradigm in dynamic host-HIV-1 interaction and may provide insight for developing novel antiviral and vaccine strategies against AIDS. AIDS is still a major health problem because of the inability of current drugs to eliminate HIV-1 due to the emergence of the resistant viruses. Therefore, there is a dire need for identification of new targets and development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat AIDS. There is a dynamic interaction between host and the virus during pathogenesis. The aim of this application is to test a novel hypotheses that INI1/hSNF5, a cellular protein that binds to one of the HIV-1 proteins (integrase), is a component of the cellular antiviral defense and utilize this insight for developing novel antiviral strategies against AIDS in the future.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As the AIDS pandemic continues, the emergence of HIV variants that are drug resistant is a therapeutic challenge. The nine FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitors are currently the most potent of the anti-viral drugs in the treatment of HIV infected patients. All of these inhibitors were the results of structure based drug design. Yet variants of HIV protease have evolved which are resistant to one or more of these drugs. Even within a single patient an ensemble of different viruses and therefore proteases exist. The challenge for the community is to develop HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are robust and therefore less vulnerable to drug resistance. This is a multi-disciplinary challenge, as two key thrusts must be addressed - both the underlying mechanisms of resistance must be elucidated and new strategies for identifying robust inhibitors against resistance must be developed. This project aims to address this challenge by a comprehensive approach that integrates clinical data, structural biology and biophysical chemistry, medical informatics and biostatistics, biochemistry and molecular virology, computational chemistry and computer-aided design, and synthetic and medicinal chemistry. With this integrated program we plan to address two global research objectives: 1. Elucidate the role of compensatory mutations in HIV-1 protease in conferring drug resistance 2. Develop new HIV-1 protease inhibitors that are more robust against drug resistance. Through this integrated approach our goal is to attain a better understanding of inhibitor recognition and to develop new methodologies for designing inhibitors against quickly evolving targets that have a propensity for acquiring drug resistance.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is standard practice for kidney transplant candidates, who are asymptomatic but at high risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE; nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization for symptoms and cardiac death), to undergo non-invasive cardiac stress testing and/or coronary angiography. Candidates who are found to have significant coronary disease then undergo preemptive angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent posttransplant MACE. Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that this strategy may be ineffective, and there may be substantial human and financial costs. Transplants are often delayed. The cardiac screening and intervention procedures themselves may result in morbidity and even mortality. Patients hoping to undergo transplantation without starting maintenance dialysis may need to start dialysis as a result of contrast nephropathy. Finally, the current standard of practice is expensive, and the cost-benefit ratio is unknown. This two-year development proposal will take steps necessary for conducting a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and costs of screening candidates for living donor kidney transplantation who are asymptomatic, but high risk for MACE. The proposed trial will randomly allocate candidates to either standard care or care that does not include routine non-invasive stress testing and/or coronary angiography for asymptomatic patients, but follows American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for noncardiac surgery. All patients will received optimal medical management, including perioperative beta-blockade according to ACC/AHA guidelines. Only candidates for living donor kidney transplants will be included, since the waiting time for deceased donor kidneys is often several years. The primary endpoint will be MACE. The development phase of this proposal will enroll centers that 1) perform adequate numbers of living donor transplants, 2) screen asymptomatic patients with non-invasive stress testing and/or coronary angiography using uniform selection criteria (e.g. history of prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and/or age =50 years), and 3) are able to obtain institutional approvals to conduct the proposed randomized trial. The development phase will also include a survey of potential trial participants to assess their willingness to participate in the randomized trial. Finally, the development phase will test statistical methodologies for using Medicare claims data, and data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the subset of patients in the randomized trial for whom Medicare is the primary payer. All of these steps will provide the information needed to proceed with the randomized trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If it is determined that screening asymptomatic candidates for kidney transplantation with stress testing and/or coronary angiography does not improve outcomes, there could be a substantial reduction in human and financial costs. Candidates would no longer need to delay transplantation and incur the risk of the procedures that are part of these routine cardiac evaluations. The money spent on these procedures might be better directed to health care measures of proven efficacy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A clearer understanding of risk factors for brain injury in early HIV infection is critical for rational intervention and neuroprotection efforts. Quantitative Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging methodologies can be used to generate objective measurements of the brain at different levels of analysis. This investigation will exploit these noninvasive technologies to systematically quantify brain injury in HIV patients in early stages of infection in order to identify factors associated with increased risk of neurological progression. The focus of this investigation concerns activated monocytes in the peripheral circulation and factors that influence monocyte trafficking (TNFa and MCP-1, in plasma, CSF). Immunologic (CD4+ and CD8+) and virologic (HIV RNA in plasma, CSF) factors will also be evaluated. These potential determinants of neurological progression will be evaluated for patterns of relationship to objective measurements of brain injury and cognitive impairment in HIV patients in early (within 6 months of seroconversion) and asymptomatic HIV infection. All subjects will be evaluated at baseline and at a follow-up assessment, two years post-baseline. Automated segmentation algorithms will be used to derive volume fractions of the normalized brain parenchyma and of specific tissue classes (gray matter, white matter and CSF). Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) will be used to measure microstructural changes in the whole brain and in specific regions that are vulnerable to injury in HIV patients, including the basal ganglia and deep white matter. The bone marrow will also be interrogated with quantitative MR methodologies. The latter imaging studies are motivated by evidence that immune activation in the marrow influences monocyte trafficking to the brain, as well as HIV replication, and therefore may represent a critical determinant of neurological injury. The in vivo marrow measurements will be examined for the degree of relationship to brain injury and neurocognitive impairment. The histological significance of these measurements will be evaluated with respect to levels of activated monocytes in the peripheral circulation and marrow biopsy findings of monocyte expansion and hypercellularity. Magnetic Resonance techniques for measuring the brain will be used to determine if injury occurs in early HIV infection. These techniques will also be used to determine whether specific factors are associated with changes in the brain in early and asymptomatic stages of HIV infection. Changes occurring in the bone marrow will also be studied as indicators of increased risk of brain injury in HIV patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The budding of retroviruses is dependent upon small L-domain sequences encoded in their Gag polyproteins that serve as binding sites for cellular proteins involved in endosomal sorting (ESCRT-I, -II, -III). These cell proteins provide the mechanical means for virus-like particles to release from the plasma membrane. Depending upon the retrovirus, three different L domains are used, individually or in combination. To understand the nature of these protein complexes, Gag polyproteins from avian sarcoma (ASV), human immunodeficiency, type I, (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia (MuLV) viruses will be isolated from cells under native conditions, associated cell proteins fractionated by two-dimensional chromatography, and those that bind to Gag in an L-domain dependent fashion will be identified by mass spectrographic techniques. This will define those cellular proteins that are shared or not. By analysis of complexes derived from wild type and Gag containing L-domain deletions but fused to specific ESCRT-I, -II, -III proteins that rescue or not the budding defect, the entry points for each virus into the budding pathway will be elucidated. Both ASV and MuLV Gag use related but different PPxY L-domain motifs, which are specific binding sites for E3 ubiquitin ligases. These motifs will be exchanged between ASV and MuLV Gag polyproteins to demonstrate that this changes the specificity for the E3 protein used in the budding process. Site directed mutagenesis of residues that differ between related PY motifs and siRNA phenotypic depletion inside of cells targeting different E3 proteins will also be carried out to establish their mechanistic role in the budding process. The possible function of the C2 transport domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4, will be examined for a role in transport of ASV Gag to the cell surface. Finally, a series of known ubiquitin mutants will be analyzed for their effect on Gag release. Taken together, these experiments will provide important new information about the mechanism of budding and suggest cellular targets for the development of antiviral agents that disrupt the viral budding process. Retroviruses may be less likely to develop drug resistance to such agents than to drugs that target viral encoded enzymes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The mechanism of budding from cells of three different retroviruses will be compared using biochemical proteomics and site directed mutagenesis techniques. These studies will lay the basic foundation for understanding an essential process in viral replication and suggest targets for the development of antiviral agents for which retroviruses may be less likely to develop drug resistance variants.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eipstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of all humans, usually without symptoms. It can also be responsible for acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM) and is associated with fatal malignancies including immunoblastic lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and X-linked proliferative disorder (XLP). Our long-term goal is to understand these processes in sufficient detail to guide clinical intervention. Our overall model of normal and malignant EBV biology puts us in a good position to build computer models of EBV infection. Our specific aims include the following: Evaluate the relative impacts of various factors known to play a role in EBV biology. Assess the probability of the varying fates of a cell once it has entered a particular infected state. Understand the overall dynamics of these models as dynamical systems. This includes distinguishing possible long-term behaviors and the transitory states that lead to them. We will pursue these goals by building and analyzing multiple light weight computer models of EBV infection. By  light weight  we mean that these models are easy to write, modify and run. This will allow investigations not possible with larger agent-based computer models. Epstein-Barr Virus is widespread in the human population. While it is usually asymptomatic, it is also associated with fatal malignancies. Computer simulation is a way to study the normal asymptomatic course of this infection and the ways in which this turns malignant. We hope that a better understanding of these processes will show us how they can be controlled.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Christine Johnston completed Infectious Diseases fellowship and an MPH degree in epidemiology at the University of Washington in 2007. This proposal describes a 5 year training program which will allow her to develop an independent academic career in clinical research studying genital herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection, and will build on prior experiences studying host-viral interactions and herpesvirus replication at mucosal surfaces. Drs. Anna Wald and Lawrence Corey are internationally renowned leaders in clinical HSV-2 research and are co-mentors for this award.    HSV-2 is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection worldwide and has emerged as a significant risk factor for acquisition and transmission of HIV. HSV-2 transmission most frequently occurs during periods of asymptomatic genital shedding. Our group has recently used intensive sampling (swabbing the genital surfaces 4 times per day) to demonstrate that the majority of genital shedding episodes last less than 12 hours, suggesting a frequent reactivation rate from the ganglia and a brisk peripheral immune response. Preliminary data indicate that subclinical shedding may occur simultaneously at several genital locations and that  short bursts  of HSV-2 replication occur in the presence of suppressive antiviral therapy. These data suggest that 1) we may have overestimated the degree of suppression provided by antiviral therapy and 2) genital mucosal responses are essential for control of HSV-2 replication. To evaluate  short bursts  of shedding, a cohort of 50 HSV-2 seropositive persons on suppressive antiviral therapy will obtain genital swabs 4 times per day for 60 days. The rate and duration of HSV-2 shedding episodes will be compared with rates off therapy (Aim 1). For Aims 2 & 3,15 HSV-2 seropositive people not on therapy (Aim 2) and 15 persons on suppressive therapy (Aim 3) will be seen daily over a 30 day period to capture episodes of asymptomatic shedding, using a novel rapid HSV PCR test. Genital biopsies will be performed within hours of HSV-2 detection. Gene expression patterns using microarrays and HSV specific T-cell function will be evaluated. Results will be compared to biopsies obtained from the same participants in the presence of genital lesions. These studies will help us understand HSV-2 pathogenesis and the responses mediating viral clearance, which will inform therapeutic strategies to prevent the epidemic spread of HSV-2 and HIV.',\n",
       " 'Our long-term programmatic goal is to develop screening strategies to diagnose asymptomatic pancreaticcancer (PaC). Up to 80% of PaCs have hyperglycemia and diabetes (DM), which is evident many monthsprior to the cancer diagnosis and improves following resection of PaC. Conversely, older subjects with newonsetDM have a ~8 fold higher risk of having PaC compared to the general population. Recognition ofnew-onset DM as an early manifestation of PaC could lead to diagnosis of asymptomatic early stagePaC. In this proposal we take our strong and consistent clinical and epidemiological observations to thelaboratory to understand the pathogenesis of PaC-associated DM (PaCDM) and identify its biomarkers.Specific Aim 1: To determine if B-cell dysfunction is an early and key defect in PaCDM: DM occurs ininsulin resistant states when B-cells fail to compensate for impaired insulin action. The very high prevalenceof DM in PaC implies high rate of B-cell failure. We have developed a technique in humans to simultaneouslyassess B-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic insulin extraction using 3 radiolabeled glucose tracers.We have used this technique to study subjects with type 2 DM, impaired glucose tolerance and normalglucose tolerance. We will perform similar studies in PaC to determine if B-cell dysfunction is an early andkey defect in glucose metabolism in PaCDM. Specific Aim 2: To determine if adrenomedullin (AM) is themediator of PaCDM: AM is a 52 amino acid peptide hormone expressed in normal human islets that inhibitsinsulin exocytosis from B-cells. It is markedly overexpressed in PaC and its plasma levels are increased inPaCDM. We hypothesize thai AM is the mediator of B-cell dysfunction in PaC. In preliminary studies wehave been able to  transmit  DM from a human to SCID mice using a xenograft of PaC from a patient withPaCDM, while a xenograft of PaC from a patient with normal fasting glucose had no effect on glucose levels.In in vitro studies using INS-1, an insulinoma cell line, we have observed that PaC cell lines inhibit glucosemediatedinsulin release. Using genetic and pharmacological methods to modulate the expression andaction of AM in these in vivo and in vitro models, we will investigate the role of AM in causing PaCDM.Specific Aim 3: To develop a predictive model for PaC among new-onset diabetics: PaCDM isassociated not only with high plasma AM levels, but also with older age, obesity and family history of DM.We will measure plasma AM, insulin and glucose levels as well as CA 19-9, the best known tumor marker ofPaC, in a large cohort (n=420) of subjects with PaC with and without new-onset DM, new-onset type 2 DM,and healthy and disease controls. We will determine the performance characteristics of AM as a biomarkerof PaCDM and develop a predictive model for PaC using laboratory, clinical and demographic predictivefactors. Translational Significance: If a biomarker of PaC-induced DM is identified it will have immediateclinical impact as it will allow us to start screening for asymptomatic PaC in the subjects with new-onset DM.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the failure of all clinical trials with cytoprotective therapy in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), new candidate therapy should have a pleiotropic effect which corresponds to the complex profile of ICH pathogenesis. Here, we propose that nuclear factor-erythroid E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a pleiotropic protein that regulates transcription of a battery of key cytoprotective, detoxifying, and phagocytosis-regulating genes represents a promising target for ICH therapy. Preliminary data suggest: (1) Cytoprotection: Activators of Nrf2 after ICH in rodents reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and protect brain cells from damage, while Nrf2 gene deletion has the opposite effect; (2) Hematoma resolution: Activators of Nrf2 promote phagocytosis by brain microglia/macrophages and accelerate hematoma resolution in mice after ICH. This process is linked to Nrf2-mediated CD36 scavenger receptor expression, since blocking Nrf2 and CD36 inhibits phagocytosis by microglia. In addition, Nrf2-mediated clearance of neurotoxic hemoglobin could be through Nrf2- driven haptoglobin (Hp) expression, as Nrf2-activation improves, and severe hypohaptoglobinemia retards hemoglobin clearance after ICH. Thus, the overall hypothesis is that Nrf2 is a viable target in protecting the brain from damage during the both early and late stages of ICH pathology. Three Specific Aims (SA) are included: (SA1) investigates Nrf2 as a regulator of cytoprotection and inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage in an ICH-like in vitro model. We will subject primary neurons or microglia to  ICH-like  environment and establish its consequences: cell death, oxidative stress, inflammatory response (microglia). Next, we will establish the cytoprotective role of Nrf2 (including preservation of phagocytotic functions) by using cells from Nrf2 deficient mice, DNA decoy to inhibit Nrf2, gene transfer to overexpress Nrf2, and pharmacologic agents to activate Nrf2. (SA2) Investigate Nrf2 as a mechanism to promote hematoma resolution after ICH. We will use Nrf2-, CD36-, and Hp-deficient mice (or microglia isolated from these mice) to explore the role of Nrf2 and its downstream targets, as well as CD36 and Hp, in hematoma resolution and their impact on secondary brain damage. (SA3) Investigate the clinical utility of sulforaphane (Nrf2 activator) as a treatment for ICH. We will use blood injection model of ICH in mouse to optimize conditions for the treatment of ICH with SF. We will first establish an optimal therapeutic dose with respect to the highest efficiency, safety, duration of treatment, and longest time window for effective treatment for ICH in mice. Our long term goal is to explore pharmacological and molecular therapies that will reduce ICH pathogenesis and improve functional recovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 10 to 15% of all strokes and has a one-year mortality rate greater than 50-60%. There is no FDA approved effective treatment for ICH. In our study, we will determine if activation of transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates expression of many genes that increase resistance of brain cells to ICH- induced damage, may represent a viable target for ICH treatment. Our goal is to explore the underlying molecular mechanism of Nrf2's beneficial effect, and to establish the initial pharmacologic criteria for therapies using Nrf2-based approach.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagasic cardiomyopathy emerges in 30-40% of the patients infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, and accounts for >50,000 deaths and the loss of 2.74 million disability-adjusted life years per year. By the time most patients are diagnosed with Chagas disease, heart dysfunction has been progressing for many years. Available anti-parasite drug therapies are toxic and largely ineffective during the clinical disease phase. We do not yet know the molecular mechanisms that are disturbed in susceptible patients who will proceed to develop clinical cardiac disease. In recent preclinical and clinical studies, we have shown that T. cruzi-infected hosts sustain an oxidative stress of an inflammatory and mitochondrial origin, and oxidative pathology of the heart plays an important role in eliciting cardiac dysfunction during progressive Chagas disease. Further, we have found that distinct plasma proteins are oxidized/nitrated in acute and chronic chagasic animals, and these proteins are different from those modified in the plasma of animals with cardiomyopathy of other etiologies. These observations support our hypothesis that pathological processes leading to the development of chagasic cardiomyopathy in patients would cause characteristic changes in the concentration/oxidation of proteins in the blood and generate a detectable disease-specific molecular phenotype. In this study, we propose to develop a plasma oxidative proteome in chagasic patients. In aim 1, we would utilize a ProteomeLab PF2D liquid chromatography system to identify the changes in the plasma proteome of chagasic subjects and compare them to findings in normal/healthy and other cardiomyopathy subjects. In aim 2, we would identify the oxidative modifications in the plasma proteome of Chagasic patients. For this purpose, we have enhanced the PF2D system by adding an in-line photodiode array spectrophotometer that allows us to visualize the post-translational modifications at their signature wavelength. Proteins that are differentially expressed/oxidized in a disease-specific manner will be identified by LC-MS/MS and validated by western blotting. Upon completion of these studies, we anticipate identifying molecular markers that will be useful in classification of the Chagas disease state and diagnosis of those asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of developing chronic, dilated cardiomyopathy. By biological analysis of the differentially expressed/modified proteome data, we will identify the interlocking pathways and co-regulated sub-networks that are dysregulated during progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic clinical disease. These disturbed networks will suggest why and when infected individuals become susceptible to Chagas disease and yield novel targets for engineering the combination therapies for the prevention and treatment of chagasic, and possibly other cardiomyopathies. PUBLIC RELEVANCE: The studies in this project are aimed at developing the Chagas disease-associated plasma oxidative proteome. Upon completion of these studies, we will identify molecular markers of patient's disease state and patient's susceptibility to develop Chagas disease and the molecular disturbances that enhance the risk of clinical disease development in asymptomatic individuals. These studies will yield potential targets for the development of new drug therapies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have developed a new mouse model that demonstrates that the sex of a litter carried by a mouse dam can affect social behavior and sensorimotor processing in her subsequent offspring. Mouse dams are implanted with a litter of all male embryos or a litter of all female embryos and allowed to carry this first litter to term and wean the offspring. The dams are then mated to produce a second litter consisting of both sexes. We find that males in the second generation display differences in behavior depending on whether all their older siblings were brothers or sisters. Many of these behavioral differences are reminiscent of autism spectrum disorder in humans. Compared to male mice with older sisters, male mice with older brothers display an exaggerated startle response, inappropriate social interactions, avoidance of novel objects, and difficulty in auditory processing. Each of these behaviors represent an important component of autism spectrum disorder in humans. Thus we may have stumbled upon a previously unsuspected risk factor for autism in males: the number of older brothers. In addition, the effect of older brothers on the development of subsequent brothers may represent a contributing factor to the greater incidence of other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ADD and dyslexia, in boys than in girls. We would like to explore our mouse model for this  fraternal birth order  (FBO) effect. Understanding how older brothers affect behaviors in our mice may shed light on how other factors (including genes and toxin) might lead to neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. We will investigate possible mechanisms that might underlie these phenomena, including the possibility that the maternal immune system may be directing antibodies to male-specific antigens in subsequent sons, and that maternal experience caring for pups of one sex may affect subsequent maternal care of subsequent sons.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  We will investigate a mouse model for the effects of older brothers on behaviors that typify autistic spectrum disorder. Preliminary evidence suggests that a mammalian mother that has carried a son to term may produce antibodies that attack the nervous system of subsequent sons in utero. By learning how older brothers increase autistic-like behaviors in mice, we may gain insight into the development of autism and possible therapies for this disorder.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drugs that target topoisomerase action are effective anticancer agents and a number are FDA approved. Anti-topoisomerase therapy is predicated on subverting the endogenous topoisomerase into a genotoxic, DNA damaging agent. A significant problem with such drugs is collateral damage in normal cells. Since all nucleated somatic cells retain some level topoisomerase activity (either type I and/or type II), negative outcome due to DNA damage in normal healthy tissue is unavoidable, unless novel strategies can be crafted to tune down undesirable side effects. In this SBIR, the corporate sponsor (TopoGEN, Inc.) is proposing a combinatorial strategy using `smart pharma' drug design. Potent topoisomerase poisons can be coupled to polyamines (spermine for example) which are processed preferentially by cancer cells based on elevated requirement of exogenous polyamines for cell growth. Evidence is provided that novel anti- topoisomerase/polyamine conjugates induce preferential DNA damage via endogenous topoisomerase poisoning in cells with hyperactive polyamine transport mechanisms. A library of novel polyamine compounds of this sort has been synthesized (and others are being constantly added). In this SBIR, the company will rigorously evaluate these novel compounds for topoisomerase targeting efficacy in vivo using defined model cells lines and in vitro using purified enzymes. This strategy for rational polyamine-topoisomerase drug design will reveal the most effective agents for cancer cell killing while minimizing damage to normal cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of targeted cancer therapies would be a clear advance in the treatment of cancer. Since cancer costs in the U.S. were nearly 1.4 million lives and $210 billion in 2005, it makes both medical and economic sense to invest in new pharmaceutical technologies. Smart drugs, which can selectively target and kill cancers, would begin to address this important public health issue.\",\n",
       " 'The clinical project is the translational research arm of the ProgramProject. We have ssembled the largest, fully characterized cohort of families (51) harboring mtDNA mutations. Nearly 90% (44 families)carry a A3243G mutation and the fully symptomatic probands manifest the MELAS phenotype. The family members are assigned to three clinical groups (asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic and fully symptomatic) when first evaluated. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of these subjects have provided valuable information regarding natural history. The longitudinal study, now in its 10th year, expands our understanding of the clinical phenotypes and the frequency of medical complications. Key biological variables have been identified that predict increasing morbidity in the asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic group and mortality in the fully symptomatic group. Brain ventricular lactate is the most sensitive biomarker of brain cellular metabolism. Urine sediment DNA is the most reliable measure of mtDNAmutation. Neuropsychological studies show visual memory to be the most vulnerable brain domain. Symptomatic MELAS patients are midway through a three-year, randomized DCA/placebo double-blinded study to determine whether chronic cerebral lactic acidosis contributes to brain injury. We propose three Specific Aims. Specific Aim #1 continues our natural history study correlating genotype and phenotype. This aim tests the hypothesis that brain ventricular lactate correlates with clincal phenotype and prognosis. Specific Aim #2 continues our MELAS/DCA clinical trial. This aim tests the hypothesis that chronic cerebral lactic acidosis exacerbates the MELAS phenotype. Specific Aim #3 is a new study assessing earlybiomarkers of brain dysfunction using PET, fMRI and voxel-based morphometric analysis. This aim tests the hypothesis that brain ventricular lactate correlates with brain cellular dysfunction. We anticipate that these studies will allow us to determine whether some subjects with the A3243G mutation will remain asymptomatic for the duration of their expected life (low risk group) whereas others who reveal minimal early evidence of structural/functional brain disturbances will become symptomatic and are deserving of early prophylactic treatment (high risk group).The ultimate objective of this clinical project is to find a cure for clinical syndromes associated with mtDNA point mutations.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Eliciting neutralizing Abs against the native (fusogenic) trimer of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) is problematic due to lability in the constituent subunits, gp120 and gp41, which leads to the elicitation of mainly non-neutralizing antibodies against irrelevant forms of Env. Therefore, a means of engineering and producing a stable and homogeneous preparation of native Env trimers is likely to be beneficial for HIV-1 vaccine design. Rational approaches have been met with limited success, due in part to a lack of information about the structural details of the trimer. Our approach does not strictly require detailed knowledge of Env trimer structure. In the R21 phase, in vitro mutagenesis will be employed to introduce sequence diversity into targeted regions within env, and the env `libraries' subcloned en masse into a HIV-1 expression vector for the production of `HIV-1 display Env libraries' (i.e. HIV-1 populations whose diverse members are each distinguished by a unique env gene sequence and the cognate copies of Env it displays on its surface). The HIV-1 display Env libraries will then be selected on the basis of resistance to heat, chemical denaturants and CD4-receptor destabilization, and the surviving virions rescued by infecting target cells. Multiple rounds of selection may be expected to yield HIV-1 that display native Env trimers of enhanced stability. We will also try depleting the HIV-1 Env libraries of clones that are particularly reactive with non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies while enriching for those clones with diminished display of immunodominant and irrelevant epitopes. The in vitro-selected, hyperstable HIV-1 Env variants will be used as immunogens to determine their potential as HIV-1 vaccine leads. R33 phase immunization studies will be accompanied by high precision serum Ab specificity mapping to guide Env immunogen optimization. Finally, a specifically tailored screen for soluble and natively folded gp140s will be performed that uses the stability-selected HIV-1 Env variants as input. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We aim to select mutants of HIV in which key molecules on the viral surface are more stable than that found in nature. Inactivated forms of such mutant viruses may elicit more effective immune (antibody) responses and may therefore lead to better vaccines against HIV/AIDS.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in the United States is predominantly an asymptomatic disease characterized by mild hypercalcemia and elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Over the past 24 years, this research project has defined the current clinical, biochemical, densitometric, and histomorphometric features of PHPT. The project has also led to new insights into mechanisms of bone loss, with particular reference to PTH's actions at cortical and cancellous sites. We have also begun to characterize new phenotypes of PHPT in patients who have the disorder but in whom the serum calcium concentration is normal. Some of these patients already have indications of skeletal or renal involvement. Others, similar to their mildly hypercalcemic counterparts, are asymptomatic. In the renewal period, we propose to study these normocalcemic variants of PHPT as well as to delineate further specific mechanistic elements of hypercalcemic PHPT. We will characterize neurocognitive aspects with verifiable instrumentation including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain. State of the art techniques include: novel approaches to the histomorphometric and molecular analysis of bone tissue; high resolution quantitative computed tomography; quantitative back-scattered electron imaging, Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy; finite element modeling of high resolution non-invasive imaging as well as the bone biopsy, and fMRI. With these cohorts and new technologies, we will define bone quality, bone strength and specific neurocognitive aspects of PHPT to an extent never before accomplished. We will extend these studies further to determine which abnormalities in bone quality are reversible after parathyroid surgery and how the use of an intervention to block the catabolic pathway of PTH may well unmask latent anabolic potential of PTH even in the setting of chronic exposure. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. to characterize two new cohorts of subjects with PHPT: normocalcemic symptomatic PHPT and normocalcemic asymptomatic PHPT; 2. to define abnormalities of bone quality in PHPT in both the hypercalcemic and normocalcemic variants and, in the hypercalcemic cohort, to determine their reversibility; 3. to determine bone strength in PHPT. By the end of the renewal period, we will have fully characterized the hypercalcemic and normocalcemic variants of PHPT and will have established how these various phenotypes are different from each other at the clinical, biochemical, morphometric, structural and molecular levels. We will have characterized clinical, mechanistic, biomechanical, and neurocognitive elements of this disease in its classical presentation and in its more recently recognized variants. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of PHPT and also be highly relevant to clinical management of this common metabolic bone disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder of excess parathyroid hormone secretion, is one of the most common metabolic bone diseases. The project is designed to elucidate aspects of this disorder that have been elusive, but which when characterized, will enhance our approach to the therapy of this disorder.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of death and disability in cancer patients. The incidence of VTE in these patients in further increased by the administration of anti-neoplastic drugs, such as the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin, as well as combination therapies. However, the mechanisms of VTE in cancer patients are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether an association exists between tissue factor (TF) activity in circulating microparticles (MPs) and venous thrombosis in patients with pancreatic or colon cancer, and in tumor-bearing mice. MPs are small (<1 micron) membrane vesicles that are released from activated or apoptotic cells. Our general hypothesis is that chemotherapy drugs increase the release of TF-positive MPs from both tumor cells and host cells into the circulation, and that an increase in the level of these MPs is associated with an increase in the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE in pancreatic and colon cancer patients, and an increase in thrombus size in tumor-bearing mice. The proposal is divided into two aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the effect of treatment of tumor-bearing mice with chemotherapeutic drugs on circulating TF-positive MPs derived from tumor cells and different host cells as well as their role in a model of venous thrombosis. We will measure the levels of TF activity in isolated MPs in tumor-bearing mice treated with either gemcitabine or gemcitabine and cisplatin. We will use a series of novel mouse lines to distinguish between TF-positive MPs derived from i/ tumor versus host cells, and ii/ different host cells (monocytes, endothelial cells and platelets). These include HCV mice, which express human TF in the absence of mouse TF, and mice with various cell type-specific deletions of the TF gene generated using the Cre-loxP technology. Finally, we will selectively analyze the role of either tumor cell- derived or host cell-derived TF-positive MPs in a model of venous thrombosis. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if there is an association between TF activity in circulating MPs and VTE in patients with advanced pancreatic and colon cancer treated with anti-neoplastic drugs in a multi-center prospective observational study. Blood samples will be obtained from patients before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis will be assessed using compression ultrasound before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. We will measure levels of TF activity in isolated MPs and determine if this is associated with asymptomatic and/or symptomatic VTE. We will also measure whole blood TF activity, cellular origin of the TF-positive MPs and coagulation activation markers (thrombin anti thrombin complexes and D- dimer). The results of this study will determine the role of TF-positive MPs in venous thrombosis associated with cancer and chemotherapy. TF activity in isolated MPs may be a useful biomarker that can be used either alone or as an adjunctive biomarker in clinical predictive models of thrombotic risk in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Public Health Relevance: Development of blood clots in veins or venous thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability among cancer patients. Both the underlying cancer and the chemotherapy used to treat it are known to increase the risk of venous thrombosis. It is the goal of this research proposal to study the mechanism by which cancer and treatment of cancer with anti-cancer drugs lead to development of blood clots. We will also determine if increase in an important clotting protein in the blood (called tissue factor) is associated with development of blood clots in cancer patients, and if so, whether it could be used to predict which cancer patients are at increased risk for blood clots. This is of enormous importance as physicians will be able to institute measures to prevent thrombosis in high-risk patients and improve clinical outcomes.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major problem in patients with cancer, contributing to mortality and morbidity, interfering with optimum treatment and resulting in high costs. Primary prophylaxis is the most effective management strategy for VTE and is generally recommended for high-risk hospitalized patients. However, cancer treatment and the burden of VTE is shifted increasingly to the ambulatory care setting, but little information is available regarding prophylaxis in cancer outpatients. Successful prophylaxis depends on its application in patients at highest risk, and we have recently developed, validated and published a predictive risk assessment model for VTE in a population of cancer outpatients receiving chemotherapy. In the proposed study, we will build on this model to examine the safety and efficacy of VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients and also characterize the contribution of tissue factor to VTE. The proposal is focused on two specific aims. Aim 1 will be to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the safety efficacy of prophylaxis with dalteparin to no treatment in reducing VTE in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients initiating chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either dalteparin 5000U subcutaneously daily or no prophylaxis for 12 weeks. They will be followed for the development of symptomatic VTE and will undergo screening with serial ultrasonography for asymptomatic DVT and chest CT scan for asymptomatic PE. All thrombotic and bleeding events will be evaluated by blinded adjudicators. Aim 2 will be to establish the value of tissue factor (TF) as a predictive marker for VTE in cancer outpatients receiving chemotherapy. Blood and samples from patients enrolled in the clinical trial described in Aim 1 and from a cohort of concurrent low-risk patients also initiating chemotherapy will be used. We will determine if baseline TF is higher in patients at high-risk compared to those at low or intermediate risk of VTE. Further, we will determine if baseline plasma tissue factor levels are predictive of VTE in the clinical trial. We will determine if increasing TF levels during chemotherapy are predictive of the development of VTE. Finally, we will determine if elevated TF levels correlate with other markers of hemostatic activation. Public Health Relevance: Patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy often develop blood clots in the leg veins that cause pain and swelling and can travel to the lungs causing breathing problems or death. We will conduct a clinical trial to determine if preventive treatment with a low dose of a blood thinning drug will reduce the frequency of these clots. We will also do studies to determine if certain abnormalities in the blood clotting system can help predict this problem.',\n",
       " 'Leishmania of the (Viannia) subgenus are prevalent throughout Latin America. This subgenus causes self-limited cutaneous, chronic mucocutaneous and cutaneous disease, and asymptomatic infection. Although immune mediated hypersensitivity and the inflammatory response are hallmarks of human dermal disease caused by this L. Viannia, and may be therapeutically intervenable, the mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, parasite persistence and reactivation of disease are inadequately understood. Evidence of mixed Th1/Th2 responses throughout the spectrum of infection and disease (mucocutaneous, chronic andasymptomatic) indicates that disease pathogenesis involves distinct mechanisms from Old Worlddermatotrophic species. Understanding of the human immune response in pathogenesis, and persistence of infection has been constrained by:1) limited access to well defined, discrete clinical phenotypes; 2) low resolution of methods applicable in human infection; 3) lack of genetically defined, genetically and immunologically manipulatable experimental models. We will use high resolution technologies (RealTime PCR, microarray, cytometry, targeted gene deletion) clinically disparate, endemically exposed populations and experimentally infected BALB/c and knock out mice to understand the host response in chronic and recurrent disease, and parasite persistence.The ultimate goal of the research is to identify intervenable innate, inflammatory and adaptive processes of disease pathogenesis. Specific Aims are:1 )To determine if Th1/Th2 polarization occurs and is linked to the outcome of infection by L. Viannia; 2) Define the frequency of low and high expression Mif alleles in individuals with chronic or recurrent leishmaniasis and asymptomatic infection, and determine if these alleles are associaed with outcome of infection; 3) Determine the mechanisms that propiciate in vitro susceptibility of human macrophages to L. Viannia infection, and their relationship to clinical phenotype; 4.) Use murine models of L. Viannia to dissect the host response.',\n",
       " 'Morbidity and mortality from atherosclerosis are associated with complicated atherosclerotic lesions due toplaque rupture and severe hemispheric neurological symptoms. However, a group of atherosclerotic patientsremain asymptomatic because of plaque stability. It is not known if and how the stable and unstable plaquesare different biochemically, and how the immune system regulates plaque stability. The studies over the pastseveral years in our laboratory suggest that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent chemoattractantfor monocytes, and possess strong mitogenic and anti-apoptotic activity for vascular smooth muscle cells(VSMCs). Furthermore, we have shown that in stable plaques there is increased density of VSMCs anddecreased number of macrophages and T-lymphocytes, whereas reverse is true with unstable plaques. Wepropose the hypothesis that decreased expression and activity of IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) on VSMCs dueto cytokines released by protiferating and activated T-lymphocytes (IFN-gamma) and macrophages (IL-12and IL-18) leads to apoptosis resulting in the instability of atherosclerotic plaques observed in symptomaticpatients. To these ends the Specific Aims of this application in the carotid plaque VSMCs of bothsymptomatic and asymptomatic patients are: Specific Aim 1: We will examine IGF-l-induced survival ofplaque VSMCs of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the presence and absence of humanatheroma-associated cytokines (11-12, IL-18 and IFN-gamma) using TUNEL, annexin V labeling, time-lapsevideomicroscopy, and caspase 3 activity. For comparison, VSMCs from normal carotid artery will be run inparallel. Specific Aim 2: We will examine the underlying mechanisms of cytokine-induced decrease inIGF-l-induced survival of VSMCs. We will assess the effect of cytokines on IGF-1R and IGFBPs in VSMCsof symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. Specific Aim 3: We will investigate the role of FoxO familyof forkhead transcription factors, specifically FKHR (FoxO1) and FKHR-L1 (FoxO3), and cyclin-dependentkinase inhibitor p27kip1 and Bim, a pro-apoptotic proteinof Bcl-2 family in IGF-l-induced survival of VSMCsfrom symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid plaques. A better understanding of the pathophysiology ofcarotid stenosis and regulatory role of IGF-1 receptors in the stability of plaques will provide opportunities todevelop a more precise and cost-effective treatment.',\n",
       " \"Traffic related air pollution includes diesel engine exhaust derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAH) that have been linked with asthma. Inhaled (32-adrenergic agonists engage membrane bound p2-adrenergic receptors (p2AR) on airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells to cause airway dilation.Preliminary data produced for this application indicate that a diesel exhaust derived mixture of PAHs(DDPAH) impede p2AR mediated airway dilation in normal mice and mice with ovalbumin-induced allergicasthma. In vitro studies indicate that DDPAH attenuates p2AR function in airway epithelial and smoothmuscle cells. These new findings caused us to hypothesize that traffic-related PAH may impede p2ARmediated airway relaxation in asthmatics. This hypothesis suggests a new paradigm where air pollutants notonly worsen childhood asthma but diminish responsiveness to standard therapy. To test this hypothesis weare proposing 3 aims regarding the effect of traffic-related PAH (TR-PAH) on airway p2AR function. Aim 1: Determine if traffic-related PAHs affect p2AR expression and function in airway epithelialcells in vitro. Primary mouse tracheal epithelial (MTE) and human airway epithelial cells will be treated withenvironmentally relevant concentrations of a DDPAH or a mixture of PAH that matches exposures of childrenin the CCCEH cohort described in project 1 (CCCEH-PAH) prior to assessment of the p2AR and its signaltransduction pathway. Aim 2: Ascertain if traffic-related PAHs affect p2AR function in airway smooth muscle cells invitro. Human airway smooth muscles cells will be exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations ofDDPAH or CCCEH-PAH prior to assessment of the p2AR and its signal transduction pathway. Aim 3: Determine if TR-PAHs alter airway p2AR function following in utero and early lifeexposures? The experiments in this aim will test if prolonged exposure to DDPAH or CCCEH-PAH altersp2AR-mediated reductions in airways reactivity in young mice. These experiments will utilize mouse modelsof in utero and early-life exposure that model the windows of asthma susceptibility being investigated inprojects 1, 2, and 3. These experiments will be conducted in normal mice, mice with allergic asthma(ovalbumin immunization and rechallenge), mice with targeted deletions of the p2AR, and mice withinterruption of epithelial cell p2AR function. The focused studies within these aims incorporate environmentally relevant PAH exposures, moleculartools, clinically relevant cell lines, genetically engineered mice, and gene transfer to generate models that willallow us address a novel hypothesis regarding the interaction of airborne pollutants and asthma. Theseexperiments complement the studies outlined throughout this DISCOVER project to provide new insights intohow common air pollutants affect children's lung health.\",\n",
       " \"Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) accounts for nearly half of all curable sexually transmitted infections worldwide, including 5 million new infections annually in the US. Though infection is often asymptomatic in men and women, urethritis, vaginitis and cervicitis are not uncommon. In women, Tv has been associated with adverse birth outcomes, and infection is an important co-factor in HIV transmission. The extent of Tv strain variation and whether some strains are more likely to produce symptomatic or asymptomatic infection are not known. Reports of resistance to metronidazole have appeared and are increasing, but there have been few studies documenting the true extent of treatment failures, since distinction between reinfection and persistent infection await a practical typing system. Development of a reliable, molecular Tv typing system would improve understanding the epidemiology of Tv infection, resulting in better detection and treatment of trichomoniasis, which in turn are needed improve women'sreproductive health and reduce HIV transmission where Tv is common. The specific aims are 1) To establish Tv genotypes based on sequence and length polymorphisms at sites in the parasite genome containing tandem DNA repeats. Loci containing variable numbers of tandem repeats will be amplified by PCR. Allele length polymorphisms will be exploited to generate a multi-locus typing system. 2) To define the genetic heterogeneity of Tv viruses (TVV) in recent clinical isolates to identify subgroups of TVV+ strains. Viral polymerase cDNA sequences will be generated and compared to reveal the relatedness and clustering patterns of TVVs. 3) To examine strain types of existing clinical specimens including Tv from sexual partners. Using the typing system developed in Aims 1 and 2, we will compare T. vaginalis strain types from infected women and their male partners attending two STD clinics in NC and one in AL to define the extent of strain differences within and between sexual partnerships and within and between clinic populations. We will also test the hypotheses that differences in Tv straintypes contribute to clinical presentation and transmission by comparing the distribution of Tv types among women with or without symptoms and whose partners were or were not infected with Tv. The results of these studies may lead to the development of methods to identify particularly important Tv strains, improving treatment, and thereby reducing the adverse health consequences of this enormously prevalent STI.\",\n",

       " 'The goal of this Project is to identify a subset of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of probands with rheumatoidarthritis (RA) who are currently asymptomatic but who demonstrate both genotypic and phenotypiccharacteristics that are highly predictive of the development of RA within 3-5 years. We believe thatidentifying and further characterizing this very high risk population is key to the future goal of developing aprimary prevention strategy that would target those individuals for therapeutic intervention prior to the onsetof clinically active RA. As part of a funded R01, over the next five years we will finish enrolling and fullyevaluating 2100 FDRs of probands with RA. Based on preliminary data, we expect to find a substantialnumber of FDRs who exhibit patterns of RA-related autoantibodies associated with progression to RA butwho do not yet have clinically active disease. From the probands as well as these FDRs, we will also obtainbiologic samples that can be used for DNA and other biomarker analysis. We are funded in that R01 toperform RA-related autoantibody and HLA-DR shared epitope analysis, and to re-evaluate FDRs serially inorder to follow clinical phenotypes and obtain serial biologic samples. Because of the study design, FDRscan also be readily stratified for the new studies we propose herein by clinical phenotype, RA shared epitopeor other genotype, and autoantibody status. Based on additional preliminary data, we expect to find, usingboth cross sectional and serial analyses, that the RA-associated autoantibody positive FDR group can befurther divided into a population that does not exhibit additional biomarkers that are very likely to beassociated with progression to clinically active RA, and a population that does exhibit such features ofprogression. We also expect to find evidence of B and T cell dysfunction in unaffected FDRs who exhibit RArelatedautoantibodies and will have a unique opportunity to detect pathogenic T cell epitopes. Toaccomplish these goals, we propose the following Specific Aims:Specific Aim #1: Determine the proportion of asymptomatic autoantibody-positive FDRs who also exhibitadditional biomarkers typically found in patients with active RA.Specific Aim #2: Determine in asymptomatic FDRs the relationships of RA-related autoantibodies andbiomarkers to the presence of specific genetic alleles and HLA haplotypes that are associated with theclassification of active RA.Specific Aim #3: Examine FDRs who exhibit RA-related autoantibodies for the presence of dysregulated Band T cell immune responses to RA-related autoantigens.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the field of biomedical science there is an urgent need for medicinal compounds that are safe and efficient nuclear targeting vectors and which retain their properties of high selectivity and efficacy in treating cellular diseases. In this vein, the goal of the proposed research is the rational design of a nanoparticle-bioconjugate that addresses the multiple functional necessities needed as a possible treatment of malignancy in biological systems at the cellular level. Due to a peptide-bioconjugate surface functional group composed of bovine serum albumin and several viral peptide sequences, the proposed nanoparticle system possesses the ability to traverse cellular membranes. Once within the cellular membrane a dirhodium photodynamic molecule that is also surface-attached to the nanoparticle surface can be activated to cleave the cellular DNA with blue light. This DNA cleavage process can be controlled and has applications in the treatment of cellular diseases such as cancer. The proposed photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent may serve as a model in terms of its novel approach to drug cellular delivery and cancer treatment.',\n",

This research is an ongoing, multidisciplinary prospective longitudinal study of CMV infection in mothers and their infants.  Two hundred three subjects with virologically confirmed congenital CMV infection, 103 asymptomatic, 62 symptomatic, and 38 uninfected controls now have been enrolled, and are being followed.  Mean age at last follow-up is now 5.4 years for symptomatic, 8 years for asymptomatic, and 13 years for control subjects.  CT scans have been performed on 60/62 of the symptomatic infants (67% were abnormal), and 90/103 asymptomatics (26% were abnormal).  Audiologic assessments have been performed in 60/62 symptomatics (67% have hearing loss), 98/103 asymptomatics (15% have hearing loss).  The aims for the next 5 years are to continue careful follow-up to characterize the incidence of hearing loss as to age at onset, unilateral vs. bilateral, severity, fluctuation, and progression, to determine correlation of very high frequency losses and abnormal cochlear emissions studies with hearing loss, and to relate abnormal CT scans to audiologic and developmental outcome.  The differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic congenitally infected subjects and uninfected controls will be compared to determine neonatal predictors of outcome at school age and longitudinal follow-up will continue through high school to document late sequelae that may occur during adolescence.',\n",

While the incidence of ARF has declined in industrialized countries, it remains high in Hawaii particularly among Samoans.  The objectives of the proposed research are to identify GAS types responsible for clinical disease, particularly ARF in Samoans, and to determine the serologic responses to these specific infections.  Our central hypothesis is that the GAS emm types associated with sequelae in Samoans in Hawaii originate from circular migration of Samoans, thus resulting in the high incidence of ARF in Hawaii.  The secondary hypothesis is that the antibody responses to GAS infections are different in Samoans.  We base these hypotheses on our preliminary studies which indicate that GAS emm types, which are uncommonly found on the continental US and not classically associated with ARF, are frequently identified among Hawaiian patients with GAS infections and ARF; and that asymptomatic children and ARF patients of Samoan ethnicity have higher prevalence rates of GAS infections due to these uncommon emm types.  The proposed study will address these specific aims:Specific aim 1. Determine the GAS types circulating among Samoan children in Hawaii and American Samoa: a. Prospectively collect GAS isolates from throats of asymptomatic school-aged children, patients with mild throat and skin infections, patients with invasive infections and with ARF in American Samoa and Hawaii, b. Perform emm gene sequencing, T agglutination typing, opacity factor typing of these GAS isolates, c. Analyze the differences among GAS emm types isolated in American Samoa and Hawaii.  Specific aim 2. Determine the GAS types and anti-streptococcal antibody responses in cohorts of Samoans: a. Establish two cohorts of 50 Samoan children each from Hawaii and American Samoa to include patients with ARF, pharyngitis, skin infection, invasive GAS infection and asymptomatic school-aged children with GAS colonization and repeat throat swabs of these cohorts 3 times within an 18-month study period, b. Prospectively determine the anti-streptococcal antibody responses [antistreptolysin O and anti-DNase B titers] in the two cohorts.The study results will provide new knowledge about GAS epidemiology associated with human migration and will yield comprehensive data to address the means by which different populations are affected differently by a wide variety of GAS types.

       " 'Malaria is among the leading infectious causes of death in many of the worlds poorest countries. This parasitic mosquito-borne illness produces massive hemolysis in many infected human hosts.  While much is known about parasite replication and cytoadherence, very little is known about the impact of hemolysis per se on vascular tone and endothelial function.  Crossing a number of medical disciplines beyond the scope of malaria, intriguing new research on inherited hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease provides clues to pathogenic mechanisms that may be relevant to malaria.  We have characterized a mechanism of disease, hemolysis-associated endothelial dysfunction, in which red blood cell hemoglobin spills into plasma and reacts with and oxidatively destroys nitric oxide.  Additionally, erythrocyte arginase I is released into plasma and catabolizes arginine, the substrate for endothelial nitric oxide synthesis.  As a result, the profound reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability produces vasomotor instability, oxidant stress, inflammation, endothelial adhesion molecule expression, activation of tissue factor, and platelet aggregation.  Consistent with shared mechanisms, these same pathways are found to be activated during malarial infection.  Chronic hemolysis in hemoglobinopathies also leads to a disease syndrome, hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension, which develops in all chronic hereditary and acquired hemolytic conditions and is associated with excessive morbidity and mortality.  Despite the recent appreciation of these mechanisms, not one study can be found in the literature evaluating pulmonary hypertension in human malaria.This protocol therefore aims to evaluate mechanisms governing interrelationships among malaria, intravascular hemolysis, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelial function, pulmonary hypertension, and evolutionarily-selected host polymorphisms that regulate the host response to hemolysis.  We will correlate our clinical observations in the field with laboratory assays of hemolysis and nitric oxide bioavailability related to scavenging by cell-free hemoglobin and arginine catabolism.  Using a candidate gene approach, we will identify and selectively characterize polymorphisms in genes important for endothelial function, vascular inflammation and disease phenotype.  Finally, the characterization of this mechanism in malaria may catalyze the development of novel therapies targeting this pathway, such as sodium nitrite, inhaled nitric oxide gas, and/or recombinant haptoglobin infusions.This study will take place in a malaria-endemic region of Mali in West Africa.  Both cases and controls will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Hospital Gabriel Tour in Bamako, which is the major pediatric referral hospital in Mali. Controls will be recruited from among healthy children attending the Immunization Clinic at the Hpital Gabriel Tour, and from among siblings of cases.  All patients presenting with malaria symptoms are routinely tested via a simple finger prick and blood smear.  Per our proposal, patients age 1-5 years with blood smears positive for P. falciparum infection will be considered for case study enrollment.  Siblings may be enrolled as healthy or asymptomatic controls or uncomplicated cases.  Using blood from the same fingerstick, a portable hemoglobin meter will determine if parasitemic patients meet criteria for severe malarial anemia (SMA).    If consent is granted, a clinician investigator will perform a detailed history and physical examination to categorize malaria severity accordingto modified World Health Organization definitions.  We will enroll up to 650 volunteers total, to compile complete studies on 125 persons per group.  Due to expected limitations with echocardiograms, 125 studies should yield 100 readable  tricuspid regurgitate jet velocity data points per subject group.    SUBJECT GROUPS:A.\\tHealthy uninfected controlsB.\\tAsymptomatic parasitemia controlsC.\\tUncomplicated malaria casesD.\\tSevere malarial anemia casesThese diagnostic assessments and clinical classifications represent current standard practice.  We will initially screen volunteers for the Healthy control and SMA groups; we expect these groups to be most different in our targeted clinical and laboratory measurements.   The NHLBI IRB approved the protocol on 8/7/07.  The study was approved in Mali on 10/6/08 and at Tulane University on 10/8/08.  The first subject was enrolled on 10/20/08.

Each participant also underwent echocardiography (165 completed echocardiograms including follow-ups).   Obtaining a blood sample for standard hematology and chemistry panels, research bloods, as well as DNA collection for isolation and plasma storage followed the echocardiogram.Based on these studies the prevalence of PAH in the severe malarial anemia subjects was 64% versus 19% I the health controls.  We also have echocardiographs on the asymptomatic parasitemia and uncomplicated malaria arms, but this data has not yet been analyzed.',\n",
       " 'This protocol is designed to study the natural history and epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in an asymptomatic blood donor population. Thus far, 749 subjects have been enrolled, including 478 recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) positives, 54 RIBA indeterminates, and 217 RIBA-negative controls. The early data have been published (New England Journal of Medicine 334:1691,1996) and the trends have remained the same over time. Unexpected findings were the high proportion (41 percent) of RIBA+ donors who admitted to prior (remote) intravenous drug use and the strong independent association between cocaine snorting and HCV positivity. Shared paraphernalia for snorting accompanied by epistaxis, may serve as a covert vehicle for parenteral viral transmission. Among anti-HCV+/RIBA-positive donors, 82 percent were persistently viremic, but 18 percent appeared to have recovered from prior HCV infection. A liver biopsy has been obtained from 186 (47%)patients who were chronically infected; 51% had mild chronic hepatitis and 44% had moderate chronic hepatitis; despite a mean duration of infection of 20 years,only 5% had severe inflammation. No fibrosis was observed in 33% of biopsied patients and 52% had only mild fibrosis; 15 had more severe fibrosis including 13% with bridging fibrosis and 2% with cirrhosis. Overall, HCV infection in this cohort was generally asymptomatic and clinically benign. Despite an association of HCV with sexually promiscuous practices, we found no evidence for sexual transmission to the specific partners of 165 HCV-infected individuals.

       " \"We examined the association of the onset of dementia with the time course of cognitive performance in tests of episodic memory, executive function, and verbal intelligence from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Using change point analyses to identify the initiation of significant declines in performance before the onset of dementia, we found that declines in performance on tests of episodic memory accelerated 7 years before diagnosis; executive function accelerated 2-3 years before diagnosis; and verbal intelligence declined in close proximity to diagnosis. Identifying the onset of pre-clinical disease may become important as we develop biomarkers for disease onset and as we develop therapies because it is likely to indicate when therapies might be most effective.  However, the present study can tell us only the aggregate onset timing. It cannot tell us when the onset is likely for particular individuals. Clearly, further work is required before these studies reach their potential.Alzheimers disease pathology is present in many individuals with no symptoms of dementia or cognitive deficits before death. The implications of this pathology are unknown. It either signifies the early presence of disease that fails to manifest behaviorally in cognitive performance. Or, it represents normal aging and is not disease, per se. If the former, these individuals would have eventually manifested symptoms of dementia had they lived longer. If the latter, our interpretation of Alzheimers pathology may be incomplete. Using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging Autopsy Study, we examined participants who underwent prospective neuropsychological and neurological evaluations before autopsy. These participants and their families agreed to autopsy following death. They were followed with annual home examinations when they were unable to return to the National Institute on Aging. Our main objective was to determine whether cognitive trajectories differed between clinically normal participants with and without Alzheimers disease neuropathology. In addition, we investigated whether clinically impaired individuals showed accelerated rates of cognitive decline compared with clinically normal elderly adults. We found that clinically normal elderly individuals with and without AD neuropathology had similar cognitive trajectories across several cognitive domains. In contrast, individuals with mild cognitive impairment or clinical Alzheimers disease had steeper rates of longitudinal decline in several domains of cognition compared with clinically normal elderly individuals regardless of whether the latter had Alzheimers neuropathology. Moreover, the cognitive differences between impaired and unimpaired groups could be detected years before a diagnosis of dementia. These results suggest that clinically normal individuals with and without Alzheimers neuropathology do not differ in rates of cognitive decline across a number of cognitive domains.The main finding of this prospective study of autopsied BLSA participants is that clinically normal elderly individuals with Alzheimers neuropathology do not differ from those free of Alzheimers neuropathology in rates of change in cognitive performance over time. With the exception of Cued Selective Reminding, neuropsychological tests tapping a number of cognitive domains showed comparable performance trajectories for Normal and Asymptomatic-AD groups. Although the two groups differed significantly on Cued Selective Reminding, a memory test, the Asymptomatic-AD group remained stable, whereas the Normal group showed a decline in performance over time. Our findings extend the observations reported by several groups that substantial Alzheimers neuropathology may be present before cognitive deficits become evident.We also examined the effect of clinically overt stroke on the risk of dementia using clinical data from participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging Autopsy Study. Among participants aged 70 and older who were evaluated yearly for a mean of 10 years, we found that clinical stroke was a risk factor for dementia. However, the majority of participants who became demented after stroke had mild cognitive impairment that did not meet criteria for dementia preceding the initial stroke. In contrast, participants with normal cognition at the time of stroke did not have an increased risk of dementia. Thus, it appears that stroke is a risk factor for the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to frank dementia. These data suggest that preexisting cognitive status is the crucial determinant of post-stroke dementia.The literature on the association of stroke and dementia agrees that cerebral infarcts are a significant risk for clinical dementia. The literature also agrees that Alzheimers pathology and vascular pathology contribute additively, but not interactively, to the clinical manifestation. However, the literature is equivocal about importance of vascular risk factors, asymptomatic infarcts, infarct size, and infarct location as causes of dementia. In a follow-on study, we examined the risk for dementia associated with brain infarcts in participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging Autopsy Study. Brain infarcts were common in this cohort. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infarcts were associated with increased risk for dementia, but risk factors for stroke (e.g., hypertension) did not increase the risk for dementia in the absence of an infarct. Risk for dementia was associated with the number of infarcts, but not the size or location of hemispheral infarcts. Microscopic infarcts had similar risk for dementia as macroscopic infarcts. Analyses of the effect of infarcts and Alzheimers pathology on dementia indicated that Alzheimers pathology alone accounted for 50% of the dementia in this cohort, and 35% was accounted for by hemispheral infarcts alone or in conjunction with Alzheimers disease.It is common to find substantial numbers of A-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in autopsy brains of older individuals with documented normal cognition, a condition we define as asymptomatic Alzheimers pathology. We examined the morphometric changes of neurons in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, a condition characterized by the presence of Alzheimers lesions in subjects without cognitive impairment. In autopsy brains, we used stereological methods to compare the cell body and nuclear volumes of neurons from the anterior cingulate gyrus and CA1 hippocampal regions in individuals with asymptomatic Alzheimers disease (n=9), Alzheimers dementia (n=8), mild cognitive impairment (n=9), and age-matched controls (n=9). In anterior cingulate gyrus, we observed a significant decrease in the neuronal volume of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease compared to controls, but no such atrophy in asymptomatic Alzheimers. Moreover, we found a significant increase (p<0.01) in nuclear volume in asymptomatic Alzheimers compared to controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers disease brains. Similar results were found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This nuclear hypertrophy may represent an early neuronal reaction to A-beta or Tau, or a compensatory mechanism that forestalls the progression of Alzheimers disease and allows the brain to resist the development of dementia.  In a follow-up to this study, we recently extended this finding to additional regions and to nucleolar as well as nuclear hypertrophy in cingulate and hippocampal regions.\",\n",
       " 'Previously, a total of 18 adult volunteers was given orally 1 ml of a 0.2% stool filtrate containing the virulent human rotavirus strain D (G1, P1A8, NSP4B) (Kapikian, et al., 1983. J. Infec. Dis. 147:95). Four of 5 who shed rotavirus after challenge developed diarrhea. In an attempt to identify correlates of resistance to rotaviral diarrheal disease and/or infection, we analyzed serum IgA and IgG antibody titers in 16 of the 18 volunteers. We used an immunocytochemistry assay involving a total of 18 different recombinant baculoviruses expressing each of the following major serotype/genotype sepcificities of rotavirus proteins for the serologic assays: VP4 (P8; P4; P6; P9; P10); VP7 (G1-4, G9); NSP4 (A-D); as well as VP6 and NSP2. The prechallenge IgG antibody titers to types G1 and G3 VP7, types P8 and P6 VP4 and type A NSP4 in the non-infected group were significantly higher than those in the asymptomatically infected and symptomatically infected groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the higher probability of resistance to asymptomatic and symptomatic rotavirus infection correlated with higher prechallenge IgG antibody titers to the homotypic VP7 (G1) (p is equal to 0.0077 for asymptomatic infection; p is equal to 0.0004 for symptomatic infection) and the homotypic VP4 (P8) (p is equal to 0.0091 for asymptomatic infection; p is equal to 0.0011 for symptomatic infection), suggesting that protection against rotavirus infection and disease may be VP7- and/or VP4-homotypic although they may not be the sole determinants of protective immunity.Using an immunocytochemical staining assay involving six different recombinant baculoviruses with each expressing one of the major bovine rotavirus VP7 (G6, G8 or G10) and VP4 (P1, P5 or P11) serotypes, we analyzed IgG antibody responses to individual proteins in archival serum samples collected from 31 Holstein calves approximately monthly from 1 month to 12 months of age during 1974-1975 at the Arizona Dairy Company located in Higley, Arizona.  The calves were given colostrum immediately after birth and raised separately from their mothers.  The serum samples sent to NIH were stored in a -20 degree Celsius freezer until testing.  A total of 309 serum samples were analyzed in this study.  Each of 31 calves experienced at least one rotavirus infection as determined by a 4-fold or greater G- and/or P-serotype-specific antibody response during the period of 12 months.  Of note was the finding that calves that experienced their first seroresponse between 2 and <4 months of age had a significantly lower antibody titer to certain serotypes at 1 month of age than those that developed a seroresponse later, suggesting that maternal antibody might play a role in delaying primary infections and/or the development of antibody responses.  Seroresponses to VP7 and VP4, as determined by a 4-fold or greater antibody response, were not always elicited concurrently following infection: in some calves seroresponses to VP7 were detected earlier than to VP4 or vice versa.  In addition, in some calves, a subsequent 2nd seroresponse was detected for VP7 or VP4 only. This temporal dissociation of VP7-VP4 responses may be a function of preexisting maternally-derived or primary infection-induced G and/or P type-specific antibodies in calves present at the time of the 2nd rotavirus infection. Analyses of serum samples showed that the G8 serotype infected calves most frequently (35.5%) followed by G6 (19.4%), G10 (12.9%), and mixed G type infections (32.3%). With regard to VP4, an IgG response to P1 was detected in 25.8% of samples followed by P5 (12.9%), P11 (6.5%), and mixed P type infections (54.8%).  The most frequent G-P combination was G8:P1 followed by G8:P5, G8:P11 and G6:P1.  Our analyses of VP7- and VP4-specific antibody responses in calves indicated that (i) repeated infections were less likely to be caused by the G and/or P types than those caused by primary infections (Chi square is equal to 3.96, p is equal to 0.047); and (ii) protection against rotavirus reinfection tended to be serotype specific.  Although there is still considerable disagreement on the role and importance of serotype-specific immunity in protection against rotavirus-caused illness, our data support the strategy of the administration of a multivalent vaccine and multiple vaccinations in order to elicit broader protection against prevailing serotypes in humans.',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have advanced the objectives of this project as follows:(1) It is well known that multiple serial passages of a wild-type virulent virus in cell culture often results in the loss of virulence of the virus in a homologous host, which has been a traditional strategy in generating attenuated live viral vaccines including Rotarix vaccine.  However, mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood.  The purpose of this study was to monitor phenotypic and molecular characteristics of (i) a mouse-adapted virulent murine rotavirus following serial passages in cell cultures and (ii) a cell culture-adapted avirulent murine rotavirus following serial passages in mouse pups.    We passaged a cell culture-adapted avirulent (non-diarrheagenic) murine rotavirus EB strain serially in 4-5 day-old CD-1 mice until the virus became virulent (diarrheagenic).  This virulent virus was then inoculated onto primary African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells and passaged serially 18 times.  The 18th cell culture-passaged virus that was shown to be avirulent in mouse pups became virulent again during subsequent serial passage in CD-1 mice.  This virulent virus when passaged again serially 18 times in primary AGMK cells became avirulent in mice.  Sequencing of all 11 genes of selected virulent and avirulent viruses generated in this study, revealed that virulent viruses when compared with avirulent viruses bore (i) distinct mutations (residues 385, 537, 538 and 558) in gene 4 (encoding outer capsid VP4) and in gene 10 (residues  21 and 37) (encoding viral enterotoxin NSP4) and (ii) no significant mutations in other genes.  In addition, no significant difference in virus replication efficiency in mice was observed between virulent and avirulent viruses.  We generated 3 baculovirus recombinants expressing the NSP4 protein derived from high mouse-passaged virulent EB virus (sample A), low mouse-passaged virulent EB virus (sample B), or cell culture-passaged avirulent EB virus (sample C).  Following oral inoculation of various recombinant NSP4 proteins in mouse pups, diarrhea developed in 91.6% (11/12) in sample A group; 12.5% (1 of 8) in sample B group; and 0% (0 of 12) in sample C group, indicating that the NSP4 protein played an important role in pathogenesis in this model.    (2) Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in a wide variety of mammalian and avian species and, in general, highly species-specific. In addition, the genome RNA homology among rotavirus strains in a given animal species has been reported to be much higher than that of rotavirus strains derived from different animal species as demonstrated by RNA-RNA hybridization. However, there are a number of reports of atypical rotavirus strains isolated from humans and other animal species that share genetic and antigenic features of virus strains derived from heterologous species.  Epizootiologic studies have demonstrated that rotaviruses bearing G3:P3 specificity are common in both dogs and cats.  Interestingly, there have been at least 6 reports describing the detection of G3:P3 strains in humans: Ro1845, HCR3A and HCR3B, CMH222, PA260/97 and CRI33594. Among them, the Ro1845 and HCR3A strains, which were isolated in the mid-1980s, were analyzed fairly extensively with various assays (e.g., RNA-RNA hybridization, restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and sequencing of VP4 and VP7 genes). RNA-RNA hybridization assays, which demonstrated that each of these two human G3:P3 strains formed 10 or 11 hybrid bands versus certain canine and feline rotavirus strains bearing a G3:P3 specificity, suggested a possible transmission of whole rotavirus virions of canine/feline origin to humans.  We sequenced and analyzed all 11 genes of strains Ro1845 and HCR3A as well as 3 canine strains (CU-1, K9 and A79-10, each with G3:P3 specificity) and 2 feline strains (Cat97 with G3:P3 specificity and Cat2 with G3:P9 specificity), and demonstrated that (i) these 2 human G3P3 strains were indeed examples of whole virion transmissions of canine/feline rotaviruses to humans; and (ii) each of 11 cognate genes of the 6 G3:P3 strains shared a characteristically high nucleotide identity and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster suggesting that canine and feline rotaviruses with G3:P3 specificity bore highly conserved species-specific genomes that were distinct from genomes of human, simian, bovine, porcine or avian rotavirus origin. Although each of 11 cognate genes of the 6 G3:P3 strains analyzed in the present study displayed high sequence identity (94-99% nt and 94-100% aa), the clinical symptoms of the hosts from which these strains were isolated varied depending upon the strain. The HRV Ro1845, CRV K9 and FRV Cat97 strains were derived from diarrheal hosts whereas the HRV HCR3A and CRV CU-1 strains were isolated from asymptomatic hosts. By using a genetic approach, we and others showed previously that at least 6 genome segments (i.e., genes encoding VP3, VP4, VP7, NSP1, NSP3 and NSP4) were involved in pathogenesis of rotaviruses. Therefore, it was of interest to analyze the involvement of these 6 virulence-associated genes in the observed differences in clinical signs of the hosts by comparing whole genome nucleotide sequences between 3 symptomatic (Ro1845, K9 and Cat97) and 2 asymptomatic (HCR3A and CU-1) strains. Analyses revealed the existence between the two groups of (i) 11 mutations in the VP7 gene, (ii) 6 mutations in the VP3 gene, (iii) 4 mutations in the NSP4 gene, (iv) 2 mutations each in the VP1, VP4 and NSP3 genes, (v) 1 mutation each in the VP2, NSP1 and NSP5 genes, and (vi) no mutations in the VP6 and NSP2 genes.  Although the numbers of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were too few to draw a significant association, comparative whole genome sequence analyses were in agreement with previous genetic studies, since there were several mutations in the virulence-associated genes and a few mutations or no mutations at all in the genes not associated with virulence. The Ro1845 and HCR3A strains (which were shown to be of canine/feline origin in this study) were recovered from a heterologous host (i.e., humans) whereas the CU-1, K9, A79-10 and Cat97 strains were recovered from a homologous host (i.e., dogs or cats). In order to analyze whether the canine/feline rotaviruses acquired any mutation(s) during the replication in a heterologous host, we compared whole genome nucleotide sequences of the 4 strains (i.e., CU-1, K9, A79-10 and Cat97) recovered from a homologous host to those of the 2 strains (i.e., Ro1845 and HCR3A) isolated from a heterologous host.  The following mutations were detected in the 2 groups:  (i) 2 each in the VP2, VP3 and NSP4 gene, (ii) 1 in the NSP1 and NSP3 gene, and (iii) none in the VP1, VP4, VP6, VP7, NSP2 and NSP5 genes.  Since no mutations were detected in the VP1, VP4, VP6, VP7, NSP2 and NSP5 genes in the 2 groups, these proteins did not appear to restrict human (heterologous) infection by canine/feline G3:P3 viruses.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary restriction (DR), a reduction of nutrients in the diet, provides the most robust method of lifespan extension in species as diverse as yeast, worms, fruit flies and rodents. It has been shown in rodents that DR protects against a number of age-related diseases including Huntington's, cancer, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. Given the universally protective effects of DR, investigating its molecular mechanisms will promote a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of various human age-related diseases, which will in turn help advance the development of therapeutics for these disorders. Due to their short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation, invertebrate models continue to be useful as models for understanding human diseases and in providing therapeutic targets. Given the conservation of biological processes and signaling pathways, studies in model organisms are likely to make the greatest contributions to our understanding of biological mechanisms of lifespan extension by DR. Using an interdisciplinary approach which combines genetics, genomics and biochemistry techniques we propose to examine how DR extends lifespan in flies. The Kapahi lab previously identified the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway as a critical regulator of nutrient modulated lifespan changes in flies. This genetic pathway plays a conserved role in sensing nutrients in yeast, worms, flies and humans. Building upon the knowledge that nutrients play a key role in modulating mRNA translation, the conversion of RNA to protein, this proposal tests the hypothesis that differential mRNA translation downstream of 4EBP plays a key role in determining lifespan. The Kapahi laboratory has identified that a fly mutant defective in modulating mRNA translation upon changes in nutrients in the diet also fails to show the extension in lifespan normally observed under DR. This suggests that modulating mRNA translation is a key mechanism that determines longevity. Using a novel methodology that measures the mRNA translation state at the genome wide level, the lab has identified significant changes in mitochondrial genes that regulate metabolism upon DR. This data suggests that under DR, flies switch to a metabolic state that allows more efficient utilization of energy; this proposal examines the role of this switch in metabolic function and other differentially translated genes in regulating lifespan upon DR.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Dietary restriction is the most robust environmental method of lifespan extension in various species and has been shown to protect against various age-related diseases including diabetes, cancer and neurodegeneration. This proposal investigates the mechanism by which TOR (target of rapamycin) mediates the lifespan extension effects by dietary restriction using Drosophila. Our findings will have a significant effect on understanding the role of nutrition in aging and age-related diseases in humans.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the isolation of a specified quantity of bacteria from a person without symptoms or signs referableto urinary infection. ASB is common in women and increases with advancing age. There is some evidence that treatment of ASB does not prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) and may actually lead to an increased incidence of uropathogen antibiotic resistance with a higher likelihood of complications. Questions remain as to incidence of ASB in the renal transplant recipient and whether certain virulence factors expressed on uropathic bacteria facilitate symptomatic UTI or acute renal allograft injury. In preliminary retrospective studies, we found that the majority of renal transplant patients with E. coli UTI are asymptomatic. Despite the lack of UTI symptoms, some renal transplant patients with ASB develop cystitis, pyelonephritis or acute kidney injury. The majority of the bacterial isolates from ASB patients with renal allograft injury express uropathic P fimbriae, an adhesin molecule that facilitates bacterial attachment to the uro-epithelium and may contribute to an injurious inflammatory immune response. In addition, the urinary isolates from renal transplant patients with E. coli ASB are frequently resistant to common antimicrobial agents used to treat UTI. We propose to determine the prevalence of ASB in renal transplant patients and to identify the host characteristics and bacterial virulence factors expressed on ASB isolates that facilitate the develop of symptomatic UTI. Identifying isolates from patients with ASB that express uropathogenic factors will limit inappropriate antibiotic use and decrease the deleterious effects of UTI on renal allograft function. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to determine if screening and treatment of ASB prevents symptomatic UTI and prevents renal allograft injury. Data from this R21 pilot grant will be the background for the design of a multi-center clinical trial of ASB in the renal transplant patient. Information from this trial would lead to a much needed screening and treatment guidelines for ASB in the renal transplant population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection in the kidney transplant patient and are associated with a poor kidney graft and patient survival. It is unclear if asymptomatic UTI, or asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), is associated with the development of symptomatic UTI or graft dysfunction in the renal transplant patient. Recent guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA) acknowledge that  no recommendations can be made for or against screening or treatment of ASB in renal transplant patients . Studies are needed to determine the prevalence of ASB and the host characteristics, bacterial virulence factors and consequences associated with ABU in the renal transplant patient.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virally-encoded neuraminidase plays a key role in the life-cycle of the influenza virus. A class of anti-influenza drugs that inhibits the action of neuraminidase has garnered increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their selectivity and potency. The inhibitors are transition state analogs of the enzyme substrate, sialic acid, and are highly efficacious in in vitro and in vivo studies, with IC50 values in the nM range. However these drugs are very polar and consequently have poor oral bioavailability. At TSRL, we have a developed an amino acid prodrug strategy that targets intestinal transporters for enhanced uptake. Subsequent activation of the absorbed prodrug can then occur either through targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of the prodrug or chemical breakdown of the prodrug to the activate parent compound. This strategy is based on a molecular mechanistic understanding of the transport and activation pathways in cells and tissues and the interaction of prodrug structures with these pathways. In this proposal, we have developed novel amino acid acyloxy ester prodrugs of two neuraminidase inhibitors and provide strong preliminary data showing that these prodrugs are actively transported by intestinal transporter and have good intestinal permeability in an in situ intestinal permeability model. We hypothesize that through this prodrug approach, we can boost the oral availability of selected neuraminidase inhibitors to an extent that they can be developed as oral drug products. In the current project, we propose to fully characterize a series of these prodrugs with regard to their stability, tissue activation, and bioavailability. Compounds showing acceptable characteristics will be tested for in vivo efficacy against the H1N1 virus by the NIAID contract facility at Utah State University. Our molecular mechanistic approach to prodrug design has enormous potential for the development of orally effective neuraminidase inhibitors. More broadly, this prodrug strategy offers great potential and much promise in reaching the ultimate goal of developing viable oral alternatives for a wider range of therapeutically potent antiviral agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TSRL has developed an approach to improve the oral bioavailability of anti-influenza drugs, thus making them suitable for oral delivery. We propose to synthesize and test a series of these compounds for their potential as oral agents. Ultimately, this approach may increase the number of potent anti-virus compounds that are available for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of influenza.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif) is an essential regulatory protein required for HIV- 1 replication in natural target cells such as CD4+ T-cells and macrophages. Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that Vif is a critical viral counter defense that specifically neutralizes an innate antiviral defense mechanism, mediated by human APOBEC3G (A3G) and related cytidine deaminases. These antiviral proteins induce lethal modification of cytosines to uracils in newly synthesized minus-strand viral DNA, resulting in the production of non-functional viruses in the absence of the retroviral Vif protein. Vif hijacks cellular Cullin5 (Cul5), ElonginB, and ElonginC to form a viral E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets A3G for polyubiquitination and degradation. We have identified N,N,N',N'-Tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-Ethylenediamine (TPEN) as a small molecule inhibitor of Vif. The overall goal of this project is to further characterize the novel small molecule Vif inhibitor and its derivatives that restore the potent innate antiviral defense. In particular we propose 1. To examine the effect of TPEN on Vif functions from multiple HIV-1 subtypes as well as HIV-2. We have observed that TPEN is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 Vif (NL4-3) function which allows the anti-viral cytidine deaminase A3G to suppress even the wild-type HIV-1 infectivity. It is not clear whether TPEN could inhibit Vif molecules from a wide range of HIV-1 subtypes. We will construct expression vectors for all the major subtypes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 Vif molecules and test the effect of TPEN on these Vif molecules. We will also determine whether TPEN could inhibit HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells which express endogenous A3G. Studies proposed in this aim are designed to further substantiate the effect of TPEN anti-HIV activity. 2. To examine the effect of derivatives of TPEN on Vif function and the anti-viral activity of A3G. We have observed that TPEN is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 Vif function which allows the anti-viral mammalian cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) to suppress even the wild-type HIV-1 infectivity. It is not clear whether TPEN inhibits Vif solely through zinc chelation, since another membrane permeable zinc chelator, chloroquinol, was not effective. To address this issue, we will evaluate TPEN derivatives that do not have the ability to bind zinc for anti-Vif activity. TPEN derivatives that have altered hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or charged properties will also be evaluated for their anti-Vif function. Studies proposed in this aim are designed to further characterize the mechanism of TPEN anti-HIV activity and to identify more potent anti-Vif inhibitors with a broad therapeutic window.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a central target for antiviral treatment of AIDS and detailed knowledge of its structure and function has important clinical and biological consequences. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors are used as effective drugs for treating AIDS, but success can be limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. Novel non-nucleoside RT inhibitors have been developed through structure-based methods, including the recently approved drug etravirine/TMC125/Intelence, and we propose to carry out crystallographic studies that could enable structure-guided improvement of additional classes of RT inhibitors. The proposed work will involve structure determination of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 RT in the presence and absence of nucleic acid substrates and inhibitors. Structural studies of inhibitor will explore binding sites for known drugs (NRTIs and NNRTIs) as well as other potential drug targeting sites including the RNase H active site. Use of strategically modified protein and nucleic acids will enhance the efficiency and quality of the structural studies. The structures determined will enhance our understanding of mechanisms of polymerase and RNase H catalysis, inhibition, and of drug resistance.

Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors are used as effective drugs for treating AIDS, but success can be limited by the emergence of drug-resistant viral variants. The proposed studies will enhance opportunities for targeting known and new sites on RT including RNase H, the only HIV enzyme not yet blocked by anti-AIDS drugs.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease is essential for viral replication and has proved a very effective target for antiviral drugs to treat AIDS. But, the long term effectiveness of current AIDS therapy is confronted by the major challenge of rapid development of drug-resistant HIV. Multiple mutations accumulate in the protease in response to inhibitor therapy and produce resistance. The overall goal is to develop new antiviral protease inhibitors and therapeutic strategies to overcome the problem of drug- resistance. The overarching hypothesis is that improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms for HIV resistance to protease inhibitors will aid in development of potent new therapeutic agents to combat drug resistant virus. Our kinetic and structural analysis has shown that protease mutations can produce inhibitor resistance by several mechanisms, including lower affinity for inhibitor due to mutations that alter the inhibitor binding site, and altered protease stability due to mutations that alter the dimer interface. The central design strategy is that inhibitors with improved polar interactions with conserved regions of HIV protease will be potent drugs for resistant HIV. Our analysis of HIV protease-inhibitor structures has demonstrated the importance of the conserved set of hydrogen bond interactions between main chain atoms of peptide analogs and the protease backbone atoms. Our crystallographic analysis shows that the earlier clinical inhibitors have fewer of these polar interactions and high affinity is achieved by van der Waals interactions with protease side chains, leading to sensitivity to mutations in the binding site. The new antiviral inhibitor darunavir (TMC114; UIC-94017) was designed and confirmed to include more hydrogen bonds with protease main chain atoms. Darunavir showed fewer changes than other clinical inhibitors on the structures and activities of mutant proteases, resulting in high potency, excellent resistance profile, and approval for AIDS salvage therapy in June 2006. Our design strategy was further verified by analysis of the antiviral inhibitors GRL-06579A and GRL-98065. The appearance of new resistance mutations, diverse mechanisms of resistance and adverse side effects of drugs necessitate the development of new non-peptide inhibitors to expand the repertoire and potency of antiviral agents for resistant HIV. This research integrates in vitro analysis of the crystal structures and enzymatic activities of HIV protease mutants, chemical synthesis, and antiviral studies in HIV-infected cells to design novel protease inhibitors in the combat against resistant HIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The effectiveness of drugs that target HIV-1 protease for HIV/AIDS therapy is greatly reduced by drug resistance due to mutant proteases. New antiviral agents are being developed to overcome drug resistance with the aid of analysis of the structure and activity of mutants of HIV protease.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The long-term goal of the proposed work is to provide evidence that changes in iron homeostasis relate to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis or plaque buildup in arteries is the disease responsible for the vast majority of heart attacks, strokes, and events due to peripheral vascular disease that together cause death and disability for tens of millions of Americans. A relatively unexplored hypothesis explaining why women have a 10-20 year lag in onset of cardiovascular events due to atherosclerosis (CVD) is that monthly loss of iron is cardioprotective, and that cessation of menses at menopause accelerates CVD. Preventive approaches based on hormone therapy have been disappointing, causing increases in stroke and cardiovascular events instead of reductions. Additional motivation to investigate iron in CVD arises from recent evidence identifying the effects of inflammation and iron on hepcidin, the key regulator of macrophage iron uptake and release. Furthermore, iron catalyzes the generation of free radicals that oxidize cholesterol stimulating atheroma formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to study iron because of iron's local effects on magnetic susceptibility that can be quantified using a relaxation parameter called T2* (`T2-star'), as well as the ability to noninvasively characterize and quantify atherosclerotic plaque with MRI. Thus, we seek in this work to provide critical evidence to motivate the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics based on iron's role in atherosclerosis by achieving the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Measure changes in arterial wall magnetic susceptibility in perimenopausal women. Hypothesis 1a: Arterial wall T2* decreases in the transition from perimenopausal to postmenopausal status. Hypothesis 1b: Carotid artery wall T2* varies inversely with wall thickness and pulse wave velocity. Aim 2: Identify changes in iron uptake mechanisms in perimenopausal women. Hypothesis 2: Serum hepcidin increases in the transition from perimenopausal to postmenopausal status. Aim 3: Identify differences in iron homeostasis that can influence plaque magnetic susceptibility. Hypothesis 3a: In vivo carotid plaque T2* varies inversely with intraplaque ferritin content. Hypothesis 3b: Patients with symptom-producing carotid artery plaque undergoing surgery have higher serum hepcidin levels compared to asymptomatic patients with carotid artery plaque undergoing surgery. Aim 4: Identify mechanisms relating plaque biomarkers and iron homeostasis to plaque progression in patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis. Hypothesis 4: Change in T2* has a negative association with plaque progression in asymptomatic patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis not requiring surgery. Significance: If vascular iron is shown to increase in women post-menopause and in atherosclerosis progression, we will have identified a truly novel target to attenuate CVD risk in both men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis) causes heart attacks, strokes, and other complications that make heart and vascular disease the leading killer of Americans. Women tend to develop plaque buildup 10 to 20 years later than men. This research tests the theory that monthly loss of iron through menses is protective against atherosclerosis, which could lead to an entirely new approach to preventing and treating heart and vascular disease in both men and women.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The resurgence of tuberculosis and the spread of antibiotic resistant strains of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, present a significant public health challenge. Tuberculosis kills nearly 2 million people each year and estimates put the worldwide population of infected individuals at nearly 2 billion. A majority of these people (90%) carries latent, asymptomatic infections that reactivate causing disease and spread of M. tuberculosis to uninfected individuals. The latent phase and the slow growth rate of M. tuberculosis limit the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. One approach to treatment of tuberculosis would be to design drugs that inhibit the establishment of the latent phase or reactivate growth under conditions allowing aggressive treatment of the infection. This application proposes that uncharacterized toxin-antitoxin systems in M. tuberculosis may play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the latent phase of infection. The experiments are designed to (i) test the hypothesis that activation of these systems induces a static metabolic state in cells and (ii) identify the molecular targets of the toxins. These studies will lay the groundwork for a thorough analysis of the molecular biology of these toxin-antitoxin systems with the goal of designing therapeutic approaches to the treatment of latent M. tuberculosis infections.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for the effectiveness of community-based psychosocial treatments for adolescent substance use disorders is mixed, at best. Researchers' inability to detect strong or replicable treatment effects may result from their focus on the post-treatment effects of a single incident treatment episode. Recent conceptualizations of addiction and treatment suggest that these approaches which compare pre-post treatment effects may obscure some of treatment's most salient effects. For one, treatment effects should be expected to be greatest during treatment or concurrently. Second, from a treatment careers perspective, multiple treatment episodes over time are likely to lead to cumulative effects, which would be greater than those observed for any individual treatment episode. Finally, considerations of client heterogeneity suggest that effects of treatment may be greatest for a subgroup of patients (moderated effects), with such effects being obscured when combined with the smaller effects expected for other patients.  With this renewal we propose to estimate the causal effects of treatment on adolescent outcomes by examining these three types of treatment effects which addiction theory suggests have an important role, but which have yet to be satisfactorily measured.  To do so, we have assembled a large set of adolescent treatment outcomes data collected by RAND, the Center on Substance Abuse Treatment, and Chestnut Health Systems and which include background information, treatment outcomes and treatment histories for more than 10,000 adolescent treatment admissions. Using this rich data and a powerful new casual modeling technique for time-varying treatments, marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting, we propose four new aims: (1) Estimate the treatment effects of different levels of care on drug use and other outcomes observed while youths remain in treatment; (2) Estimate the causal effect of cumulative treatment experiences of different levels of care on 1-, 2-, and 6-year drug use and other outcomes; (3) Estimate how baseline and time-varying client characteristics moderate the concurrent and cumulative effects of level of care on recovery and substance use outcomes; and (4) Develop and evaluate statistical methods required for Aims 1 to 3, and compare findings to those produced using conventional treatment research methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to determine causal effects of treatment services for adolescents on drug use and other outcomes using powerful, new causal modeling techniques that allow us to study the concurrent effects of treatment, the cumulative effects of multiple treatment episodes, and differential effects for subgroups of clients. To accomplish this objective, we will use a large set of adolescent treatment outcomes data that has been collected by RAND, the Center on Substance Abuse Treatment, and Chestnut Health Systems, which includes treatment outcomes and treatment histories for more than 15,000 adolescent treatment admissions. By pursuing this research, we will improve the measurement and understanding of the effects of treatment and develop and disseminate more relevant and robust causal modeling approaches to substance abuse treatment services research than are currently standard in the field, thereby addressing key goals set by the 2004 Blue Ribbon Commission Task Force on Health Services Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Project Summary Anterior cervical fusion surgery effectively restores function and alleviates pain due to degenerative spine disease. However, the degeneration of motion segments adjacent to the fused cervical vertebrae (adjacent segment disease) is a concern for patients and surgeons. It has been proposed that mechanical factors, including excessive stress applied to adjacent motion segments, drive the progression of adjacent segment disease. Improved understanding of these mechanical factors associated with adjacent segment disease can best be obtained through collecting data in vivo during a variety of functional loading tasks. We propose to study the effects of cervical fusion on adjacent segment motion using a unique biplane radiographic imaging system capable of characterizing in vivo motion during functional loading. The biplane radiographic system will collect x-ray data at 50 frames per second as subjects perform cervical flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation movements. Three-dimensional bone motion will be accurately measured using both a dynamic RSA technique (bead-based tracking) and a validated markerless technique (model-based tracking). Anterior cervical fusion subjects will perform movement tests two times following surgery (6-9 months and 24 months post-surgery) to assess changes in overall vertebral motion (bone kinematics) and changes in relative motion between vertebral endplates (arthrokinematics) over time. Data collection during movement will allow us to quantify the dynamic stability/instability of the cervical spine throughout the range of motion. Arthrokinematic measurements of vertebral endplates will allow us to infer mechanical loading conditions applied to intervertebral discs (compression, shear, torsion) during functional loading. Fusion subject's vertebral movements will be compared to asymptomatic, age-matched control subject's vertebral movements. The proposed study will be the first to record precise, three-dimensional, in vivo movement of cervical vertebrae in asymptomatic subjects and anterior fusion patients. The first aim of the study is to identify specific kinematic and arthrokinematic measurements that differentiate between asymptomatic subjects and single- level anterior fusion patients during in vivo functional loading. The second aim is to identify changes in cervical vertebrae kinematics and arthrokinematics over time in the fusion patients. Finally, changes in fusion group kinematics and arthrokinematics will be correlated with patient outcome survey results and standard clinical measures of degenerative disc disease/spinal instability in order to relate abnormal vertebral movement to patient symptoms and clinical findings. Knowledge acquired from this study may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for patients afflicted with degenerative spine disease.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELAVANCE:     Project Narrative It has been reported that between 16% (Ishihara, 2004) and 25% (Hilibrand, 1999) of patients who have surgery to alleviate degenerative spine disease have new disease within 10 years of the operation. Abnormal spine movement following surgery may increase stress on adjacent portions of the spine and cause further spine degeneration. This project aims to identify abnormal neck bone movement that may be associated with degenerative spine disease following spine surgery.\",\n",
       " 'A number of pathogenic microorganisms, including, several NIAID Priority Pathogens, secrete virulencefactors utilizing a novel pathway referred to as the type VI secretion system (T6SS). The main objective ofthis project is to develop inhibitors of T6SS that could lead to a new class of antimicrobial agents.Burkholderia thailandensis will be used to identify T6SS inhibitors compounds in a high throughput screenand these will be tested for interference with secretion in several category A-C select agents, includingBurkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, causative agents of melioidosis and glanders,respectively.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vegrandis proposes to develop a rapid, sensitive, high throughput, inexpensive, and easy to use system for the ante-mortem diagnosis of prion infection. The proposed system offers a fully automated equipment with a disposable microelectrochemical cartridge for diagnosis of ante- mortem levels as low as 1 x 10-15 molar (possibly 1 x 10-21molar) concentrations of PrPSc in a rapid assay at d 30 min, high throughput allowing > 100 samples/h per fully automated instrument, high sensitivity with > 95% reliability (eliminating false positives and false negatives), and with minimal potential hazard of handling patient biological fluid. Unlike existing diagnostic methods of prion infection which are usable only when patients already show acute signs of neurologic dysfunctions and are provisional until post-mortem tissue homogenate diagnosis rules out or confirms the diagnosis, the proposed system is anticipated to diagnose asymptomatic stage prion infection that can be used for at least three important purposes: 1) eliminate contaminated animals and animal products from entering the market; 2) use in developing and monitoring the efficacy of drugs, vaccine, or other therapeutic molecules that are being developed; and 3) monitor changes in the PrPSc levels during medication. The proposed system will eliminate the use of post mortem tissue homogenates for diagnosis by allowing asymptomatic and ante-mortem diagnosis through the use of self-contained microelectro- chemistry in 50-micron diameter wells in a disposable cartridge (DC) format. The sample will be injected into the self-sealing inlet port on the DC, the DC will be inserted into the fully automated instrument, the reagents will be placed in the reagent module, and the proper program will be chosen. The instrument read out will display the concentration of PrPSc at the end of <30 min. During Phase I, Vegrandis will demonstrate the technology proof-of-concept by performing experiments using scrapie as the model analyte. Phase I is anticipated to:1) detect as low as femtomolar levels of PrPSc, 2) <45 min assay from capture to signal generation, 3) non- interference of debris from biological samples eliminating tedious sample preparation steps, and 4) low assay cost resulting from the use of small reagent volumes (d 10 <L for the entire microarray or ~0.5 <L per microwell). Achievement of the milestones in Phase I will advance the research to Phase II where we envision to a) develop a miniaturized flow injection instrument a high throughput fully automated detection of asymptomatic prion infection, b) achieve 1 x 10-21 molar PrPSc detection, and c) develop a 100-channel pico-ampere electrochemical analyzer for 100 sample analysis per hour total assay time. The same instruments and disposable cartridge will have use in stationary or mobile clinics or hospitals as a diagnostic tool for the early detection, ante- and post-mortem detection of prion disease. As additional details about prions and their antibodies become available, they will be incorporated into the disposable cartridge for further study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of cows are slaughtered annually for food in the United States. After the discovery of the first domestic case of mad cow disease in 2004, national US beef industry losses were recorded at $3.2 to $4.7 billion for that year alone. People have died worldwide from prion infection resulting from eating infected beef. Ante-mortem detection of prion infection will prevent the spread of this fatal disease that currently has no vaccine, antidote, or medicine to cure. Therefore, avoiding contamination is essential. Development of a fully automated, portable instrument that uses compact, disposable cartridges and requires no pre-analysis sample preparation for ante-mortem prion infection is proposed. Preliminary work indicates that the proposed approach will be able to meet the high sensitivity required to diagnose the asymptomatic stage of this fatal disease.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., with an overall 5 year survival rate of pound15%. The ability to detect early stage lesions in otherwise asymptomatic patients would increase the likelihood of survival. Recently, annual low-dose CT has been studied to determine its value for screening asymptomatic individuals that are at high risk for cancer (i.e., significant smoking history). However, the efficacy and effects of annual CT lung screening are largely unknown. There may be a risk associated with the CT screening process, as the use of ionizing radiation could potentially cause the development of tumors. We thus propose to determine the effect of clinically relevant CT screening procedures on the potential to cause radiation-induced carcinogenesis using three different mouse models of lung carcinogenesis. We will utilize a transgenic mouse model representative of the earliest stages of lung tumorigenesis and employ both a standard complete carcinogenesis and an initiation/promotion protocol of lung tumor formation, utilizing classes of chemical carcinogens that are prevalent in cigarette smoke and are implicated in lung tumor pathogenesis. We will also determine if the radiation doses received during routine whole-body or lung CT screening increase biomarkers of oxidative stress (pNF-kb, COX-2, iNOS, or carbonyl protein oxidation) that can be mechanistically related to any effects (or lack thereof) on lung tumor formation and/or promotion/progression. The resulting data will have a significant impact on the clinical use of CT in determining the risk of cancer development from clinical low-dose CT exposure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Annual low-dose CT has been recently studied to determine its value for screening asymptomatic individuals that are at high risk for lung cancer, however, the effects of annual CT lung screening are largely unknown. The proposed studies will determine if CT, a technique that could reduce the single biggest cause of cancer mortality in the US, can be justified as a screening tool to detect lung lesions in asymptomatic smokers and ex- smokers because the benefits outweigh the risk of radiation-induced lung cancer.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improved diagnoses of Chlamydia trachomatis infections represent a critical unmet medical need. C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans that causes blindness, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and is an important cofactor in transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infection rates associated with this pathogen make it the number one bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) worldwide. Many of these infections are asymptomatic, contributing to a large, silent epidemic. Current chlamydial diagnostics are primarily based on nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) that lack concordance across the different NAATs, vary in sensitivity (although specificity is high), are expensive, require technical expertise, take days for results (especially with batch processing), and are usually confined to major clinical or reference laboratories. They are also unable to differentiate between invasive lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) versus non-invasive strains D to K, the former of which require weeks of antibiotic therapy for eradication. Network Biosystems (NetBio) is proposing to develop an inexpensive microfluidics-based diagnostic for C. trachomatis, including test-of-cure, that will provide sensitive and specific detection and discrimination of strain types to enable clinical decisions to be made in real time. Development of such an effective point-of-care diagnostic could result in widespread screening efforts for detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and appropriate treatment that would not only reduce the acute and chronic morbidity that is directly associated with these infections but could also reduce potential collateral risks associated with C. trachomatis infections, including HIV-1 infection, cervical cancer and autoimmune-driven arthritis. The Specific Aims, then, of this Phase I application are to: 1) Develop a rapid method for genomic DNA extraction from clinical urethral and cervical samples; 2) Design at least two primer pairs that are sensitive and specific for C. trachomatis amplification at two loci; and 3) Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the microfluidics diagnostic for C. trachomatis compared to a current NAAT. In the SBIR Phase II, we will: 1) Expand our methods to extract genomic DNA from conjunctival, pharyngeal, urine, ulcer, vaginal and rectal samples; 2) Expand our primer design to identify strain types based on comparative genomics of reference and clinical chlamydial STD strains (essential for directing therapy for invasive versus non-invasive C. trachomatis strains and for epidemiologic studies); 3) Secure patents for FDA approval; 4) Design a head-to-head clinical study of our diagnostic against leading commercial diagnostics using clinical samples from diverse geographic populations at risk for chlamydial STDs. Given the genomic expertise of Drs. Tim Read and Deborah Dean for developing target gene primer pairs and the chlamydial STD expertise of Dr. Dean, the application provides a unique collaborative opportunity to finally obtain a rapid point-of-care diagnostic for C. trachomatis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading bacterial cause of sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Many of these infections are asymptomatic and go undetected, which leads to increased transmission and the sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Current diagnostics require extensive technical expertise, are expensive and take days for results, leading to loss of follow up. Additionally, more dangerous strains that require longer treatment cannot be detected. Network Biosystems aims to develop an easy to use, cost effective, one hour diagnostic for C. trachomatis that also differentiates strains types for appropriate treatment.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection of humans with Plasmodium species, the parasites that cause malaria, remains a significant global health problem. There are approximately 300-500 million new cases of malaria each year, which results in the death of 1-3 million people annually. Vaccine development is complicated by the complex life cycle of Plasmodium, which exists as an asymptomatic liver-stage followed by a symptomatic blood-stage. Since the liver-stage is asymptomatic the most ideal vaccine would target and eliminate the parasite at this stage. Previous research has shown that the immune system uses both antibodies and T cells to prevent infection of or eliminate infected hepatocytes respectively. Unfortunately, there is little information regarding the quantitative requirements for antibodies and T cells in providing protection from infection, which would serve as an important benchmark for malaria vaccine development. The research in this proposal will fill this knowledge gap, thus providing valuable information in the rationale design of an effective malaria vaccine. In previous work it has been shown that the threshold of CDS T cells required for sterile Plasmodium liver-stage immunity is >1% of all peripheral blood leukocytes. In Specific Aim 1 of this proposal Plasmodium-specific antibodies or CD4 T cell responses will be added to an existing CDS T cell response to determine the effect on the threshold of CDS T cells required for sterile immunity. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if an optimal relationship between Plasmodium-specific antibodies, CD4 T cells, and CDS T cells can be defined. These experiments have direct relevance to the mission of the NIAID because they will lead towards the prevention of Plasmodium infections. Thus, this research is of significant interest to public health because it will provide important information in the development of a vaccine for malaria.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the currently approved NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etrivirine) are highly potent, significant improvements in therapeutic utility are still required. A new generation of NNRTIS must be developed which will allow once per day dosing, exhibit significantly reduced toxicity, be amenable to dosing in woman of child bearing age, and possess a significantly higher genetic barrier to resistance selection. NNRTIs being developed by Tibotec (Etrivirine) and Idenix (IDX-899) appear to possess many of these promising therapeutic properties and these compounds are currently approved for use or entering Phase 3 human clinical trials. Structure-activity relationship data obtained with the pyrimidinediones indicates that a next generation pyrimidinedione may also be expected to meet and potentially exceed these necessary properties for a next generation NNRTI and a variety of initial lead compounds have been identified for further development. The pyrimidinediones are amenable to once per day dosing with plasma blood concentrations in excess of 20-times the required EC95 concentration achieved at 24 hours post-dosing. Additionally, ImQuest has initiated studies to optimize the formulation and delivery of IQP-0410 and preliminary results suggest further enhancement to this trough drug concentration. The pyrimidinediones have been dosed in mice, rats and dogs at concentrations of up to 2000 mg/kg/day without any overt or microscopic pathologic signs of toxicity suggesting that the compounds will likely be very safe in humans, and thus may be clinically useful in woman of child bearing age. Most importantly, the pyrimidinediones would be expected to possess an extremely high genetic barrier to resistance based on preliminary antiviral data against common problematic NNRTI-resistant and MDR viruses as well as the defined second mechanism of action of the pyrimidinediones. Though our current lead compound IQP-0410 appears to have favorable activity against these drug resistant strains, additional analogs have been identified with much more potency against drug resistant strains. Among the pyrimidinedione series of molecules, the apparent initial limit to resistance with NNRTI-resistance engendering mutations is approximately 100- to 200-fold since at that concentration level, the replication of NNRTI-resistant virus is suppressed through the entry inhibitory mechanism. Thus, in order to achieve high level resistance to the pyrimidinediones we have shown that multiple mutations must accumulate in the reverse transcriptase AND mutations must appear in both gp120 and gp41, enabling a high genetic barrier to resistance selection.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this proposal is to define new lead therapeutic candidate compounds with the highest possible potency against NNRTI-resistant and MDR viruses. Lead compounds with greater potency against these viruses have been identified through our SAR evaluations, and these compounds will be further modified using standard medicinal chemistry to improve their activity against resistant viruses, to improve their solubility, and to improve their overall oral bioavailability. Enhanced potency of the pyrimidinediones may be achieved by identifying compounds with greater molecular flexibility allowing them to better bind to the hydrophobic NNRTI-binding pocket in the presence of NNRTI resistance-engendering mutations, as well as by identifying modifications which enhance the ability of the compounds to inhibit virus entry. Modifications which improve solubility and bioavailability are also expected to allow enhancements to our dosing regimen to drive further improvements in compound efficacy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Overweight and obese adults are more likely to have hypertension and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence-based medication and lifestyle strategies can be used to decrease CVD risk, but little is known about the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these strategies and how best to integrate them into routine health care. We have previously demonstrated that Web-based pharmacist medication management intervention can cost-effectively improve HTN control (e-BP: Electronic Communication and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring; R01 HL075263, B. Green, PI). Web-based pharmacy care did not lead to lifestyle behavior change or weight loss. However patients who lost small amounts of weight (2 kg or more) were more likely to have controlled BP (p=.008), regardless of their study group assignment. We propose to use Health Information Technology systems (HIT) to identify asymptomatic patients at moderate risk for CVD and invite them to participate in a theory-based behavioral intervention. Aim #1: We hypothesize that using electronic databases alone, we can identify asymptomatic overweight or obese patients, with uncontrolled BP, and at moderate risk for CVD who might benefit from a behavioral intervention. To test this hypothesis we will measure: Primary outcomes:   The proportion of asymptomatic patients with data for BMI, BP, lipids, and tobacco use   The proportion at moderate risk for CVD (using Framingham risk scores) and the independent effect of obesity on Framingham risk scores. Secondary outcome:   The marginal costs related to moderate risk for CVD with and without obesity. Aim #2: We hypothesize that a dietitian-delivered behavioral intervention, that uses a patient shared EMR and e-communications, can be integrated into routine healthcare and will result in improved control of modifiable CVD risk. To test this hypothesis we will measure: Primary outcomes:   The proportion of patients who agree to participate and complete the intervention   The change in mean systolic and diastolic BP and weight (kg), and a weight loss of 4 kg or more, and the change in Framingham risk score. Secondary outcomes:   Patient satisfaction with the intervention, its effects on health related quality of life (HrQOL) and the cost of delivering the intervention. Adults with high blood pressure (BP) and obesity are at higher risk for heart disease and strokes. A recent study (e-BP) showed that patients who monitored their BP at home and received pharmacist care over the Web had improved BP control. We will be studying whether similar care delivered by dietitians over the Web leads to improved BP control and weight loss.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current application is written as a response to requests for applications in the area of NIH Challenge Grants in Health and Science Research (RC1) in the Broad Challenge Area of (04) CLINICAL RESEARCH, Specific Challenge Area: 04-HL-104 - To perform secondary analyses of existing data to answer important clinical and preventive medicine research questions, specifically to determine the cost effectiveness of preventive interventions. This Secondary Data Analysis: The Economic Consequences of Advanced Testing for Subclinical Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is proposed to be completed in the NIH- NHLBI-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Despite the burden of CVD, routine testing beyond measurement of cholesterol, is not considered of medical necessity and supported by national healthcare coverage decisions. Recent technology evaluations by the US Preventive Services Taskforce and others have voiced strong concerns over the untoward consequences of additional CVD testing (beyond measurement of cholesterol) including the potential for unwarranted, induced testing and a lifelong stigma and anxiety following a diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis. Past arguments have cautioned over embarking on nationwide screening for CVD due to a lack of high quality evidence on improved risk detection. Recent data from large patient registries and population series report a high degree of prognostic accuracy for CAC, Hs-CRP, and C-IMT; including the recently results from the NIH-NHLBI-sponsored MESA revealing effective risk stratification of women and men of diverse ethnicity from geographically-diverse regions of this country. Yet, concerns remain that testing will beget more testing and initiation of a strategy for detection of markers for subclinical atherosclerosis may result in early and lifelong higher patterns of resource consumption that would not have been realized without the initial documentation of measureable subclinical CVD. Accordingly, high quality evidence unfolding the cost implications of CVD testing is necessary in order to frame the frequently reported improved detection of risk within the context of the potential untoward sequelae of testing where excessive costs exceed any derivable benefit. However, meaningful data on  real world  resource consumption patterns and healthcare costs following subclinical CVD testing in asymptomatic individuals is limited; principally comprised of decision models or small patient series. Challenges within the field of cost effectiveness of testing in asymptomatics include reliance upon decision modeling lacking input from  real world  resource utilization; rendering the modeling results difficult to interpret. For example, models that indicate a sizeable cost savings for strategies guided by Hs-CRP or CAC results may be optimistic and fail to consider the untoward consequences of testing or costs which may ensue for less extensive abnormalities or from test layering. The data available in MESA represents a sizeable step forward in our knowledge base of induced patterns of testing and treatment from a large cohort of middle-aged and elderly adults. We propose to examine downstream costs using a resource-based methodology in a large population cohort of adults enrolled in the MESA. Our application includes a systematic approach to cost analysis based on Medicare reimbursement rates for estimating 4-5 year CVD costs. Our analytical approach will be to compare costs within the context of the added benefit of advanced CVD testing including improved risk re-classification as well as the cumulative costs (including those associated with incidental findings and expected radiation- induced cancers). We propose that an analytic approach that emulates iterative steps in risk detection initially classifying outcome based on the FRS followed by a given advanced testing option. Thus, allowing for calculation of the incremental costs in relation to the added benefit of improved classification of risk or risk re- classification; using recent approaches described by Pencina and Wilson. We propose a novel, disease- specific cost effectiveness metric of cost per net reclassification of CVD events (i.e., the cost per 1 new CVD event detected with advanced CVD testing when compared to the FRS). Our analytical approach is both iterative and strategy based examining costs associated with an FRS strategy compared with a strategy with one or more of our advanced tests (CAC scoring, C-IMT, or Hs-CRP). We believe that this novel cost effectiveness metric more closely corresponds to more recent risk classification approaches and distinguishes the added cost and benefit of advanced testing compared with the standard FRS. Limited information is available to inform public policy with regards to the economic consequences of advanced testing for subclinical CVD ensuing following index testing using either laboratory, such as Hs-CRP, or imaging biomarkers, such as CAC scoring. Given the paucity of available data, the current application of secondary data analysis in MESA identifying resource consumption patterns and estimating downstream costs of care can provide a tremendous step forward in the quality of available evidence. This current evaluation empowers MESA with an unparalleled potential to identify the most efficient and accurate methods for CVD testing in asymptomatic individuals. The current application combines exceptional clinical outcomes, imaging, and economic expertise put forth in the evaluation of available MESA data to advance our understanding of the clinical and economic benefits and risk associated with CVD testing in asymptomatic individuals. The current study aims to evaluate 5-year cost for heart disease care in over 6 thousand individuals. We further propose to compare costs of heart disease care in subgroups of adults with low to high risk cardiac biomarkers. We will compare costs in addition to the added benefit of improved detection of heart disease risk using several cardiac biomarkers.',\n",
       " 'Gene therapy has vast potential for treating and potentially curing a wide variety of disorders. However,gene delivery technologies require significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and expression stabilitybefore the majority of these diseases can be treated. Vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) haveproven themselves to be highly promising, both in the laboratory and the clinic, but they still suffer fromseveral shortcomings. In particular, the majority of the human population has been exposed to AAVserotype 2, as well as other serotypes, and as a result the immune system is primed to neutralize AAV.Antibody neutralization of AAV vectors is an established problem, and cellular immune responses may alsobe a challenge. We will attempt to solve the former problem and will further investigate basic mechanismsinvolved in the latter. For the former, we have developed novel directed evolution technology to generatenew mutants of AAV with new properties. Specifically, large libraries of virus with random point mutations inthe capsid gene encoding the viral coat protein are generated, and variants with novel properties areselected using high throughput screens. We have utilized this approach to generate variants with alteredreceptor binding properties, as well as variants that escape neutralization by antibodies that greatly inhibitAAV gene delivery by the wild type capsid or coat proteins. We will study the potential of human antibodyevading variants to mediate high efficiency gene delivery of the therapeutic gene erythropoietin to the muscleand liver of animals carrying anti-AAV antibodies. In addition, while AAV neutralization by antibodies is anestablished problem, much less is known about AAV interactions with other components of the immunesystem. Therefore, the basic mechanisms of immune neutralization of this virus by complement [and T cells]will be investigated to both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, viruses have naturally evolved for their ownends, which do not always meet the needs of a human therapeutic. The novel approaches developed in thiswork to re-evolve viruses into enhanced human therapeutics will therefore have broad and general impact onthe molecular engineering of enhanced viral gene delivery vehicles, including alternate AAV serotypes aswell as other vectors. Furthermore, it will yield insights into the responses of other immune systemcomponents to AAV.',\n",
       " 'Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)/lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a disease that significantlyaffects the quality of life in aging men. Though BPH has been well recognized to present itself assymptomatic or asymptomatic disease, the two forms were thought to be indistinguishable at the molecularlevel. To elucidate the molecular differences underlying BPH, gene expression profiles from the prostatetransition zone were analyzed using microarrays. These results identified several genes that appear todifferentiate BPH from individuals with severe symptoms from those with asymptomatic BPH. Thisapplication focuses on one of these genes namely, JI^-27. JM-27 (also known as PAGE4/GAGEC1) isremarl<ably specific to the prostate in males and is expressed in symptomatic but not asymptomatic BPH.JI\\\\/l-27 is also expressed in BPH from individuals with prostate cancer and furthermore, appears to bepreferentially expressed only in the stroma. We hypothesize that JM-27 is a stromal cell regulator of prostaticgrowth and its overexpression is associated with symptomatic BPH. This hypothesis will be addressed byaccomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to comprehensively analyze the expression of JM-27 protein innormal adult prostate, fetal prostate, prostate cancer as well as in symptomatic and asymptomatic BPHtissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, 2)to further evaluate the ability ofserum JM-27 expression to differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic BPH using the ELISA protocol wehave developed, and 3) using this ELISA, to analyze the entire To samples from individuals that participatein the NIDDK MTOPS study and to determine the ability of serum-based JM-27 to identify individuals thatprogress with their disease as well as those that respond to the therapeutic modalities. These data couldprovide novel approaches for the early identification of individuals with the form of BPH/LUTS that results insevere symptoms providing for an opportunity for therapeutic intervention as well as to characterize, at themolecular level, those that respond or fail to respond to current treatments.',\n",

Bosentan is an endothelin-1 antagonist which showed significant improvement in distance walked during 12 week clinical trials in PAH patients (7).

Although it is recognized that DME gene expression is upregulated in the presence of their substrates, insights into the mechanisms of this induction have only recently been obtained. The nuclear receptor (NR) PXR has been implicated as a key mediator of xenobiotic induction of DME expression in several vertebrate species. This discovery broadened the known biology attributed to the NR superfamily; namely, that NRs not only regulate transcription in response to endogenous signals but also in response to the presence of chemical signals from the environment. To date, searches for transcriptional targets for PXR and other  xenobiotic sensing  NRs have generally revealed members of DME gene families. Thus, discovery of the entire suite of genes regulated by these NRs will illuminate the various metabolic pathways elicited by xenobiotics. This knowledge, in turn, will provide the requisite information needed for the prediction of drug-drug and drug-environment interactions that often result in dramatically modified efficacy of prescription drugs. The discovery of NR regulated DME expression, coupled with the advent of genome sequencing projects and modern genomics tools, makes the use of a toxicogenomics approach to reveal the complete description of loci upregulated via NRs in response to compounds in our drugs, diet, and environment an appealing possibility. Within the C. elegans genome are more than 260 NRs including several that are closely related to PXR. Among these PXR-related NRs is NHR-8, which C. elegans requires for wild type resistance to xenobiotics. The role of NHR-8 in xenobiotic resistance suggests that like its vertebrate homolog, NHR-8 responds to the presence of xenobiotic toxic compounds by upregulating the expression of a detoxification network to remove the offending compounds.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal describes the 5-year training program for Dr. Elliott R. Haut. The proposal builds upon the candidate's strengths and prior research skills, while utilizing the unique opportunities of The Johns Hopkins University. The mentorship of Dr. Peter Pronovost and formal advanced degree coursework in the Graduate Training Program in Clinical Investigation (GTPCI), will give Dr. Haut the tools and training to advance to the level of a fully independent health services researcher. Pay for performance and public reporting of quality are growing exponentially in medicine. Implicit in these systems is the assumed presence of a valid way to measure clinical quality. Many national agencies (AHRQ, NQF) have suggested deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence as a metric of health care quality. DVT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients, yet may be completely asymptomatic until the clot embolizes and causes sudden death from massive pulmonary embolism. Duplex ultrasound serves an important role as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DVT detection. However, screening asymptomatic trauma patients for DVT is controversial, these practices likely vary widely among hospitals, and no national agency has recommended a standardized screening approach. In the absence of standardized surveillance, DVT rates may be influenced more by how often caregivers look for these events rather than the quality of care provided. This is a classic example of surveillance bias in which event rates identified and reported may merely reflect levels of vigilance. Higher DVT rates may not be a marker of poor quality of care, but rather an outcome of more aggressive screening practices. Providers who look harder by ordering more screening duplex ultrasounds, may report higher rates of DVT, and appear to provide poorer quality of care than those providers who do not screen. Therefore, DVT rates reported may be unreliable measures of quality of care and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives. SA#1 will examine the impact of hospital-level ultrasound rates on DVT rates reported after major trauma. SA#2 will determine whether hospital duplex and DVT rates correlate with the presence of a hospital duplex ultrasound screening protocol for high-risk trauma patients. SA#3 will determine if patients are more likely to have DVT diagnosed and reported based on hospital characteristics, controlling for patient-level DVT risk factors using multi-level multiple logistic regression. Some hospitals use duplex ultrasound to screen asymptomatic trauma patients for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) while other hospitals do not. Hospitals that screen trauma patients may identify and report higher DVT rates merely because they search for DVTs more aggressively. Therefore, reported DVT rates are unreliable quality of care measures and should not be used to compare hospitals or for pay-for-performance initiatives.\",\n",
       " 'Overexpression of the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), renders cancer cells resistant to multiple drugs, and it is one of the major causes for the failure of chemotherapeutic treatments.  P-gp is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and functions as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump that expels anti-neoplastic drugs from cancer cells.  Expression of P-gp has been detected in a significant percentage of breast cancers and is increased after exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs.  Researchers have tried various approaches to circumvent multidrug resistance, and many of these strategies have focused on the suppression of P-gp.  Our concept involves a new strategy that aims to exploit the overexpression of P-gp by breast cancer cells.  Our hypothesis is that drug delivery complexes can be targeted to cells that overexpress P-gp, and that P-gp can serve as an anchor for these complexes and allow localized delivery of therapeutic agents.  We intend to design and create drug delivery complexes that will transport therapeutic drugs to tumor sites, span the cellular membrane, and interact with P-gp through known associations, tethering the complex to cells overexpressing P-gp and facilitating treatment, thereby improving the therapeutic index of an anti-cancer drug.',\n",

Barley has unique properties as a human food, as an animal feed, and - of course - as the base of beer. Researchers in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin are leveraging Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) funds to systematically characterize the genes, proteins, and metabolic pathways involved in malting quality in contemporary and ancestral barley germplasm. Genetic resistance is the most cost-effective and environmentally sound approach to controlling diseases. By locating and characterizing the genes that confer resistance, and understanding how these genes work, researchers in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Washington are developing tools for resistance breeding that will benefit all of American agriculture. Genetic resistance is also the most cost-effective and environmentally sound approach to dealing with abiotic stresses.

       " \"A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiol's antidepressant efficacy in perimenopausal depression.  Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop depression during the perimenopause.  In these studies, first we examine the effects of estradiol withdrawal and the recent onset of hypogonadism on mood symptoms in asymptomatic premenopausal women.  Second, we investigate what factors influence the development of depression during estradiol withdrawal.We administered a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for two to three months to 60 regular cycling, asymptomatic, healthy, premenopausal women (age - mean (SD) = 33.4 (8.1) years).  Only three women (5.0% of the sample) reported clinically significant symptoms of depression.  In contrast to the relative absence of depressive symptoms in these women, we did observe the significant appearance of several symptoms including hot flushes, disturbed sleep, and diminished libido.  The latter finding is consistent with a prior study performed in a smaller subsample of these women in whom significant reductions in libido (as measured by a modified Derogatis Inventory of Sexual Functioning Scale) was observed in approximately 30% of the sample.  Thus, in otherwise healthy women, the induction of neither hypogonadism nor hot flushes (with an accompanying sleep disturbance) uniformly precipitates depressive symptoms.In these studies, we also investigate two factors that could impact the appearance of depression during estradiol withdrawal - age and a previous episode of depression.  We evaluate the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in older postmenopausal women with and those without a past perimenopausal depression.  Preliminary results suggest that estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with a past perimenopausal depression, but not in those without such a history.  In women with a past depression during the perimenopause, estradiol withdrawal is associated with a significant increase in depressive symptoms compared with those women who were maintained on estradiol therapy under double-blind conditions.  Additionally, no significant depressive symptoms emerged in the women lacking a history of depression who were either withdrawn or maintained on estradiol therapy.  Thus, in contrast to our findings with GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism in premenopausal women with no past psychiatric history, estradiol withdrawal in women with a history of perimenopausal depression triggers mood symptoms.  These data are consistent with those from epidemiologic studies showing that, for a subgroup of women, the endocrine events of the late menopause transition may represent important triggers for mood destabilization and the onset of depression.  Both the markers of this risk and the mechanisms underlying estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms remain to be identified.Depressive symptoms emerged during estradiol withdrawal only in the older women with a past depression during the perimenopause, but not in either the younger or older women with no past depressions.  Thus, during estradiol withdrawal, the ages of the women appear to be less of a contributor to the development of depressive symptoms than a past episode of depression.  In a second ongoing study, we are investigating the impact of a past depression (not related to the perimenopause) on the effects of estradiol withdrawal on mood.  Preliminary observations suggest that GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism in asymptomatic premenopausal women with a past episode of depression is accompanied by the onset of depressive symptoms.  If confirmed in a larger sample, these data suggest that in contrast to the effects of GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism observed in asymptomatic premenopausal women with no history of depression, a single episode of depression (whether related to the perimenopause or not) could increase a womans susceptibility to develop negative mood symptoms during induced hypogonadism/estradiol withdrawal.The results of the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) have deterred many women from using estrogen therapy.  Although considerable controversy exists regarding the applicability of the WHIs findings to younger perimenopausal women, many women and their physicians are concerned about the long-term risks of estrogen therapy.  In a previous study, we demonstrated the antidepressant effects of the short-term administration of estradiol in women with perimenopausal depression.  In an ongoing study, we now are examining the effects on mood and behavior of two compounds that for many women represent alternatives to traditional estrogen therapy.  Specifically, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and phytoestrogens (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds) have become available and are reported to display both tissue-specific profiles of estrogen agonist and antagonist actions and differential affinities from estradiol for the two forms of estrogen receptor.  For many women, these novel compounds represent safer alternatives to estrogen therapy for the prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly, the treatment of perimenopausal symptoms.  The use of SERMs and phytoestrogens may be preferred given their more favorable patterns of side effects, their lower risk of stimulating breast and endometrial cancers, and the perception that some of these compounds (phytoestrogens) are dietary supplements.Preliminary results demonstrate that after eight weeks of either estradiol or raloxifene, mood rating scores were significantly decreased compared with baseline scores and significantly lower than scores in women receiving placebo.  Women receiving either phytoestrogen or placebo showed no significant improvement compared with their baseline scores.  If confirmed in a larger sample of women, raloxifenes equal efficacy to that of estradiol would provide an alternative therapeutic option with a more acceptable profile of long-term side effects.In future studies, we intend to investigate the behavioral relevance of estrogen receptor beta in humans.  Specifically, we will examine the antidepressant/anxiolytic efficacy of selective estrogen receptor beta agonists (when available for human use) in women with perimenopausal depression.  These data will not only establish the role of estrogen receptor beta in the mechanism of estradiols antidepressant action, but could identify a promising new class of therapeutic agents that are safer and more acceptable than estrogen and potentially lack the side effects or withdrawal syndromes associated with traditional psychotropics.  Finally, the comparison of the mood and behavioral effects of raloxifene and phytoestrogens to that of estradiol may allow more precise inferences to be made about the specific brain regions and estrogen receptor subtypes involved in estradiols antidepressant effects.  Additionally, it is possible that the selectivity of these compounds for estrogen receptor alpha and beta may identify the mechanisms of efficacy of estradiol on specific target symptoms.  Finally, as phytoestrogens are already commonly recommended, well accepted, and widely used for the treatment of mood symptoms, further clarification of their mood effects could have significant public health implications.\",\n",
       " 'Dengue serotype 1 vaccine development: The live attenuated DEN1 vaccine candidate virus rDEN1del30 has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and was found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies have been fully enrolled to determine the number of doses and the timing of the two doses needed to achieve optimal immunization. The studies involve two doses of vaccine given at an interval of 4 or 6 months. The results will be fully reported pending complete analysis, but preliminary analysis indicates that the first dose is highly immunogenic but the second dose is poorly infectious at 6 months. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned. Dengue serotype 2 vaccine development: rDEN2/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine, rDEN4del30, have been replaced by those of the prototypic DEN2 NGC virus. The live attenuated DEN2 vaccine candidate virus rDEN2/4del30(ME) has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies are in progress to address the number and timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate.  Enrollment is not complete, and results of the trial will be reported pending completion. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned. Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development; rDEN3/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine rDEN430 have been replaced by those of a DEN3 wild type virus. rDEN3/4del30(ME) or placebo was evaluated at a dose of 1,000 or 100,000 PFU in 28 healthy dengue-naive adult volunteers per dose. Less than 40% of vaccinees were infected with either dose indicating this vaccine candidate is not sufficiently infectious to be used as a component of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Studies have been initiated with an additional DEN3 vaccine candidate in which the DEN3-UTR (untranslated region) has been replaced with that of DEN4del30, and initial trials indicate the virus is safe and more infectious than rDEN3/4del30(ME) and that it can be used as the DEN3 component of a tetravalent  vaccine. Dengue serotype 4 vaccine development: rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 is a live attenuated DENV-4 vaccine candidate specifically designed to further attenuate the rDEN4&#8710;30 parent virus.  In a previous study, 5 of 20 vaccinees who received rDEN4&#8710;30 at 100,000 PFU developed moderately elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  Mutational analysis of DENV-4 revealed that the 200,201 mutation of NS5 greatly restricted virus replication in human hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cells.  In pre-clinical animal studies, the vaccine candidate rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 was shown to be more attenuated than rDEN4&#8710;30 in both SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus macaques. In the present study, twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive either 100,000 PFU of vaccine (20) or placebo (8) as a single subcutaneous injection.  The vaccine infected all vaccinees and was well tolerated without inducing ALT elevations.  Although virus was not recovered from the serum of any vaccinee, moderate levels of neutralizing antibody were induced.  The restricted replication of rDEN430-200,201 in SCID HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys was also observed in humans, thus validating the pre-clinical approach of selecting a mutant virus with a decreased level of replication in human liver cells.  rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 is a promising candidate and can be considered for inclusion in a tetravalent DEN virus vaccine. We currently consider the rDEN4del30 vaccine our DEN4 leading candidate for inclusion in the tetravalent vaccine for two reasons. At a proposed dose of 1000 PFU, it is economical to produce and has an acceptable safety profile; and, rDEN4del30 appears slightly more immunogenic in humans than rDEN4del30-200,201; this greater immunogenicity likely would translate into a more durable immunity. A second candidate is rDEN4del30-4995. rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 is a live attenuated dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) vaccine candidate specifically designed as a further attenuated derivative of the rDEN4&#8710;30 parent virus.   In a previous study, 5/20 vaccinees who received 100,000 plaque forming units (PFU) of rDEN4&#8710;30 developed a transient serum ALT elevation and 10/20 developed an asymptomatic maculopapular rash.  In the current study, 28 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive 100,000 PFU of rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 (20) or placebo (8) as a single subcutaneous injection.  The vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. An asymptomatic generalized maculopapular rash and elevations in ALT levels were observed in 10% of the rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 vaccinees. None of the rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 volunteers became viremic, yet 95% developed a four-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers.  Thus rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 was demonstrated to be safe, highly attenuated, and immunogenic. However, an asymptomatic localized erythematous rash at the injection site was seen in 17/20 rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 vaccinees, and, therefore, alternative DEN4 vaccine strains were selected for further clinical development.  Two tetravalent formulations will be evaluated in humans in the next FY.  One will consist of rDEN1del30, rDEN2/4del30(ME), rDEN3-3Ddel30, and DEN4-del30 and the second will have rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 as the DEN4 component.  An additional study designed to evaluate the safety of our DEN vaccine viruses in subjects immune to a heterologous dengue virus has been completed, and the data is being analyzed. Preliminary analysis of this trial, in which four combinations of heterologous first and second vaccines were studied, indicated that the vaccine viruses were infectious, safe, and immunogenic in the presence of preexisting heterologous immunity.  Only one of the four combinations showed increased replication of vaccine virus, an expected finding in which preexisting immunity enhances virus replication, but this small increase in viremia was not accompanied by an increase in signs or symptoms of dengue virus disease. West Nile virus vaccine development  trials in humans: Phase I trials are ongoing with a live attenuated West Nile virus vaccine candidate, WNVDEN4del30. Studies at 1000 and 100,000 infectious units per vaccinee indicated the vaccine was safe with low viremia, but was immunogenic in only 80% of vaccinees. To achieve a higher take rate, a study is ongoing in which two doses of 100,000 infectious units are given six months apart.  The study is fully enrolled, and preliminary analysis indicates that the vaccine given as two doses is safe and immunogenic with up to 100% of vaccinees developing a rise in neutralizing antibody titer.',\n",
       " 'This contract (Southern Research Institute) provides a resource for conducting preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and metabolism studies with candidate therapeutic agents selected for development by the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI. Most of the compounds selected are potential anticancer agents (including those relevant to orphan cancers), but some are putative therapeutics for a wide range of prevalent and orphan human diseases. Compounds selected for study under this contract may arise from a variety of peer-reviewed extramural sources such as the Division of Cancer Treatment Drug Development Group (DDG) for potential NCI-held Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and the Rapid Access to Intervention Development (RAID) and Rapid Access to NCI Discovery Resources (R*A*N*D) Programs for investigator-held INDs. In addition, development projects also arise from other pipelines such as the NCI Development of Clinical Imaging Agents and Enhancers (DCIDE) program, the NIDDK Type-1 Diabetes RAID program, and the NIH Roadmap RAID Program (which provides support for development of candidate agents in many therapeutic categories). The NCI intramural program is a source of anticancer compounds for study. Work carried out under the contract may include: (1) development of analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, and other biological matrices at levels corresponding to the expected therapeutic and/or toxic range; (2) plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of animal studies; (3) pharmacokinetic characterization following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of oral bioavailability where appropriate; (4) quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (e.g., S9 fractions, microsomes, hepatocytes, P450 isoforms, liver slices); and (5) assessment of pharmacodynamic effects in tumor or surrogate tissues and correlation of these effects with drug levels and/or total drug exposures. It is anticipated that the data obtained from these pharmacokinetic investigations will be useful in the design of preclinical efficacy and toxicology studies and Phase I clinical trials of selected agents. Technical reports submitted by the contractors will be included in INDs submitted to the FDA by the NCI or other institutions.',\n",
       " '1032328Conroy Wastewater contains pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, personal care products, and emerging contaminants originating from human waste and other activities. Endocrine disruptors encompass a wide array of chemicals, including human hormones, phytoestrogens, and flame retardants, among others. Once these chemicals enter wastewater treatment facilities, their fates vary depending on the treatment techniques present. Standard wastewater treatment has not been designed to treat such contaminants, as human and synthetic hormones are only partially degraded during secondary (biological) treatment. The bacteria present in wastewater treatment are exposed to all classes of emerging contaminants, including antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria populations are becoming more common in wastewater treatment. Recently, hormones have been shown to be substrates for major classes of antibiotic pumps, leading to hormone resistance. Here, it is hypothesized that hormones are inefficiently degraded by bacteria because they are exported out of the cell by antibiotic resistance proteins before encountering oxidizing proteins. The suspected proteins involved in hormone oxidation are oxygenases, which insert a hydroxyl moiety onto a carbon chain. This BRIGE award will investigate whether the lack of degradation of endocrine disrupting compounds in secondary biological treatment is due to hormone resistance. The proposed work encompasses three main tasks: (1) Various endocrine disrupting compounds, both estrogenic and androgenic, will be tested as substrates for the major Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) antibiotic pump AcrAB-TolC in e. coli; (2) Numerous classes of monooxygenase and dioxygenase genes will be cloned into e. coli; and (3) endocrine disrupting compound degradation will be tested in e. coli strains expressing and lacking oxygenase genes. Intellectual Merit: If the outlined activities are successful, bacteria populations may be engineered to efficiently degrade hormone and other endocrine disruptors. Pure culture batch reactors will be constructed, studied, and re-designed to incorporate other bacteria populations required for adequate wastewater treatment. These results have significant implications for the reduction of endocrine disrupting compounds released into the environment. Broader Impacts: The anticipated results will explain why endocrine disrupting compounds survive wastewater treatment. To determine if this hypothesis is valid, bacteria populations and hormone concentrations will be evaluated at local wastewater treatment facilities. Sample collection will occur in the metropolitan Salt Lake City area, rural treatment works, and from tribal lands. Working in an environmental capacity with Tribal entities requires special permission from their respective leaders. A research protocol will be developed on behalf of the University of Utah which will outline the steps required to pursue such research. Sampling on tribal lands will incorporate educational and research opportunities for interested community members, including high-school students.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to conduct a Stage II randomized trial to test Culturally Informed & Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) a treatment developed as part of a Stage I treatment development effort and showing very promising preliminary findings. Drug use rate are highest among Hispanic middle school youth and to date there are few if any treatments that have been proven effective with substance abusing Hispanic adolescents. Further treatment for Hispanic youth and families is complicated by the fact that these families often differ from mainstream drug users in values, beliefs and behaviors that can directly impact engagement, retention, and efficacy/effectiveness of drug treatment. Our efforts to develop and fully test a more powerful treatment that can address these issues began with a Stage 1 study that: 1) led to the development of a flexible manual that allows treatment tailoring to the unique family characteristics, 2) showed highly promising feasibility and acceptability indicators (Santisteban and Mena, in press) and 3) showed highly promising preliminary outcomes on both drug use and family-level hypothesized mediators (Santisteban et al., unpublished manuscript). This application proposes a Stage II randomized trial with 220 Hispanic youngsters' ages 14-17 meeting criteria for drug abuse and their families. The study will test the treatment's efficacy compared to a control condition, in impacting drug use, risky sexual behavior, and hypothesized mechanisms (family functioning and therapeutic alliance) of change, in a larger and more rigorous trial. The study also includes a test of the dose-response relationship and exploration of moderators of treatment outcome. This application responds to a Program Announcement (PA-07-111) that outlines as areas of interest  ...women, minorities, families, couples, specific cultural groups, adolescents...  The Stage II trial focuses on a treatment designed to boost the treatment effects by building in a flexible tailoring process to better address the specific needs of: 1) adolescents, 2) minorities and a special cultural group - Hispanics, via a treatment that works with 3) couples and families.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Should this line of research continue to be successful, it will contribute to the field: 1) a highly innovative and effective treatment for Hispanic drug abusing adolescents, 2) a better understanding of the mechanisms of change in family therapy with drug abusing adolescents, and 3) a framework for flexible and tailored treatment that can be used to better address the unique needs of other special populations.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manganese (Mn) is both an essential nutrient and a toxic redox metal.  Hence its in vivo  concentration has to be carefully maintained.  Yet, little is known about how ionic Mn (i-Mn) is acquired,  handled, and stored.  In several unicellular organisms, i-Mn has been shown to compensate for the lack  of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase.  In the simple multi-cellular organism, Caenorhabditis  elegans, we have observed that i-Mn supplementation increased resistance to reactive oxygen species  (ROS) and extended lifespan.  It is unclear how i-Mn exerts this antioxidant-like activity.  Our working  hypothesis is that i-Mn exerts this beneficial activity primarily through the activation of the Fork head- related transcription factor, DAF-16, which regulates the expression of several genes that confer  resistance to ROS in C. elegans.  Additionally, we postulate that when DAF-16 pathway is disrupted, i- Mn binds to suitable ligands in vivo to form a small molecule with ROS neutralizing ability, which can  act as a backup defense system.   We will use proteomics to identify what proteins are differentially  expressed with i-Mn treatment and carry out phenotypic analysis using daf-16 mutant to test the  importance of this transcription factor for the observed i-Mn function.  We will also carry out a  functional genomics screen to identify genes required for the protective antioxidant-like function of i- Mn.  Additionally, we will fractionate worms to examine if, non-protein, Mn-containing low molecular  weight species form in vivo, and test if this fraction or the isolated species provide protection against ROS  in C. elegans.  The proposed studies will provide mechanistic details for the antioxidant-like activity of i- Mn.  These studies will also pinpoint key targets of i-Mn along with identifying proteins involved in Mn  acquisition, trafficking and storage.  Detailed picture of Mn metabolism is likely to emerge.  In addition,  the proposed studies will provide outstanding training to several undergraduates and master's level  students at California State University, Fullerton, and better prepare them for future careers in  Biomedical Sciences.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Free radical mediated damage is associated with over two hundred human diseases and aging.   The proposed project utilizes a simple, living, multi-cellular eukaryote, which is comparable to humans,  to investigate how a potential free radical scavenger, manganese, works inside a cell.  Learning how manganese gets into the cells to exert its beneficial antioxidant-like function is relevant to human health,  as it can lead to novel drugs or supplements that could potentially slow the aging process and improve  quality of life.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that coordinated surface behavior, such as swarming motility and biofilm formation, is crucial for competitive success in diverse environments. We propose to examine the details of these complex surface behaviors in a model system, Variovorax paradoxus. Based on previous work in our lab, we have demonstrated the presence of a wetting agent that is produced during swarming. We will identify this wetting agent and the genes involved in producing the material. Based on previous work on V. paradoxus biofilms, we have identified a type IV pilus locus as well as numerous genes involved in lipopolysaccharide and exopolysaccharides that influence swarming and biofilm phenotypes. We will further examine the roles of the pilY1 gene, which has been implicated in several aspects of surface behavior, and which may be present in several isoforms. Our preliminary data shows that independent insertion mutants in this gene can have divergent phenotypes, consistent with the hypothesis that two protein isoforms are playing different roles in these behaviors. The genes of the LPS/eps synthesis loci will be investigated and their roles synthesis of surface and secreted polysaccharides will be determined using genetic and biochemical tools. We will examine the culture conditions that control the decision between these surface behaviors, and identify mutants that are defective in swarming motility, focusing on the signal transduction pathways that trigger the response. These experiments will allow us to build a model of V. paradoxus surface behaviors that includes the structural components critical to motility and sessile development, as well as the signal transduction pathways and biochemical circuits that control this decision.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Bacterial success in many environments is dependent on coordinated surface behaviors, including motility and sessile development as a biofilm. In this study, we examine the surface behaviors and associated structures -- such as wetting agents, pili, flagella, and exopolysaccharides-- of the soil bacterium Variovorax paradoxus, the genes involved in these behaviors and their regulation by environmental cues. These studies will result in a comprehensive model of these surface behaviors, which are crucial to bacterial survival in many environments, with particular relevance to opportunistic infections and virulence.',\n",
       " 'Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is a major cause of vision loss worldwide. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective vaccine against ocular herpes. We have discovered that some human HSV-1 glycoprotein B and D (gB and gD) epitopes were strongly recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic patients but not from symptomatic patients, while other gB and gD epitopes were strongly recognized by T-cells from symptomatic but not from asymptomatic patients (P<0.005). We obtained proof-of-principle that intranasal immunization of double transgenic mice expressing both class 1 and class 2 Human Leukocyte Antigens (i.e. HLA-DR and HLA-A2.1) with  asymptomatic CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes  linked to lipid moiety (lipopeptides), but not with  symptomatic CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes , induced strong local HSV-specific T cells and provided protection against ocular challenge with HSV-1. Herpes tegument proteins VP11/12 and VP13/14 are also major targets for effector T cells. Our Specific Aim for year 1 is: Test the hypothesis that, although most HSV-1 epitopes are recognized by both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, there are human gB, gD, VP11/12, and VP13/14 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are recognized only by asymptomatic patients or only by symptomatic patients. The identification and characterization of the spectrum of HSV-1 T cell epitopes recognized by asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is a novel approach that should break new ground in our understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying ocular herpes disease and may ultimately lead to an effective vaccine. This research is in accordance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) program. The proposal requests one-year funding support of the previously funded parent RO1 grant NEI 14900  Ocular Mucosal Immunity Induced by HSV-1 Lipopeptides .',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs is presently the most commonly used weapon in the treatment of advanced cancer. However, the therapeutic efficacy of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is limited by factors such as tumor heterogeneity, host toxicity and drug resistance. Recent advances in drug development have provided new opportunities to improve cancer therapy using drugs that target the tumor vasculature and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. To date, however, the survival benefit of these angiogenesis inhibitors has been rather modest and efforts to improve activity by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have been only partially successful. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel, more effective approaches to combining angiogenesis inhibitors with traditional cancer chemotherapeutics, building on progress made in the last project period in studies using the VEGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib and the liver cytochrome P450-activated anti-cancer prodrug cyclophosphamide. The major aims of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the mechanism whereby anti-angiogenic drug treatment blocks tumor regression induced by metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment and then devise alternative therapeutic approaches that circumvent this block; 2) to investigate the use of provascular strategies to enhance tumor delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs given in conjunction with anti-angiogenesis; 3) to harness the anti-vascular effects of anti-angiogenic drugs so as to increase tumor cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs administered intratumorally via an intratumoral 'trapping' (enhanced drug retention) mechanism; and 4) to investigate the impact of changes in tumor microvessel density, neovascularization and vascular maturity on responsiveness to the combination of anti-angiogenic drug treatment with chemotherapy. Together, these studies will elucidate ways to increase responsiveness to anti-angiogenic drugs by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in a way that improves overall therapeutic activity, and will thereby advance the development of anti-cancer therapies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates ways to increase responsiveness to anti-angiogenic drugs by combination with conventional cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These studies may identify strategies that can be used to improve the therapeutic effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs in the clinic, and thereby advance the development of anti-cancer therapies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery results in neurological problems. Inflammatory cytokines in the plaque induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thus thinning the fibrous cap and resulting in plaque destabilization and rupture. During the initial funding cycle, we made novel observations that IGF-1 is more potent in inducing the survival of VSMCs in carotid endarterectomy tissues of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. Also, atheroma-associated cytokines decrease IGF-1-induced survival and proliferation of VSMCs. In our follow-up studies we observed specific differences in the profile of dendritic cells (DCs), T-regulatory cells, and NPY and NPY receptors in symptomatic (unstable) and asymptomatic (stable) plaques. Also, stronger immunoreactivity of Foxp3, IL-10 and CD25 with preponderance of CD4? T cells in carotid plaques of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. IGF-1 increased mRNA transcripts of NPY-Y2 and NPY-Y5 receptors in asymptomatic but not in symptomatic plaque SMCs. These novel findings suggest a cell-mediated immune response in carotid plaques which is regulated by NPY. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammation in the carotid plaque is modulated by interaction of NPY with DCs and T cells leading to increased inflammation and apoptosis of VSMCs in carotid plaques of symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis, and that atheroma-associated cytokines modulate NPY receptors and their function in VSMCs of carotid plaques. In Aim 1, we will examine the phenotypes of dendritic cells and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules in DCs in the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. In Aim 2, we will examine the phenotype of T-regulatory cells (inducible CD4? T-regs and naturally-occurring CD4???? T-regs) and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of the receptors for co-stimulatory molecules (PD-1, CTLA- 4) in T-regs from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. We will also determine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of atheroma-associated cytokines, on the differentiation of naive T cells into T-regulatory cells. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of inflammatory cytokines, on the survival and apoptosis of VSMCs isolated from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the instability and rupture of carotid plaques in patients with carotid stenosis. Such investigations would provide unique insights to the pathophysiologic process of neurological diseases associated with the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and the means to prevent the disease in patients with carotid stenosis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV-1 surface glycoprotein Env (gp120/gp41) mediates viral entry through a series of coordinated structural changes initiated when CD4 interacts with gp120. Ultimately, the gp41 ectodomain folds into a compact trimer-of-hairpins that brings the viral and cellular membranes into the close proximity required for efficient membrane fusion. These conformational transitions have been delineated, in part, through the use of C- peptide and 5-Helix inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions of gp41 and block trimer-of-hairpins formation. Our previous work has described the physical basis behind C-peptide and 5-Helix inhibition and quantitatively modeled the relationship between inhibitory potency and fusion kinetics. The experiments outlined in this application explore the structure and dynamics of Env in its native and intermediate conformations. The research will address three fundamental questions regarding the mechanism of viral membrane fusion: How does CD4 binding to gp120 trigger formation of the prehairpin intermediate state? What is the structure of Env in this intermediate conformation? What aspects of gp41 folding from the prehairpin state drive the fusion of viral and cellular membranes? Owing to the unstable nature of Env in its native and intermediate states, these questions are often difficult to address using standard experimental techniques, such as scanning mutagenesis, that require stable proteins in long lived conformations. Our basic approach will be to generate new inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions, and dissect the mechanism of resistance to them. This strategy takes advantage of the power of natural selection to generate well-behaved mutant Env variants with interesting structural or dynamic properties. The specific aims are: 1) to explore the structure and exposure of the HR1 region using novel inhibitors engineered to overcome standard C-peptide resistance profiles; 2) to probe the structure and exposure of the HR2 region using multivalent inhibitors, and to dissect the mechanisms of resistance to these agents; and 3) to explore the energetic requirements of Env- mediated membrane fusion, and to examine the structure of mutant Env variants trapped in intermediate conformations. Our findings will provide new insights into the dynamic properties of the gp120/gp41 complex critical to the viral entry mechanism and will aide the development of new viral entry inhibitors and HIV-1 vaccines.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long term objective of the proposed research is to increase our knowledge about the structure, function and inhibition of the HIV-1 Env, the major protein on the viral surface. These experiments involve inhibitor design and characterization in order to explore how Env promotes HIV-1 entry through viral membrane fusion. Analyzing of the mechanisms of viral escape from these inhibitors will provide insights into the energetics and kinetics of Env structural changes that promote membrane fusion. The research will ultimately facilitate therapeutic and vaccine development for the treatment and prevention of AIDS.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diverticular disease is one of the most prevalent disorders in western societies, and complications of diverticulosis are frequent, costly and often recurrent. Identification of individuals at high risk for these complications is of great clinical importance. However, few risk factors have been identified, and no preventative strategies exist short of segmental colectomy. The role of human intestinal microbiota in disease is increasingly being recognized. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology now enable cost-effective, large-scale profiling of the intestinal microbiota, and provide a new quantitative tool for the study of gastrointestinal disorders. The intestinal microbiota represent an attractive target for study in diverticular disease since they can be sampled, providing the basis for a potential biomarkers and preventative interventions. The overall goal of this proposal is to profile the intestinal microbiota in both patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and those with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. We plan to use a combination of state-of-the-art molecular and novel metagenomic approaches, and to determine whether quantitative analysis of the intestinal microbiome can be used to differentiate diverticular disease phenotypes. Uncovering such differences would be of great potential clinical significance, since they could be modeled to (i) enable outcome prediction and risk stratification; (ii) provide avenues for treatment and prevention, and (iii) reveal insight into pathogenesis. In pursuit of this goal, we plan to profile the intestinal microbiome in diverticular disease using two parallel study cohorts: (i) 100 patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis recruited prospectively from the outpatient endoscopy units of two large teaching hospitals; and (ii) 100 prospectively identified patients with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. Replicate fecal DNA samples will be collected longitudinally from each study individual using well-tested methods. We will then perform intestinal microbiome profiling using a combination of metagenomic Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (tRFLP) analysis and a novel digital 16S fingerprinting approach utilizing next-generation sequencing. These data will yield deep, high-resolution fingerprints of the intestinal microbial metagenome in each disease population, which can then be compared to identify composite biomarkers that predict disease complications.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use innovative molecular techniques to profile the intestinal microbiota in both patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and those with diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis. The identification of a unique microbial metagenomic fingerprint in patients with diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis could provide the basis for a non-invasive screening tool for at-risk individuals, and/or for directed preventative interventions. This study has important public health implications since diverticulosis is extremely common and there is currently no way to identify patients at risk for complications and preventative strategies are limited.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) leads to cerebrovascular deposition of ss-amyloid resulting in vessel fragility and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The high prevalence of white matter disease in CAA is possibly secondary to vessel dysfunction and vascular insufficiency. In the context of an ongoing NIH-funded prospective cohort study, this project aims to test the hypotheses that both the degree and location of white matter disease in CAA is an independent contributor to neurologic and functional impairment. The applicant is a junior faculty member in the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. It is the applicant's career goal to obtain expertise in the clinical and radiologic investigation of vascular diseases of white matter. He plans to obtain the necessary didactic training specific to this proposal during the grant period using an extensive multidisciplinary institutional network. He will not only take advantage of the Mentor's K24-funded training program in patient-oriented research (5K24NS056207-02), but will have an individualized training program tailored to his specific research interests. Through the rigorous research and educational training associated with this award the applicant seeks to become an independent clinician-investigator in the field of cerebral small vessel disease. The applicant's primary mentor, Dr. Steven Greenberg, is currently Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and Co-Director of the MGH Neurology Clinical Trials Unit. He is an internationally recognized leader in intracerebral hemorrhage and CAA with numerous prominent publications in the field. Dr. Greenberg has developed a very strong research program involving numerous multidisciplinary subspecialties. Dr. A. Gregory Sorensen, the Associate Director of the Martinos Center for Bioimaging will be applicant's co-mentor for this proposal. As one of the leaders in field of MRI research, Dr. Sorensen is strongly committed to aiding the applicant in the elements of study design and data analysis pertaining to radiological imaging. The applicant is attached to both the MGH Stroke Service and the MGH Memory Disorders Unit (MDU). The MGH Stroke Service is a nationally recognized referral center for patients with acute or chronic cerebrovascular diseases with state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities. The service will provide an exposure to the entire spectrum of cerebrovascular disease, including the approximately 120 cases per year of intracerebral hemorrhage, the focus of the applicant's study. The Memory Disorders Unit was first established in 1982 and is an integral part of the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) which has an ongoing NIH-funded clinical research study enrolling patients affected with all types of memory disorders, including vascular dementia and CAA. It was established by Dr. John Growdon and currently led by Dr. Bradley Hyman, two highly-renowned investigators. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: (1) extent of white matter disease (as measured by WMH volume and mean DTI measures) in CAA is associated with gait and balance dysfunction, cognitive impairment and disability, (2) the anatomic location of white matter disease (measured in regions of interest (ROIs) and voxel- based analysis) correlates with these outcome measures and (3) the progression of white matter disease (measured by increase in WMH volume and mean DTI measures in longitudinal follow-up) in CAA results in a measurable increase in these neurological deficits. Degree of gait and balance impairment will be assessed using established qualitative and quantitative measures. The extent of white matter disease on T2-weighted MRI sequences will be evaluated using validated volumetric methods. The location of white matter disease will be assessed using voxel-based analysis of high-resolution MRI sequences. Repeat MRIs at 16 and 36 months will be similarly evaluated to assess degree white matter disease progression and its impact on the measured outcomes. As the pathology of advanced CAA represents a relatively homogenous microvascular process, it serves an ideal model of cerebral vessel dysfunction. The data resulting from the proposed study would have significant implications for not only those patients with CAA-related intracerebral hemorrhage, but the broader elderly population with clinically  silent  CAA. Unlike other common small vessel diseases such as arteriolosclerosis, CAA remains difficult to diagnose early in its course. The results from this study could potentially help identify those patients with  asymptomatic  CAA prior to ICH or cognitive impairment, thus being of paramount importance for future trials aimed at preventing the devastating effects of this disease.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall research aim of this Center of Excellence in Malaria Research is to organize a comprehensive approach to understanding the biological features of Amazonian malaria towards the ultimate goal of regional control and elimination of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. We focus primarily on P. vivax due to its greater impact in the region. We anticipate that the lessons learned will contribute towards the audacious goal of global malaria eradication. An integrated and interactive set of 5 projects will be supported by Administrative, Data Management and Shared Laboratory Resource Cores to study malaria epidemiology, vector biology and ecology, diagnostics, transmission biology and clinical pathogenesis towards the goal of malaria control, regional elimination and eradication in the Amazon region of South America. Three epidemiological distinct sites primarily affected by P. vivax (~80% of cases) but also by P. falciparum (~20%) of cases will be studied: Acre, Brazil; Iquitos, Peru; and Madre de Dio/Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Investigators from University of Sao Paulo and the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru will be the lead foreign collaborators, and will join forces with lead institution University of California San Diego, and collaborating institutions Wadsworth Center of the New York Health Department, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center Detachment, Lima, Peru to carry out the aims of the Center.     RELEVANCE: The Peru/Brazil Center of Excellence in Malaria Research will take an integrated approach to the study of malaria epidemiology, vector biology and ecology, diagnostics, transmission biology and clinical pathogenesis to underpin malaria control, elimination and eradication efforts in the Amazon region of South America.     PROJECT 1:  Title: Epidemiology of Malaria in the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon  Project Leader: Ferreira, M.    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Institutions based in two malaria-endemic countries, Brazil and Peru, are partnering with a leading research group in the USA with the long-term goal of providing scientific evidence that can be translated into effective public health interventions for malaria control in Amazonia. To determine whether asymptomatic parasite carriage is a major contributor to malaria transmission across the region, we aim: (a) to estimate the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for asymptomatic malaria parasite carriage in rural Amazonia; (b) to estimate the prevalence, incidence, average duration and risk factors for gametocyte carriage; (c) to compare the ability of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of gametocytes to experimentally infect wild-caught local vectors; (d) to compare prospectively the risk of subsequent clinical malaria among asymptomatic parasite carriers and non-infected controls living in the same communities and to determine whether these episodes are due to persistent parasite lineages or to new infections; and (e) to test whether intra-host competition of genetically distinct parasite clones contributes to increased parasite virulence, greater risk of disease, and increased gametocyte production. These aims will be achieved with population-based surveys, using uniformized clinical and laboratory protocols, in three epidemiologically diverse Amazonian settings: (a) a typical agricultural settlement with endemic malaria transmission in Brazil, (b) periurban villages in Peru that became recently exposed to epidemic malaria, and (c) gold-mining enclaves in Peru with explosive malaria outbreaks due to P. vivax. The field-based clinical and epidemiological analysis will be complemented with measurements of immunological parameters, extensive parasite genotyping and experimental infections of mosquitoes through membrane-feeding assays, providing a unique multidisciplinary perspective on the public health significance of asymptomatic parasite carriage in the Amazon Basin. Of crucial importance, the infrastructure and the data resulting from seven years of active malaria surveillance in the field sites will establish the bases for the vector biology and pathogenesis components of this proposal and for implementing future malaria vaccine trials in the Amazon region.     RELEVANCE: At a time when eradication is advocated as the ultimate goal of malaria control strategies worldwide, it remains unclear why malaria proved so difficult to control in areas of relatively low levels of transmission across the Amazon Basin. We hypothesize that asymptomatic infections may represent a major reservoir of parasites in this region, which is not addressed by traditional malaria control strategies.',\n",

The ICEMR research activities have been divided into three closely inter-related projects as follows: Project 1 on Epidemiology will determine the ecological and epidemiological features in non-Amazonian regions; Project 2 on malaria transmission will address major gaps in our understanding of the ecology, behavior, vector potential, and control of Anopheles malaria vectors to guide the development and implementation of more effective integrated Vector Management (IVM) strategies, and Project 3 on malaria pathogenesis, that it will determine the clinical outcome of malaria infections and its correlation with the immunological status in communities living under different intensifies of malaria transmission in the study region. CLAIM would involve its epidemiology team to closely work with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) of all partner countries, to locate and track the  hot spots  and to assess the changing epidemiological conditions, identifying the malaria patterns and establishing linkages with environmental and anthropogenic factors or other determinants of malaria transmission. The study team will provide technical assistance for helping NMCPs improve surveillance operations, including quality control and assurance of data with respect to diagnostics. This ICEMR proposal includes training activities for selected junior scientists and groups of researchers/technicians. Special projects will be initiated by Year 3 of the program and will profit to redirect the program and/or involve other countries. A Data Management (DM) Core will coordinate all research protocol, DM, data analyses and publications. All CLAIM activities will be coordinated by Core A under responsibility of Caucaseco SRC. CLAIM will combine the multidisciplinary and integrated approach to enhance the research underpinnings for effective malaria elimination and possibly eradication. Data and findings generated by this Center are expected to provide input critical to inform future research design and evaluation of new interventions and control strategies.     RELEVANCE:  This is a comprehensive project designed to establish an international Center of Excellence for Malaria Research in Latin America (CLAIM) composed of multiple public and private research centers from the endemic countries, the USA and Europe working jointly to find alternatives for malaria control. Results will facilitate malaria elimination in low malaria endemic settings.       PROJECT 1:  Title:  Epidemiology of Malaria Transmission in Low to Moderate Settings of Latin America  Project Leader: Herrera, S.    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main objective of Project 1 is to evaluate the diversity of the ecology and parasite populations related to the epidemiology and clinical findings in order to establish a scientific framework that supports the development of new intervention strategies for malaria elimination in non-Amazonian areas of LA. This goal will be approached through the following specific aims: 1) Study the epidemiology of seasonal malaria and their relationship with parasite population diversity and 2) Identification of risk factors associated with malaria transmission in non-Amazonian areas of LA countries.     We hypothesize that circulating Plasmodium populations and their dynamics modulate the clinical manifestations and immune responses in the affected populations and that vector bionomics, parasite population diversity, host biology and behavior, household conditions, and local environmental conditions, act simultaneously to determine malaria transmission and risk of infection. The studies proposed for aim 1 are directed to determine the real prevalence and incidence of malaria by considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals living in seasonal areas in LA.     This investigation includes community based cohort studies (prospective studies), active surveillance using temporal cross-sectional studies, and hospital based passive surveillance studies. The studies will be carried out in 7 endemic areas of Colombia, Peru, Panama and Guatemala, where a total of 21 sentinel sites will be studied. Studies will be carried out in three phases: 1) Our own census of the selected population from sentinel sites where inhabitants will be registered using a demographic questionnaire and houses coordinates using a GPS system; 2) thick smear and PCR for malaria diagnose in selected sentinels sites and random sampling in order to determine asymptomatic gametocytes carriers; 3) clinical follow-up and thick smear of asymptomatic at two sentinel sites (one in Colombia (Tierralta) and one in Peru (Sulluna). For aim 2 we will a) assess the conditions of antimalarial use in communities where malaria is endemic, including adherence, self-medication and prophylaxis; and (b) study the conditions of use of antimalarials in the public and private health institutions including the availability and suitability to care guides. In this ICEMR program, we will establish a network of sentinel sites that will be selected integrating bio-geographic criteria (vector and ecological conditions) and epidemiological information. Sentinel sites will provide baseline information on malaria ecology and epidemiology with the goal of characterizing parasite and vector populations resilient to control interventions. Such network will allow supporting current efforts directed to develop population models to quantify disease dynamics and malaria risk-maps to support MOH elimination activities.     RELEVANCE: Identify the relationship between environmental factors, parasite characteristics, household conditions and the malaria prevalence related to the epidemiology and clinical findings.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to improve health care for children with urological problems through research on effectiveness and health care delivery. As a pediatric urologist with a focus in health services research, I seek this Career Development Award so that I can establish an independent research career in a field where such research has not yet reached its full potential. Pediatric urology is a subspecialty in transition, moving from a field based primarily on personal surgical experience and case series, to one based on comprehensive longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials. I seek to contribute to this transition process.  In this application, I propose to investigate the clinical dilemma posed by siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureter and kidney, and is associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal injury. VUR is both common and familial, and asymptomatic siblings of children with VUR having high rates of VUR themselves. However, it is not known if screening of such siblings is beneficial. The natural history of unscreened siblings is also unknown. I plan to conduct a research study of sibling VUR, and leverage this research in three ways. First, the findings of the study will make a clinically useful contribution to our understanding of this controversial clinical condition. Second, I intend to use this research as the vehicle for a systematic expansion of my working knowledge of decision analysis as it applies to medical decision-making. Third, this research, and my educational development, will serve as a foundation for follow-up studies as I seek independent research funding in the future.  My short term goals include the following: (1) To further develop my knowledge of techniques and methodologies for observational clinical studies, analysis of large administrative databases, and advanced statistical modeling techniques, (2) To learn and apply the techniques of decision analysis, to support guidelines for clinical decision-making regarding SCVUR, and to direct future directions for empiric studies of SCVUR; (3) To use health care claims data from a defined population to conduct a retrospective cohort study in order to (a) determine important clinical outcomes among SCVUR, both screened and unscreened, and (b) to determine practice patterns regarding SCVUR within the studied population; and (4) To lay the foundation for further clinical studies of SCVUR, and support applications for independent funding for this research.  The research project will consist of a retrospective cohort study of siblings of children with VUR. These children will be identified via analysis of claims data within a large regional health insurance company. I will seek to characterize patterns of care for such siblings, and document specific clinical outcomes. Then, these findings will be applied to a decision analysis to determine whether screening of asymptomatic siblings for VUR is appropriate. The research aims are complementary. The clinical study will determine critical clinical outcomes, such as the incidence of UTI among unscreened siblings. These data are simply not available in the current literature. These results, in turn, will facilitate the development of decision analysis models. Currently, such models are severely limited by the lack of data regarding outcomes among VUR siblings. More sophisticated models, incorporating the findings from this analysis, would be of great value as tools to help define the optimal management approach for sibling VUR.  In addition to the research component of the proposal, I will obtain formal training in advanced clinical research techniques, decision analysis, and biostatistics. This coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health will extend my knowledge of research techniques, particularly in decision analysis methodology, beyond those acquired during my prior MPH curriculum.  In these endeavors I will be supported by the extraordinary resources of Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School. I will be guided by my superior advisory team, led by my primary mentor Mark Schuster, MD, PhD, a highly accomplished pediatric health services researcher.  In the long term, I anticipate that the activities described in this proposal will support and inform a subsequent application for R01 funding to study familial VUR. I hope to develop the expertise and infrastructure to support an active, multi-pronged clinical and health services research program, conducting simultaneous observational and interventional trials in key areas of pediatric urology, and focusing on common conditions affecting large numbers of children.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research project seeks learn more about the best way to manage vesicoureteral reflux (backwards flow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys) among siblings of children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR is quite common, and runs in families, so there are large numbers of siblings who might have VUR based on their family history. Although some people advocate testing these siblings for VUR even if they seem healthy, such  screening  would subject large numbers of asymptomatic children to invasive tests with potentially adverse effects, long-term follow-up, prolonged antibiotic use, and possible surgery. Therefore, it is important that we learn more about VUR in these siblings in order to decide whether such screening makes sense.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is more common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) than in the general population. Clinical manifestations of PHPT are more severe in vitamin D deficient patients, and even in those with mild disease, patients with low vitamin D levels have higher PTH concentrations and bone turnover markers. Given the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the PHPT population, it is likely that our current understanding of the biochemical and skeletal features of PHPT reflects an admixture of these two conditions. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that in patients with PHPT: 1) Vitamin D deficiency worsens the hyperparathyroid state and is associated with its own specific skeletal features; and 2) Repletion of vitamin D will ameliorate those aspects of the disease that are due to vitamin D deficiency, and thus reveal the true biochemical and skeletal phenotype of the underlying disease. To test these hypotheses, this proposal will utilize state-of-the-art biochemical and skeletal imaging methods. The proposal has the following aims: 1. To compare PHPT patients with and without vitamin D deficiency in order to: a) determine the skeletal features of the hyperparathyroid state that are attributable to vitamin D deficiency; and b) to describe the skeleton in PHPT without the confounding effects of co- existing vitamin D deficiency. 2. To investigate the early effects of high dose vitamin D repletion on histomorphometric parameters of bone remodeling (by quadruple labeled bone biopsy). 3. To investigate the effects of three vitamin D repletion regimens on biochemical, denstometric, microarchitectural and biomechanical features of PHPT. This proposal will fulfill a key mandate of the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism (2008) to obtain more data on vitamin D deficiency in individuals with PHPT. The recently published International Consensus Guidelines on Asymptomatic PHPT (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94:335-9, 2009) specifically call for measurement of 25- hydroxyvitamin D in all patients with PHPT, and repletion of low levels (<20 ng/ml). However, no recommendations for repletion were included in the Guidelines, because of limited data upon which to base them. This information is urgently needed, as are data on the effects of vitamin D treatment in PHPT upon clinically relevant endpoints such as bone density, skeletal microarchitecture, bone remodeling and bone strength. This proposal will therefore enhance our understanding of the skeleton in PHPT, while providing information that may help in formulating recommendations for vitamin D repletion, a key research goal of the new Consensus Guidelines, and an imperative for clinicians treating this disorder. The ultimate benefit will be to patients with PHPT, for whom clinical decision-making will be strengthened by data that have heretofore not been available.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, frequently presents with co-existing vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency not only heightens the severity of the parathyroid disease, but may also increase the risk of non-skeletal health problems. This proposal will provide data on vitamin D deficiency in primary hyperparathyroidism, first by comparing patients with and without co-existing vitamin D deficiency; and then by examining the effects of vitamin D repletion. The studies will therefore enhance our understanding of the skeleton in primary hyperparathyroidism, while providing information that may help in formulating recommendations for vitamin D repletion, a key research goal of the 2008 International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism, and an imperative for clinicians treating this common disorder.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal application is designed to obtain extended follow-up of a unique cohort of asymptomatic patients with rotator cuff tears from which substantial and encouraging data has been obtained. The broad aim of this proposed research is to determine the natural history of rotator cuff disease and factors important in the clinical deterioration of tears. This information is fundamental for determining proper surgical indications and optimizing outcome. These patients offer a rare opportunity to determine risk factors for tear degeneration over time as treatment intervention has not been necessitated by the onset of symptoms. Additionally, we aim to establish two new follow-up cohorts which should provide important adjunctive information regarding partial-thickness tear progression and the relationship between the development of fatty degeneration with tear size, tear location and the development of new pain. Our specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To obtain long-term follow-up of full-thickness tears to evaluate factors important for tear deterioration and symptom development. A population of 89 individuals identified as having unilateral asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have been followed for minimum period of 2 yrs. Important information regarding alteration in glenohumeral kinematics, rate of tear enlargement, changes in muscle strength and fatty degeneration are anticipated with longer-term follow-up. These patients will be followed with yearly radiographic, outcome, ultrasound and clinical exams for up to 10 yrs. Specific Aim 2: To determine the probability of partial tear progression to full-thickness tears. For 48 individuals previously enrolled with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears and 50 new recruitment patients, yearly high resolution ultrasound exams will be performed to determine the risk of complete tear degeneration. Specific Aim 3: To longitudinally follow full-thickness tears to determine factors important to the development of fatty degeneration. Fatty degeneration of rotator cuff muscles is an irreversible phenomenon associated with decreased healing and outcome following surgical treatment. Ultrasound will be employed to assess what factors such as tear location, tear size, and patient age may be important in the development of fatty degeneration. To date, data from the enrolled population of patients with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have provided a wealth of new information regarding the natural history of cuff disease and important factors for surgical indications. The proposed project could be an important next step in understanding the natural history of cuff disease and innovative in that a unique study population of asymptomatic tears and partial tears will be longitudinally followed during an extended time of symptom development and tear deterioration with fatty degeneration. With the proposed study design, risk factors for irreversible tendon or muscle deterioration will be studied. This knowledge is important to determine the necessity for early operative treatment.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A painful shoulder from rotator cuff disease is one of the most common problems afflicting the musculoskeletal system with research showing that up to 50% of individuals over the age of 70yo may have tears. Understanding what factors are important in the development of pain, loss of strength, and enlargement of the tear is critically important to formulate strategies for treatment. This study proposes to follow individuals with rotator cuff tears and no pain over an extended period of time to determine the risk of new pain and deterioration of the cuff.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a major obstacle to cancer treatment. Therapy-induced overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux pumps promotes resistance in many drug-treated cancers. While early studies focused on overexpression and activity of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) pump, a structurally distinct group of ABC efflux pumps, known as the Multidrug Resistance Proteins (MRPs), have been gaining increasing attention as alternative sources of resistance. We have recently shown that MRP7 is distinct from other MRPs in conferring resistance to a wide variety of anticancer agents including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, epothilone B and nucleoside-based agents. However, little is known about the in vivo role of MRP7. In preliminary studies, we generated an Mrp7-/- knockout model, and established that these mice are sensitized to treatment with paclitaxel even though they are wild type for Pgp, thought to be the major taxane efflux pump. In a recent collaborative study we showed that in cultured cells, MRP7 activity is inhibited by lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of the ErbB1/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase receptors that is becoming a common agent in clinical management of breast cancer. Based on these data, we hypothesize Mrp7 expression and activity might be a hitherto unappreciated modulators of breast cancer resistance to drug treatment. To test this idea, we have developed two breast cancer models. First, we have crossed Mrp7-/- knockout mice to the MMTV- Polyoma Virus middle T antigen (PyVMT) mammary tumor model, derived cell lines from the mammary tumors, and begun analysis of drug resistance. We have also begun crossing Mrp7-/- knockout mice to the well- established MMTV-ErbB2/HER2/neu mouse model, considered the most physiological for human breast cancer, and will also derive cell lines from mammary tumors from this model. We propose two Aims to investigate the in vivo role of Mrp7, as well to determine the mechanism of MRP7-dependent chemoresistance in cancer cells. The proposed aims this proposal will address are: 1) To assess MRP7 as a resistance factor in breast cancer and 2) determine if lapatinib inhibits Mrp7 in vivo activity and further define the nature of this inhibition. Our ultimate goals are to determine if MRP7 expression can be used as a biomarker for treatment specifically, and if the knowledge of MRP7 status can be used to develop improved treatment strategies for breast cancer.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of MRP7 as an in vivo chemoresistance factor for breast cancer would be completely novel and is relevant to public health. Our preliminary data indicate both intrinsic and drug-selected variance in levels of MRP7 expression, suggesting analysis and targeting of MRP7 has considerable potential to improve treatment of human breast cancer and this is directly relevant to NCI's mission of bringing novel therapies to cancer patients.\",\n",
       " 'Institutions based in two malaria-endemic countries, Brazil and Peru, are partnering with a leading research group in the USA with the long-term goal of providing scientific evidence that can be translated into effective public health interventions for malaria control in Amazonia. To determine whether asymptomatic parasite carriage is a major contributor to malaria transmission across the region, we aim: (a) to estimate the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for asymptomatic malaria parasite carriage in rural Amazonia; (b) to estimate the prevalence, incidence, average duration and risk factors for gametocyte carriage; (c) to compare the ability of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of gametocytes to experimentally infect wild caught local vectors; (d) to compare prospectively the risk of subsequent clinical malaria among asymptomatic parasite carriers and non-infected controls living in the same communities and to determine whether these episodes are due to persistent parasite lineages or to new infections; and (e) to test whether intra-host competition of genetically distinct parasite clones contributes to increased parasite virulence, greater risk of disease, and increased gametocyte production. These aims will be achieved with population based surveys, using uniformized clinical and laboratory protocols, in three epidemiologically diverse Amazonian settings: (a) a typical agricultural settlement with endemic malaria transmission in Brazil, (b) periurban villages in Peru that became recently exposed to epidemic malaria, and (c) gold-mining enclaves in Peru with explosive malaria outbreaks due to P. vivax. The field-based clinical and epidemiological analysis will be complemented with measurements of immunological parameters, extensive parasite genotyping and experimental infections of mosquitoes through membrane-feeding assays, providing a unique multidisciplinary perspective on the public health significance of asymptomatic parasite carriage in the Amazon Basin. Of crucial importance, the infrastructure and the data resulting of seven years of active malaria surveillance in the field sites will establish the bases for the vector biology and pathogenesis components ofthis proposal and for implementing future malaria vaccine trials in the Amazon region.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing prevalence of obesity in youth has become a public health crisis, especially for minority adolescents. Behaviors that have been shown to be effective in reducing obesity (i.e., sedentary behavior (SB), physical activity (PA), diet) in youth are influenced by their parents and peer interactions. Preliminary focus groups conducted by the fellowship candidate suggest that because African American caregivers are engaging in many positive parenting behaviors such as monitoring, expanding these practices to specifically target their adolescent's health behaviors is promising. Previous studies also indicate that parents may play a role in shaping health behaviors by monitoring their own child's behavior in addition to their child's peer relationships. Furthermore, the balance between setting limits and autonomy around health behaviors may be based on a set of interactions in which adolescents and parents collaborate in the decision-making process. While interventions that have sought to improve PA and diet in African American families, few have included parent components around rules and monitoring in adolescents. Furthermore, few have targeted parental management of peer interactions around these behaviors. The purpose of this project is to test the feasibility of a novel 8-week interactive parent intervention that targets parent variables (i.e., rules, autonomy support, monitoring) to facilitate peer interactions which decrease SB and consumption of unhealthy (i.e., high fat, high sugar) foods and increase PA and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption in African American adolescents. Seventy adolescents and their caregivers will be randomized to either an interactive parent-based intervention (IPB) or a general health education program (GHE). The IPB intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and will target parent variables through 8 weekly sessions designed to teach parents how to further refine their parenting strategies (i.e., rules, autonomy support, monitoring) in order to effectively impact the relationship between peer interactions and adolescent self-efficacy and self-concept specific to SB, PA, and diet. The essential elements of the intervention include: rules, autonomy support, monitoring, peer support, adolescent self-efficacy and self-concept. The GHE program will also include 8 weekly group sessions on general health issues. It is hypothesized that adolescents in the IPB group will demonstrate greater reductions in SB and consumption of high-fat/high sugar foods and greater increases PA and FV consumption compared to those in the GHE group. Similarly, it is hypothesized that caregivers and adolescents will demonstrate greater improvements in parent variables (rules, autonomy support, monitoring) and self-efficacy and self-concept specific to SB, PA, and diet in the IPB intervention compared with caregivers and adolescents in the GHE group at post-intervention, respectively. Finally, this study will explore whether changes in key variables (e.g., peer support, rules, monitoring, and adolescent self-efficacy) may mediate the effect of the intervention on changes in adolescent SB, PA, diet in the IPB group at 8-weeks post-intervention.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health implications of this study are to prevent obesity in African American adolescents and their families by decreasing negative health behaviors (i.e., sedentary behavior, consumption of high-fat/high-sugar foods) and increasing positive health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables) through testing the feasibility of an innovative interactive parent intervention.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the success of highly active anti-retroviral therapy in controlling virus replication in HIV-1 positive individuals, problems such as drug resistance and side effects often compromise the effectiveness of anti-HIV- 1 drug. Therefore, new anti-HIV agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed. In an effort to identify novel anti-HIV-1 agents, we have developed potent betulinic acid (BA) derivatives that inhibit HIV-1 maturation. These compounds are structurally and mechanistically novel when compared to the drugs currently used for AIDS therapy. Their potentials for treatment of AIDS are currently being evaluated under different stages of preclinical or clinical studies. Bevirimat is at the most advanced stage of drug development among the anti- HIV-1 BA derivatives. Although bevirimat is a potent HIV-1 maturation inhibitor, results of phase II clinical trials indicate that it is less effective in a subset (30-40%) of HIV-1 positive individuals. Therefore, bevirimat analogs that can overcome this high baseline drug resistance are expected to have great potential to be developed into anti-HIV-1 drugs. The objective of this study is to synthesize bevirimat analogs that overcome the high baseline drug resistance. We have previously identified the C3 side chain as the anti-HIV-1 maturation pharmacophore of bevirimat. We hypothesize that suitable modifications of the pharmacophore will create a new class of bevirimat analogs that are effective against the drug resistant viruses. We plan to test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this study with the following Specific Aims: (1) to synthesize BA derivatives with optimized pharmacophores. (2) To identify new terpenoid scaffolds and auxiliary groups for the synthesis of new anti-maturation inhibitors against the drug resistant viruses. (3) To determine the drug binding site and mechanism of action of the anti-HIV-1 maturation BA derivatives. Aside from the high baseline drug resistance to bevirimat, results from clinical trials have been promising. The proposed study is expected to overcome this drug resistance and, as a result, will have a high impact on developing a class of novel anti-HIV-1 maturation inhibitors for AIDS therapy.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed study is to develop potent anti-HIV-1 agents that can overcome the drug resistance associated with the HIV-1 maturation inhibitor bevirimat. Aside from the high baseline drug resistance to bevirimat, results of clinical trials have been very successful. The proposed study is expected to overcome this drug resistance and, as a result, will have high impact on developing anti-HIV-1 maturation inhibitors for AIDS therapy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 protease is the target of the most effective anti-viral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. All these drugs derive from successful structure-based design studies. The enzyme cleaves the viral gag-pol polyprotein at least ten unique sites and is essential for maturation of the virion and thus the spread of the virus. Therefore, it has been a prime target for drug design research. Unfortunately the medical efficacy of the current drugs is proving to be short lived, as viable mutant variants of HIV-1 protease confer drug resistance. Drug resistance is a subtle change in the balance of recognition events, between the relative affinity of the enzyme to bind inhibitors and its ability to bind and cleave substrates. Since HIV-1 protease binds substrates and inhibitors at the same active site, a change that alters inhibitor binding also alters substrate binding. We previously developed a structural rationale that explains how HIV protease recognizes its substrates and how drug resistant mutations occur within the active site of HIV protease, while still maintaining substrate recognition. HIV protease recognizes a conserved asymmetric shape that the substrates adopt, the  substrate envelope . This led us to the realization that most active-site drug-resistant mutations within HIV protease occur where the inhibitors protrude beyond the consensus substrate envelope and contact the protease. Those protease residues are prime positions for drug resistance to occur, as they are more important for inhibitor binding than for substrate binding. In this proposal we elucidate the interdependence of drug-induced co-evolution of HIV-1 protease and within Gag and its impact on protease inhibitor drug resistance and investigate how to extend the substrate envelope to other systems.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-1 protease is the target of the most effective anti-viral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately the medical efficacy of the current drugs is proving to be short lived, as viable mutant variants of HIV-1 protease confer drug resistance. Drug resistance is a subtle change in the balance of recognition events, between the relative affinity of HIV protease to its drugs and its ability perform its biological function. In this proposal we investigate this interplay and elucidate the impact on drug resistance to different drugs.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Disease related to CDI ranges from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrheal disease to severe pseudomembranous colifis. Despite the extensive characterizafion of the histologic lesions associated with C. difficile infection, virtually nothing is known mechanistically about the contribution of host factors in disease. It is likely that some of the clinical differences encountered in infected individuals are due to variafion in host response to colonization with C. difficile. We hypothesize that variation in the host innate and adaptive responses for C. difficile are in part responsible for the different clinical phenotypes that are seen in the setting of CDI. Furthermore, we speculate that these variable responses reflect underiying genetic and possibly epigenetic differences in the host. To address these hypotheses we propose the following specific aims: In the first aim we will characterize the innate and adaptive immune response to C. difficile colonization and determine the role of this response in determining the disease manifestations. In the second aim we will identify serum fecal biomarkers and epigenetic changes that correlate distinct clinical outcomes. This aim will examine samples obtained from the Project area #1 for this purpose. The third aim will examine the interaction between host genetics/immune response and C. difficile genotype in the pathogenesis of disease. Mice with defined differences in host response will be challenged with C. difficile strains generated and characterized from the human studies in Project area #1. This will provide an examinafion ofthe relative contribution of host and pathogen factors in disease. These experiments will increase our understanding ofthe host and microbial mechanisms of C. d/Wc/Ve-induced colonic inflammation vs. asymptomatic colonization and identify biomarkers that can be used to improve clinical treatments and outcomes.',\n",

       " 'Background:  Cancer cells exploit cellular stress response mechanisms, such as the unfolded protein response, to survive through cytotoxic treatments.  A key mediator of the unfolded protein response, the 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) chaperone, is frequently found to be overexpressed in breast cancer.  In addition to providing a growth advantage to cancer cells, GRP78 induction can lead to drug resistance.  Suppressing GRP78 levels using siRNA has been shown to slow cancer cell progression and overcome drug resistance.  Another approach to inactivating GRP78 is by inhibiting its ATPase activity that has not received much attention.  GRP78 ATPase activity is important for its binding and release of misfolded proteins, thereby regulating its function as a chaperone.  Its ATP binding domain has also been shown to negatively regulate pro-apoptotic proteins.Hypothesis:  We propose a two-pronged approach to developing GRP78 inhibitors by (1) inhibiting its ATPase activity, and (2) downregulating its expression.  We hypothesize that GRP78 inhibitors (ATPase inhibitors and expression downregulators) will lead to accumulation of misfolded proteins and disrupt GRP78-mediated survival mechanisms.  We further hypothesize that these inhibitors will sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.Specific Aims:  Successful completion of our proposed study will demonstrate the clinical utility of GRP78 inhibitors and develop our lead compounds for further drug development.  Specifically, we propose to: (1) Optimize novel lead GRP78 inhibitors (ATPase inhibitors and expression downregulators) and characterize their inhibitory activity using various in vitro enzymatic and cell-based assays.  (2) Assess the in vitro anticancer effects of promising novel GRP78 inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines, both as single-agent and in combination with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.  (3) Assess the in vivo efficacy of promising novel GRP78 inhibitors in athymic nude mice xenograft models of breast cancer, both as a single-agent and in combination with doxorubicin and paclitaxel.Study Design:  Using several enzymatic and cell-based paradigms, we will evaluate the effects of our novel lead inhibitors on GRP78-mediated chaperone functions, survival signaling, cell proliferation and apoptosis.  We will further characterize the in vivo anticancer efficacy of these compounds and validate their effect on GRP78 expression in tumor samples from mice.Innovation:  Though there is ample evidence indicating a critical role of GRP78 in breast cancer progression and drug resistance, there are no selective GRP78 inhibitors currently available.  Most of the currently known inhibitors lack selectivity and potency and have unfavorable drug-like properties.  Recently, we identified the first-in-class novel and selective GRP78 inhibitors targeting its ATPase activity and expression.  Our research provides a novel therapeutic approach to overcoming drug resistance and improving breast cancer treatment outcomes by exploiting the importance of GRP78 in solid tumors.Impact:  Because inherent or acquired drug resistance to systemic therapy is a major cause for treatment failure in cancer, any approach that would decrease drug resistance is highly significant and would likely have a major impact on the eradication of cancer.  Therefore, our goal is to understand how GRP78 induces drug resistance and to design novel therapeutic agents to overcome it.  Through this proposed research, we expect to not only provide the proof of principle that inhibition of GRP78 activity and expression will sensitize breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, but also identify novel small-molecule GRP78 inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic properties, which can be further developed into potential therapeutics for clinical use in breast cancer patients with GRP78 overexpression.',\n",
       " 'Many types of tumor cells overexpress several cell surface transporters to capture nutrients.  The LAT1 transporter (a.k.a. the system L, Slc7a5) is a 12-transmembrane-pass Na+-independent transporter that directs the import of large neutral branched chain and aromatic amino acids (e.g., Phe, Trp) by exchange for intracellular glutamine.  It exists in co-complex with the protein CD98.  Our biological collaborator, John Cleveland, has shown that LAT1 expression is induced during tumorigenesis and its elevation is a hallmark of Myc-induced malignancies.  The expression of the LAT1/CD98 complex is highly elevated in many forms of breast cancer, including, for example, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancers, even in a premalignant state.  Cancer therapy through the targeting of the LAT1 transporter has only recently been described.  In a related National Institutes of Health-funded project, we have designed LAT1 substrates to selectively deliver antitumor agents to high LAT1-expressing cell types.  In that effort, we learned the molecular requirements for LAT1 recognition.  Specifically, binding relies upon interactions with hydrophobic amino acid side chains.  Several studies suggest that LAT1 inhibitors would be useful, including a published proof-of-concept study using the weak inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH).  Even such weak LAT1 inhibitors have been shown to compromise the growth and survival of breast cancer cells.  Higher affinity LAT1 inhibitors are needed to permit reduction of this potentially important therapeutic concept to practice.   The aims of our interdisciplinary medicinal chemistry, cancer biology, and drug discovery effort are to (1) generate new high-affinity LAT1 inhibitors in four distinct chemotypes; (2) study structure-activity relationships of lead compounds while optimizing their DMPK properties; (3) evaluate efficacy of leads using in-house ex vivo ER+ and triple-negative breast cancer models; (4) demonstrate LAT1 target specificity of our inhibitors; and (5) evaluate the in vivo efficacy of top leads using orthotopic xenograft models (in mice) of human ER+ and triple-negative breast cancer.  Our focused plan is designed to test the idea that potent LAT1 inhibitors will have broad and high-impact antitumor activity, including efficacy vs. several poorly treated breast cancer subtypes.',\n",

Colonoscopy is a highly effective clinical preventive service delivered in a variety of ambulatory settings, including both hospital-based and free-standing.

       " 'In 2002 we reported the occurence of avascular necrosis of bone (usually the hip) in 15 asymptomatic patients with HIV disease. We have continued to follow these asymptomatic patients, and have also enrolled a cohort of approximately 40 patients with symptomatic osteonecrosis.  This includes patients who were being followed in our clinic as well as patients referred from community physicians.  The occurrence of pain and functional disability is being assessed, with the primary endpoint being the time to joint replacement.  The radiographic evolution of hip lesions is also being evaluated by yearly MRIs.  In 2007, we published a summary of our experiences describing the incidence of osteonecrosis in our clinic population as well as the proportion of patients that needed to go on to surgical repair/joint replacement.  We found that most asymptomatic patients remained asymptomatic, though a small proportin developed symptoms and needed hip replacement.  We also found that among patients with symptomatic ostoenecrosis, the median time to hip replacement was under one year.  We are continuing to enroll patients with symptomatic disease and to follow these patients long term, as it is one of the largest such cohorts being followed.  This type of long term follow up is necessary in order to determine the long term natural history and clinical relevance of findings.',\n",
       " '1. Gender differences in fetal growth have been reported, but it is unknown if fetal growth rates, a reflection of genetic and environmental factors, express sexually dimorphic sensitivity to the mother. Our group investigated the homogeneity of male and female growth responses to maternal height and weight in 3,495 uncomplicated singleton pregnancies (1,814 males, 1,681 females) followed longitudinally.(1) Gender modified the effects of maternal height and weight on fetal growth rates and birth weight. Among males, tallest maternal height influenced fetal weight growth before 18 weeks of gestation, and pre-pregnancy maternal weight and body mass index subsequently had influence; this finding was not seen in females. Additionally, males were more sensitive to maternal weight among shorter mothers and more responsive to maternal height among lighter mothers, compared to females. A male advantage of 60 g occurred among neonates of the shortest and lightest mothers, compared to 150 and 191 g among short and heavy mothers, and tall and light-weight mothers, respectively. This study concluded that gender differences in response to maternal size are under-appreciated sources of variation in fetal growth studies and may reflect differential growth strategies.2. Iliac crest angle: a novel sonographic parameter for the prediction of Down syndrome risk during the second trimester of pregnancy. We investigated a new sonographic technique for the display and measurement of the fetal iliac crest angle (ICA) and determined its value estimating the risk of Down syndrome during the midtrimester.(2) Three-dimensional ultrasonography (3DUS) of the fetal pelvis was performed during genetic amniocenteses. Two different ICAs were measured from a coronal projection of the fetal pelvis. Axial inner (ICA-inner), middle (ICA-middle) and outer (ICA-outer) ICAs were also measured. Ninety-four normal fetuses and 19 fetuses with Down syndrome were examined. The ICA-middle and ICA-coronal 2 parameters were the most reproducible measurements. The mean ICA-middle measurement for fetuses with Down syndrome was significantly greater than that for normal subjects (94.5 vs. 83.1 degrees). The mean ICA-coronal 2 angle measurement for fetuses with Down syndrome was slightly greater than that for normal subjects (57.9 vs. 51.9 degrees). A multiple logistic regression model including ICA-middle and ICA-coronal 2 provided a predictive ability of 88.1%. This combination had a sensitivity of 94.4% for a false-positive rate of 5% in the detection of Down syndrome. We propose that standardized ICA measurements of the fetal pelvis can be used to identify some fetuses at risk for trisomy 21 during the midtrimester of pregnancy.3. Evaluation of the soft tissue of fetal limbs with 3DUS is feasible. The use of fractional limb volume addresses the technical limitations of fetal weight estimation. Our group conducted a study(3) to determine the accuracy and precision of new fetal weight estimation models, based on fractional limb volume and conventional two-dimensional (2D) sonographic measurements during the second and third trimesters. A prospective cross-sectional study of 271 fetuses was performed using 3DUS and measuring biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC) and femoral diaphysis length (FDL)-plus fractional arm volume (AVol) and fractional thigh volume (TVol) within 4 days of delivery. Weighted multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop modified Hadlock models and new models using transformed predictors that included soft tissue parameters for estimating birth weight. Six new models were very accurate, with mean percent differences not significantly different from zero. Model 3 (ln of BPD, AC and AVol) and Model 6 (ln of BPD, AC and TVol) provided the most precise weight estimations (random error=6.6% of actual birth weight) as compared with 8.5% for the best original Hadllock model and 7.6% for a modified Hadlock model. This study demonstrates that the precision of fetal weight estimation can be improved by adding fractional limb volume measurements to conventional 2D biometry. These new models may offer novel insight into the contribution of soft tissue development to weight estimation.4. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during pregnancy is increasing. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides an image contrast that is based on the molecular motion of water - a process that can be altered by the presence of disease. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is based on these principles and reflects water movement within the tissue environment. We conducted a study(4) to develop a reproducible method for estimating the diffusion of water in human fetal lung tissue using DWI. A secondary objective was to determine the relationship of the ADCs in the fetal lung to menstrual age and total lung volume. Normal pregnant volunteers underwent MRI. Simple linear regression was performed with Pearson correlation coefficient. Inter- and intra-examiner bias and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were determined. Forty-seven scans were performed at a mean of 29.2 weeks. The median coefficient of variation for ADC was 5.6%. No differences in ADC values were found between right and left lungs. Normally distributed ADC measurements were not significantly correlated with either total lung volume or menstrual age. The mean ADC value was 1.75. Mean intra-examiner bias was -0.15 and inter-examiner bias was 2.2. These findings suggest that ADC measurements of the fetal lung are reproducible between blinded examiners and are independent of menstrual age or lung volume.(4)5. A sonographic short cervix (SCX) is the most powerful predictor of preterm delivery. We investigated the frequency and clinical significance of intra-amniotic inflammation IAI, amniotic fluid (AF) MMP-8 >23 ng/mL in a cohort of 47 asymptomatic women with a SCX ( < or = 15 mm) between 14-24 weeks.(5) We found intra-amniotic infection in 4.3% of patients. Among those with a negative AF culture, the prevalence of IAI was 22% and patients with a negative AF culture, but with IAI, had a higher rate of delivery within 7 days (40% vs 5.7%) and a shorter median diagnosis-to-delivery interval than those without IAI (18 vs 42 days).(5) Moreover, we investigated whether the risk of early spontaneous preterm delivery (sPTD) in asymptomatic women with a SCX changes as a function of gestational age at diagnosis.(6) This cohort study included 109 asymptomatic singleton pregnancies with a SCX at 14-24 weeks, who were stratified by gestational age at diagnosis. Women diagnosed with a SCX <20 weeks had a higher rate of sPTD at <28 weeks (77% vs. 31%) and at <32 weeks (81% vs. 48%), and a shorter median diagnosis-to-delivery interval (21 vs. 61.5 days) than those diagnosed at 20-24 weeks. The rate of amniotic fluid  sludge  was higher among patients diagnosed at <20 weeks than those diagnosed between 20-24 weeks (92% vs. 48%).(6) We further evaluated the pregnancy outcome of asymptomatic patients with a non-measurable cervical length (0 mm) between 14-28 weeks.(7) This retrospective cohort study included 78 patients with singleton pregnancies. We found that in 75% of the patients delivered <32 weeks of gestation, the median diagnosis-to-delivery interval was 20.5 days, and the delivery rate within 7 and 14 days was 28% and 36%, respectively. Patients with a non-measurable cervix diagnosed at <24 weeks had a shorter median diagnosis-to-delivery interval than those diagnosed between 24-28 weeks (17.5 vs 41 days).(7) These studies(5-7) demonstrate that a sonographic SCX in the midtrimester is a risk factor for preterm delivery and IAI, and that almost 65% of asymptomatic women with a 0 mm cervix in the second trimester will not deliver within 2 weeks, yet 75% of them will deliver before 32 weeks of gestation.',\n",
       " 'In our earlier studies we have developed experimental models for the triggering of symptoms in both premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMD) and postpartum depression that we continue to employ in our efforts to identify both the underlying biology of these conditions as well as the development of new safe and effective therapies for women with these conditions.  As a continuation of these studies, we have demonstrated that women with PMD who respond to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced ovarian suppression experience a recurrence of PMD after the initial re-exposure to combined estradiol and progesterone (but not placebo).  However, recurrent symptoms do not occur once hormone levels are stabilized over the subsequent two months of continuous replacement therapy.  These observations are of both clinical and scientific importance, as they identify promising phenotypes and suggest the physiologic basis for the susceptibility to experience PMD and will also provide alternative hormone-based therapies for women with this condition.  Approximately 60-70% of women with PMD show symptomatic improvement in response to the GnRH agonist-induced ovarian suppression.  It has been very difficult to predict why some women respond, while others do not.  We identified a suite of statistical descriptors of pre-treatment mood rating data to have high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the clinical response to ovarian suppression in PMD by applying chaos-based Approximate Entropy (ApEn) modeling to mood rating data.  Relatively regular and non-spiky pre-trial dynamics of mood ratings predict a positive response to ovarian suppression with high probability.  In contrast, mean symptom levels were indistinct between the subgroups.  We are presently in the latter stages of a follow-up study employing these same statistical measures involving the response of women with PMD to fluoxetine.  In contrast to our findings with leuprolide, none of the statistical measures distinguished responders from nonresponders to fluoxetine.  Thus, these data suggest that the pattern of symptoms cyclicity predicts a differential response to hormonal therapy versus a psychotropic agent.  These statistical measures may have broad applicability to behavioral studies for many psychiatric disorders, facilitating both accurate diagnosis and the prediction of response to treatment.  As an indirect measure of the relevance of declining ovarian steroid secretion in PPD, we examine the efficacy of estradiol in the treatment of PPD.  Women with PPD (both those nursing and those who are bottle-feeding their babies) are randomized in a double-blind, parallel design to receive either 17 beta estradiol (100 mcgs daily by skin patch) or placebo for six weeks.  Preliminary results suggest that mood rating scores are improved compared with both baseline and scores in women receiving placebo.  Differences between estradiol and placebo treatments were apparent by four weeks, reminiscent of the relatively rapid antidepressant effects of estradiol therapy in depressed perimenopausal women.  If these findings are confirmed in a larger sample, estradiol treatment may not only provide a safe and effective alternative to traditional antidepressants in women with postpartum depression (both nursing and non-nursing mothers), but it may also suggest the relevant hormonal trigger for the development of this condition.  In addition to our studies on the behavioral effects of changes in sex steroids across the menstrual cycle and during the postpartum, we employ a number of methodologies to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms of these conditions including studies employing multimodal neuroimaging such as positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  Our neuroimaging protocols demonstrated for the first time in humans a differential reward-related pattern of brain activation in the orbital frontal cortex and the amygdala during the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle using fMRI technology.  We also perform O15 PET studies in women who are participating in the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism study.  In this study, cognitive activation is achieved using the N-back test which allows us to vary the cognitive load and the effort required to perform the task.  Differences in brain activation between the 2-back and 0-back (control) tasks were compared across hormone conditions in women with and those without PMD.  Preliminary results suggest that during the N-back testing, women with PMD show abnormal recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with greater activation in the right dlPFC, and reduced activation in the left DLPFC an asymmetry not observed in the asymptomatic controls.  These findings are robust and observable in both 015PET and fMRI techniques.  Interestingly, scores on the global assessment of function scale, a measure of the severity of the functional impairment accompanying each womans PMD, correlate with activity within the medial frontal and precentral gyri.  Future findings in these studies may identify disturbances of a process that is critical to the clinical phenomenology of PMD, a functional disturbance of the normal modulatory effect of gonadal steroids, and a locus of the disturbance.  Our therapeutic clinical trials have demonstrated that the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, a medication that inhibits neurosteroid synthesis has no effect on either the symptoms of PMD or the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge prior to ovulation.  We are evaluating the effects of a higher dose of dutasteride (i.e., 2.5 mg daily) in women with PMD and an asymptomatic comparison group.  However, our preliminary findings suggest that neither alterations in the plasma levels nor a deficiency of neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, play a critical role in the pathophysiology of PMD.We are collaborating with Dr. Rima Kaddurah-Daouk at Duke University to more comprehensively examine neurosteroid metabolism with metabolomic tools.  Our strategy is to perform metabolomic studies in women with PMD who respond to Lupron with elimination of symptoms and who experience return of symptoms during progesterone or estradiol replacement.  We now have the capacity to examine steroid and steroid metabolites employing a new platform designed for lipid-soluble molecules.  Thus, we now want to specifically examine the effects of both estradiol and progesterone on the pattern of steroid metabolites in women with PMD and an asymptomatic comparison group who participate in the Lupron paradigm.Finally, we have completed our study of HPA axis function in women with and without premenstrual dysphoria under conditions of GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism and estradiol and progesterone replacement.  We have adequately demonstrated and confirmed previous findings that even under conditions of dexamethasone suppression progesterone results in an increase in several measures of cortisol and ACTH secretion.  However, the effects of progesterone (or either hypogonadism or estradiol) on HPA axis function did not differ between women with PMD and controls.  Thus, although mood symptoms in women with PMD were largely confined to the progesterone add back phase and progesterone increased HPA axis response, the regulation of HPA axis function did not differ in PMD compared with controls.  These data suggest that HPA axis function in women with PMD is normal.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a major public health concern, affecting more than 5.5 million Americans, with over 550,000 new cases diagnosed each year, and accounting for up to 10% of all hospital admissions. Depression is the most robust behavioral predictor of morbidity and premature mortality among patients with symptomatic HF, with an incidence ranging from 20% to 45%, depending on HF severity. Our ongoing project HL-073355 is examining the pathophysiology associated with depression in HF patients. Few studies have systematically examined the development and progression of depression concurrent with the development of and progression to symptomatic HF and its associated neuroimmune and behavioral mechanisms. By enrolling individuals at risk for developing symptomatic HF but who are currently asymptomatic, namely American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Stage B patients, this competing renewal of HL-073355 will prospectively track the incidence and time course of depressive symptoms and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the development of symptomatic HF, potential neuroimmune and behavioral mechanisms linking HF and MDD, and associations with cardiovascular clinical outcomes. We will enroll 522 high-risk (defined as BNP >100pg/ml) ACC/AHA Stage B patients, study them at intake, and every 6 months for an average of 30 months. Through our strong collaborations with the HF teams at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Hillcrest and La Jolla Medical Centers, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) in La Jolla, we have access to a large number of asymptomatic Stage B patients. Clinical assessments will include echocardiography and characterization of depressive symptoms by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID). Neuroimmune assessments will include circulating levels of BNP, CRP, TNF-1, IL-12, IL-6, sICAM-1, sP-selectin, catecholamines, and functional assessments of leukocytes. In addition to depression, other behavioral and psychosocial assessments will include sleep, health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity), psychosocial stressors, coping, anxiety, social network, and quality of life. Clinical outcomes will include transition from asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction to symptomatic Stages C and/or D HF, clinical cardiovascular outcomes (combined hospitalizations for cardiovascular events and/or death), and the development or recurrence of MDD. Findings from this prospective study have the potential to add new insights into how MDD might contribute to HF progression at early stages of the disease. A greater understanding of the role and mechanisms by which MDD may impact HF at this stage could support clinically relevant early MDD intervention efforts at a point when effective depression treatment could have a potentially greater impact on the course of HF.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is the most robust behavioral predictor of morbidity and premature mortality among patients with heart failure, although the mechanisms of this relationship are poorly understood. In a cohort of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) classification asymptomatic Stage B patients, we will prospectively track depressive symptoms, the development and progression to symptomatic Stages C/D heart failure, and associations with adverse clinical cardiovascular outcomes, as well as determine potential neuroimmune and behavioral and psychosocial mechanisms within a naturalistic framework.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   While symptomatic congestive heart failure from coronary artery disease is increasing in prevalence, there are even more patients that have asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Asymptomatic LVSD (or Stage B heart failure) accounts for the majority of patients with a depressed ejection fraction and coronary artery disease. Some of these patients have prior myocardial infarctions and nontransmural scars from the contemporary management of ST elevation MI with reperfusion therapy. Others have viable dysfunctional myocardium reflecting the slow but cumulative myocyte loss from repetitive ischemia and left ventricular remodeling. This proposal is intended to determine whether intracoronary cell based therapy can ameliorate regional LV dysfunction at a stage of disease where clinical heart failure is absent and ongoing myocyte death and neurohormonal activation are minimal. The central hypothesis is that a myocardial microenvironment devoid of ongoing stressors promoting cell death will facilitate exogenous and endogenous myocyte regeneration from cell based therapy. Our completed work in a model of hibernating myocardium devoid of infarction supports this hypothesis and demonstrates that intracoronary mesenchymal stem cells (icMSCs) stimulate endogenous myocyte proliferation through a paracrine mechanism with a resultant increase in myocyte nuclear density. Cardiosphere derived cells (CDCs) isolated from myocardial biopsies provide an alternative source of adult stem cells that have been demonstrated to improve function after intracoronary injection through both direct differentiation into cardiac myocytes as well as by stimulating endogenous myocyte proliferation. In a head-to-head fashion, this proposal will determine the relative efficacy of these two therapies in viable dysfunctional myocardium vs. reperfused myocardial infarcts prior to the development of heart failure. To ultimately enhance translation, studies will be conducted in swine with a heart size similar to humans. Aim 1 will determine whether icCDCs are superior to icMSCs in chronic regional LV dysfunction. They will also define whether treatments are more efficacious when administered to hibernating vs. infarcted myocardium. Physiological end-points will include improvement in regional LV function and myocardial perfusion at rest and vasodilation. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of icMSCs and CDCs to amplify endogenous myocyte proliferation vs. differentiation of stem cells into a cardiac phenotype. Serial stem cell fate will be tracked in vivo using PET/CT 18[F]FHBG imaging of cells transfected with a lentiviral triple reporter construct complimented with fluorescence and bioluminescence in tissue samples. Serial assessment of LV mass, volumes and infarct size from imaging will be complimented with immunohistochemistry to quantify the amount of new myocardium regenerated. Aim 3 will use a discovery based proteomic approach employing label free LC/MS to identify paracrine factors differentially upregulated following icCDCs and icMSCs. The results will identify the stem cell and pathological substrate most likely to benefit patients with asymptomatic LVSD before clinical heart failure develops.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project is highly relevant to the contemporary management of the vast majority of patients following reperfused myocardial infarction as well as chronic coronary artery disease where LV systolic function is mildly depressed without symptomatic heart failure. Demonstrating a beneficial effect of stem cell therapies on myocardial regeneration could change our current treatment paradigm which focuses on advanced end-stage disease to one that employs cell based therapy to prevent the progression of asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction to clinical heart failure.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virally-encoded neuraminidase plays a key role in the life-cycle of the influenza virus. A class of anti-influenza drugs that inhibits the action of neuraminidase has garnered increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their selectivity and potency. The inhibitors are transition state analogs of the enzyme substrate, sialic acid, and are highly efficacious in in vitro and in vivo studies, with IC50 values in the nM range. However these drugs are very polar and consequently have poor oral bioavailability. At TSRL, we have a developed an amino acid prodrug strategy that targets intestinal transporters for enhanced uptake. Subsequent activation of the absorbed prodrug can then occur either through targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of the prodrug or chemical breakdown of the prodrug to the activate parent compound. This strategy is based on a molecular mechanistic understanding of the transport and activation pathways in cells and tissues and the interaction of prodrug structures with these pathways. In this proposal, we have developed novel amino acid prodrugs of two neuraminidase inhibitors and provide strong supporting data showing that these prodrugs are actively transported by intestinal transporter and are well absorbed. We show that through our approach, we can boost the oral availability of selected neuraminidase inhibitors to an extent that they are effective in animal models of influenza and have high potential to be developed as oral drug products. In the current project, we propose to select a lead neuraminidase inhibitor by in vivo (mouse and ferret) testing of the developed series of compounds against a range of influenza strains, including recent H1N1 isolates, seasonal flu isolates, drug resistant virus and high pathogenic strains of the virus. Our  molecular mechanistic  approach to prodrug design has enormous potential for the development of orally effective neuraminidase inhibitors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TSRL has developed an approach to improve the oral bioavailability of anti-influenza drugs, thus making them suitable for oral delivery. We propose to synthesize and test a series of these compounds for their potential as oral anti-influenza agents. Ultimately, this approach may increase the number of potent anti-virus compounds that are available for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of influenza.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TB diagnosis in India relies on clinical symptoms, microscopic examination of smears made directly from sputum and/or chest X-rays (CXR). The immune dysfunction caused by HIV-infection alters clinical and radiological presentation of TB, and microbiological confirmation of TB is problematic since HIV+TB+ patients have increased frequency of smear-negative (SN) TB and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Despite being totally treatable with the existing drugs, the poorer performance of insensitive diagnostic tests in HIV+ patients leads to significant under-diagnosis of TB in the very population where TB progression is rapid and often fatal. A simple, rapid test to identify smear-positive (SP) and SN symptomatic or asymptomatic TB in HIV+ patients would have significant impact on TB-related morbidity and mortality. Five immunogenic proteins of M. tuberculosis that are potential candidates for devising a simple diagnostic test for TB in HIV+ patients have been identified. These are MS, MPT51, PPE55, ESAT6 and CFP10. Antibodies (Abs) to these antigens have been demonstrated at all levels of immune-suppression, regardless of pulmonary manifestations and site of TB in HIV+TB+ patients, and are also detectable in sera of asymptomatic HIV+ patients who progressed to symptomatic TB in the subsequent 2-6 months. Absence of Abs to these antigens in retrospective sera from CD4 T cell-matched HIV+ patients who did not eventually develop TB suggests that in HIV+ patients, these Ab responses signal active TB whether or not clinical symptoms of TB are present and before the bacterial burden reaches the threshold of detection by direct microscopy. In the current studies we propose to evaluate the potential of these Abs to identify SN and SP symptomatic/asymptomatic HIV+TB+ patients in prospective studies and to map their dominant epitopes that are recognized by Abs in Indian patients. For this, we will recruit a cohort of ~200 ART-na¿ve HIV+ patients and investigate them for TB using direct microscopy as well as with decontaminated/concentrated sputum smears, cultures on solid media and NAAT evaluation of sputum, blood and urine (Aim 1); evaluate the presence of Abs to recombinant purified MS, MPT51, ESAT6, CFP10 and PPE55 in serum specimens from the recruited individuals and correlate the presence of Abs with bacteriological confirmation of TB (Aim 2) and identify the immunodominant epitopes on the 5 antigens recognized by serum Abs from Indian patients on peptide microarrays to define peptides that can be used to devise a peptide-based rapid test for TB in Indian HIV+ patients.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The immune dysfunction caused by HIV-infection alters clinical and radiological presentation of TB, and microbiological confirmation of TB is problematic since HIV+TB+ patients have increased frequency of smear- negative (SN) TB and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Despite being totally treatable with the existing drugs, the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools results in identification of less than half of the HIV+TB+ patients being diagnosed before death in TB-endemic countries. More sensitive diagnostic tests like microscopy with decontaminated and concentrated smears, culture of M. tb and PCR-based nucleic acid-amplification tests (NAAT) significantly enhance the identification of SN patients. However, routine implementation of these advanced diagnostic techniques is not economically feasible in high-burden countries. Studies over the last 15 years have led to the identification, cloning, and evaluation of a panel of well-defined highly immunogenic proteins of M. tb that are potential candidates for devising a simple diagnostic test for TB in HIV+ patients whether or not clinical symptoms of TB are present and before the bacterial burden reaches the threshold of detection by direct microscopy. The goal of the current studies is to evaluate the ability of Abs to these antigens to detect SN and SP symptomatic/asymptomatic HIV+TB+ patients in prospective studies. We will also map the dominant epitopes of these proteins that are recognized by Abs in Indian patients that may be used to devise a peptide-based rapid diagnostic test for HIV+TB+ patients.',\n",
       " \"The increasing prevalence of obesity in youth has become a public health crisis, especially for minority adolescents. Behaviors that have been shown to be effective in reducing obesity (i.e., sedentary behavior (SB), physical activity (PA), diet) in youth are influenced by their parents and peer interactions. Preliminary focus groups conducted by the fellowship candidate suggest that because African American caregivers are engaging in many positive parenting behaviors such as monitoring, expanding these practices to specifically target their adolescent's health behaviors is promising. Previous studies also indicate that parents may play a role in shaping health behaviors by monitoring their own child's behavior in addition to their child's peer relationships. Furthermore, the balance between setting limits and autonomy around health behaviors may be based on a set of interactions in which adolescents and parents collaborate in the decision-making process. While interventions that have sought to improve PA and diet in African American families, few have included parent components around rules and monitoring in adolescents. Furthermore, few have targeted parental management of peer interactions around these behaviors. The purpose of this project is to test the feasibility of a novel 8-week interactive parent intervention that targets parent variables (i.e., rules, autonomy support, monitoring) to facilitate peer interactions which decrease SB and consumption of unhealthy (i.e., high fat, high sugar) foods and increase PA and fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption in African American adolescents. Seventy adolescents and their caregivers will be randomized to either an interactive parent-based intervention (IPB) or a general health education program (GHE). The IPB intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and will target parent variables through 8 weekly sessions designed to teach parents how to further refine their parenting strategies (i.e., rules, autonomy support, monitoring) in order to effectively impact the relationship between peer interactions and adolescent self-efficacy and self-concept specific to SB, PA, and diet. The essential elements of the intervention include: rules, autonomy support, monitoring, peer support, adolescent self-efficacy and self-concept. The GHE program will also include 8 weekly group sessions on general health issues. It is hypothesized that adolescents in the IPB group will demonstrate greater reductions in SB and consumption of high-fat/high sugar foods and greater increases PA and FV consumption compared to those in the GHE group. Similarly, it is hypothesized that caregivers and adolescents will demonstrate greater improvements in parent variables (rules, autonomy support, monitoring) and self-efficacy and self-concept specific to SB, PA, and diet in the IPB intervention compared with caregivers and adolescents in the GHE group at post-intervention, respectively. Finally, this study will explore whether changes in key variables (e.g., peer support, rules, monitoring, and adolescent self-efficacy) may mediate the effect of the intervention on changes in adolescent SB, PA, diet in the IPB group at 8-weeks post-intervention.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Bacillus subtilis produces a wide array of extracellular metabolites that can inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi or modify their behavior to attenuate the production of antibacterial products by potentially dangerous neighbors. We here propose to use the new technique of imaging mass spectrometry and classical analytical chemistry to systematically identify the extracellular metabolome of B. subtilis, with a focus on characterizing the interactive metabolome that is induced by other bacterial species. We will investigate the role these compounds play in two distinct outcomes of the interaction of B. subtilis with other species. The first is an impasse, in which B. subtilis forms closely abutting colonies with other species that produce a variety of antibacterial compounds (such as P. aeruginosa). The second, more frequent behavior is contact-dependent predation, in which B. subtilis moves towards, invades and destroys neighboring colonies, leading to death of the prey species and expanding the territory of the B. subtilis colony. These reproducible behaviors are conserved in different undomesticated B. subtilis strains. We will determine if these behaviors depend on the interactive metabolome and investigate the effects individual compounds have on target cell viability and behavior. We will further investigate the genetic requirements for interspecies interactions to identify stress responses, developmental and biosynthetic pathways that contribute to these distinct outcomes and we will use fluorescence microscopy to visualize the cellular consequences of interspecies interactions. These studies will illuminate the mechanistic basis for interspecies interactions and identify secondary metabolites that affect viability or behavior of other species that represent potential new antibacterial drugs.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Bacteria produce many extracellular metabolites that mediate their interaction with other species, many of which have antibacterial and antifungal activities. We will here elucidate the chemical, genetic and cellular mechanisms by which these molecules allow Bacillus subtilis to interact with other bacterial species, producing outcomes ranging from coexistence to the invasion and destruction of neighboring colonies. Interspecies interactions are critical in medicine and the metabolites that facilitate destruction of other species represent promising new pharmaceutical leads.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor Nrf2 has emerged as a master regulator of a cellular protective mechanism by upregulating antioxidant response element (ARE)-bearing genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, and stress response proteins. Keap1, a substrate adaptor protein for a Cullin3 (Cul3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, tightly regulates the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is constantly targeted for Keap1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation to maintain a low constitutive level in al human organs. Upon activation of the pathway, the enzymatic activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2 downstream genes. Since the discovery of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway in 1999, Nrf2 has been viewed as a  good  transcription factor that protects us from oxidative stress-related diseases, including cancer. The chemopreventive property of Nrf2 has been well documented by the following two facts: (i) many of the well- studied chemopreventive compounds elicit their activities through activation of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway, and (ii) Nrf2-null mice are highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and are no longer protected by chemopreventive compounds. Paradoxically, the  dark side  of Nrf2 has recently been revealed. For instance, somatic mutations that disrupt the Keap1-mediated negative regulation of Nrf2, resulting in a high constitutive level of Nrf2, have been identified in several types of tumors and cancer cel lines, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Furthermore, mounting evidence has emerged, indicating that Nrf2 contributes to chemoresistance, the major obstacle in cancer treatment. The discovery of the  dark side  of Nrf2 has clearly illustrated the urgent need to identify Nrf2 inhibitors and develop them into druggable compounds to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. We have screened a large number of natural products for their inhibition of ARE-luciferase activity using a stable cell line established in our lab, MDA-MB-231-ARE-Luc, containing an ARE (from GST-Ya)-dependent luciferase gene. Using this method, we have identified a plant extract that is able to inhibit ARE-luciferase activity. Furthermore, a pure compound, brusatol, has been isolated from the extract and has been found to inhibit the protein level of Nrf2 and exhibit potent anti-cancer activities. So far, we have obtained a substantial amount of preliminary data demonstrating that brusatol sensitizes several cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and, more significantly, brusatol sensitizes lung cancer xenografts to cisplatin in vivo in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Based on the ability of brusatol to specifically inhibit Nrf2 and sensitize cultured cancer cells and xenografts to cisplatin treatments, we hypothesize that brusatol can enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through inhibition of the Nrf2-dependant protective mechanism. The goal of the proposed research is to further characterize the anti-cancer properties of brusatol using a preclinical lung cancer model and delineate the molecular targets and mechanistic actions of brusatol. The proposed study will not only provide a framework for the development of this Nrf2 inhibitor into a therapeutic drug to combat chemoresistance, but also provide the first Nrf2 inhibitor for basic research in the field, both of which will have profound impacts on human health worldwide. Therefore, the following three aims will be pursued: Aim #1. Characterize the mechanistic actions of brusatol-mediated Nrf2 inhibition Nrf2 is primarily regulated by the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase at the protein level through ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, we will investigate the effects of brusatol on the proteins that may enhance the activity of the E3 ligase, such as the protein subunits of the E3 ligase, as well as regulatory proteins that control the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the ligase complex. Aim #2. Determine the molecular targets of brusatol The target proteins of brusatol will be identified and verified. The biological functions of these proteins, in particular their crosstalk with the Nrf2 signaling pathway, wil be investigated. Most likely, these proteins will directly or indirectly regulate the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase. Aim #3. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of brusatol using an LSL-KrasG12D/+ mouselung cancer model The feasibility of using brusatol as an adjuvant to enhance current cancer treatments and to combat both intrinsic and acquired resistance will be tested in this preclinical model that recapitulates the development and progression of human lung cancer. !  !    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Little progress has been made in the treatment of lung cancer due to high resistance of lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatments. Nrf2 is a protein that regulates one of the most important cellular defense mechanisms to cope with environmental toxins and chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, inhibition of Nrf2 represents a novel mechanism to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. This proposal focuses on the discovery and development of a phytochemical, brusatol, into a druggable compound that inhibits the Nrf2- mediated protective pathway, enhancing the effectiveness of a broad range of cancer treatments. In addition, mechanistic actions of brusatol will also be investigated.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a known cause of stroke in about 80,000 patients every year in US. In addition it is suspected to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, despite being such a common health problem, the prevalence of this disease is unclear. Also, the degree of association of ICAD with cognitive impairment and dementia remains unstudied. We plan to study the prevalence of ICAD in US elderly population and also determine its association with cognitive impairment and dementia. Aims: The broad objective of our proposed project is to conduct an ancillary study in the subsample of 2000 subjects who are undergoing MRI in ARIC-NCS. Aims are 1) to estimate the prevalence of ICAD in the ARIC participant aged 70-89 years and 2) to determine whether ICAD is associated with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Design/Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities is an NHBLI funded cardiovascular cohort that has followed about 16,000 subjects, aged 45-64 for last 25 years. Now, ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), funded by NHLBI, will perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2000 of the remaining 7000 subjects. Neurocognitive testing will be performed as part of ARIC-NCS and the sample of 2000 subjects selected for MRI will include subjects with dementia (n=358), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=761), and normal participants (n=878). We plan to acquire magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies on these 2000 subjects at the same time MRI images are being acquired for ARIC-NCS. We will measure luminal stenosis, a standard clinical parameter for ICAS, using MRA. In addition, we will measure intracranial vessel wall thickness, using a novel high-resolution MRI sequence. Vessel wall thickness may detect atherosclerotic changes without any significant stenosis and may be a better measure of atherosclerotic disease burden. In addition, compared to luminal stenosis, vessel wall thickness may also be more strongly associated with cognitive impairment or dementia. We will use two different definitions of ICAD to determine prevalence 1. luminal narrowing of >50%, and 2. vessel wall thickness of >0.6-mm. Implications. The study is based on new data that suggests asymptomatic ICAD is associated with cognitive impairment among elderly persons in the general population. Furthermore, asymptomatic ICAD may be associated with cognitive impairment in the absence of cerebral infarctions on MRI due to chronic hypoperfusion in the elderly population. This will also be the first study to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAD in the US elderly population and its impact upon cognitive impairment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis will help us study the primary prevention of stroke. If intracranial atherosclerosis is identified to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, it will offer promise toward search of preventive and therapeutic treatments of these common and major health issues.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The limitations of HIV-1 therapeutics, which include viral drug resistance and off-target effects, provide the impetus for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new anti-HIV-1 drugs. Previous in vitro data found that the combination of two clinically approved drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine, reduced HIV-1 infectivity by 73% at concentrations that had minimal antiviral activity when used individually. Decreased infectivity coincided with a significant increase in mutant frequency and a shift in the HIV-1 mutant spectra by combining a nucleoside analog that forms non-canonical base pairs with certain ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors. Increased mutational load is implicated as the primary antiviral mechanism for inhibiting the generation of infectious progeny virus from provirus, and support a model in which increased mutation frequency decreases infectivity through lethal mutagenesis. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that error-prone viral replication may induce  error catastrophe  or extinction in vivo due to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. Strategies designed to drive viruses to error catastrophe have been applied to HIV-1 and a number of RNA viruses however for the most part they have not been evaluated in vivo for their ability to effectively control HIV replication. Here, we propose to use a novel humanized mouse model to investigate 1) the ability of decitabine and gemcitabine to control viral replication in vivo, and 2) the ability of the decitabine/gemcitabine drug combination to control HIV replication in vivo by elevating the viral mutational load.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-1 drug resistance and side effects can limit the long-term effectiveness of antiretroviral activity, requiring the continual need for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new anti-HIV-1 drugs.',\n",
       " 'Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi causes disease in millions of individuals who ingest contaminated food or water. Ingested S. enterica serovar Typhi organisms infect macrophages in the Peyer¿s patches, which then carry the infection to other organs including the liver and the spleen. This results in either systemic disease, clearance of the organism, or an asymptomatic carrier state in which individuals shed the organism for life. Which of these outcomes will occur depends in large part on the status of the infected individual¿s CD4+ T cells. Current vaccines consisting of killed or attenuated organisms provide some degree of protective immunity, but this immunity is not completely effective. Thus, a need exists for a better vaccine. We believe that the best way to accomplish this goal is by understanding natural immunity in asymptomatic carriers. Our goal is to do this by studying immunity to S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) in mouse strains that naturally develop a persistent asymptomatic infection of phagocytes that is similar to the carrier state in humans. During the last funding period we developed a sensitive new technique to detect polyclonal peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II molecule (pMHCII)-specific CD4+ T cells and used it to track CD4+ T cells expressing STpMHCII-specific T cell receptors (TCR) in these mice. We found that these T cells underwent massive expansion in the spleen and lymph nodes following intragastric infection, uniformly differentiated into ¿multifunctional¿ IFN-&#947;/TNF-producing Th1 cells, persisted at a high and stable level for hundreds of days, and controlled the infection without disease. We will determine whether these T cells are necessary and sufficient for protection and identify the mechanisms by which they are protective. We will also study how multifunctional Th1 cells are generated and avoid exhaustion during persistent ST infection with the idea that recurrent TCR stimulation by STpMHCII+ phagocytes in the lymphoid organs harboring infected phagocytes interspersed by periods of rest in uninfected tissues is involved. We will attempt to produce these conditions with a vaccine composed of slowly biodegradable poly(&#949;-caprolactone) rods impregnated with antigens, peptides, adjuvants, and inhibitors of negative immune regulation. This research is significant because it could set the stage for a long sought after vaccine that operates via T cell mediated immunity. It is innovative because it is driven by the idea that anatomically confined chronic infection is the best way to generate multifunctional Th1 cells capable of controlling intracellular bacterial infections and because it will be pursued with novel T cell tracking technology.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this Project is to identify a subset of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of probands with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are currently asymptomatic but who demonstrate both genotypic and phenotypic characteristics that are highly predictive of the development of RA within 3-5 years. We believe that identifying and further characterizing this very high risk population is key to the future goal of developing a primary prevention strategy that would target those individuals for therapeutic intervention prior to the onset of clinically active RA. As part of a funded R01, over the next five years we will finish enrolling and fully evaluating 2100 FDRs of probands with RA. Based on preliminary data, we expect to find a substantial number of FDRs who exhibit patterns of RA-related autoantibodies associated with progression to RA but who do not yet have clinically active disease. From the probands as well as these FDRs, we will also obtain biologic samples that can be used for DNA and other biomarker analysis. We are funded in that R01 to perform RA-related autoantibody and HLA-DR shared epitope analysis, and to re-evaluate FDRs serially in order to follow clinical phenotypes and obtain serial biologic samples. Because of the study design, FDRs can also be readily stratified for the new studies we propose herein by clinical phenotype, RA shared epitope or other genotype, and autoantibody status. Based on additional preliminary data, we expect to find, using both cross sectional and serial analyses, that the RA-associated autoantibody positive FDR group can be further divided into a population that does not exhibit additional biomarkers that are very likely to be associated with progression to clinically active RA, and a population that does exhibit such features of progression. We also expect to find evidence of B and T cell dysfunction in unaffected FDRs who exhibit RArelated autoantibodies and will have a unique opportunity to detect pathogenic T cell epitopes. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim #1: Determine the proportion of asymptomatic autoantibody-positive FDRs who also exhibit additional biomarkers typically found in patients with active RA. Specific Aim #2: Determine in asymptomatic FDRs the relationships of RA-related autoantibodies and biomarkers to the presence of specific genetic alleles and HLA haplotypes that are associated with the classification of active RA. Specific Aim #3: Examine FDRs who exhibit RA-related autoantibodies for the presence of dysregulated B and T cell immune responses to RA-related autoantigens.',\n",

This research is an ongoing, multidisciplinary prospective longitudinal study of CMV infection in mothers and their infants.  Two hundred three subjects with virologically confirmed congenital CMV infection, 103 asymptomatic, 62 symptomatic, and 38 uninfected controls now have been enrolled, and are being followed.  Mean age at last follow-up is now 5.4 years for symptomatic, 8 years for asymptomatic, and 13 years for control subjects.  CT scans have been performed on 60/62 of the symptomatic infants (67% were abnormal), and 90/103 asymptomatics (26% were abnormal).  Audiologic assessments have been performed in 60/62 symptomatics (67% have hearing loss), 98/103 asymptomatics (15% have hearing loss).  The aims for the next 5 years are to continue careful follow-up to characterize the incidence of hearing loss as to age at onset, unilateral vs. bilateral, severity, fluctuation, and progression, to determine correlation of very high frequency losses and abnormal cochlear emissions studies with hearing loss, and to relate abnormal CT scans to audiologic and developmental outcome.  The differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic congenitally infected subjects and uninfected controls will be compared to determine neonatal predictors of outcome at school age and longitudinal follow-up will continue through high school to document late sequelae that may occur during adolescence.\",\n",

These disorders include growth failure with lower lean body mass (LBM). Although the clinical features of this metabolic derangement is described, its mechanistic underpinnings are unknown. It is important to delineate these mechanisms in order to establish new therapies for pediatric patients because growth failure will lead to stunting. In this project we plan to test the hypothesis that HIV-infected children have a lower LBM due to a deficit in net protein synthesis because of upregulated protein catabolism. To test this hypothesis we propose to conduct stable isotope tracer experiments to achieve the following specific aim:  measure lean body mass (LBM) and protein kinetics in HIV-infected prepubertal children versus age-and gender-matched HIV-exposed children and determine the effect of dietary energy and protein supplementation on LBM and protein kinetics in the HIV-infected group.I.\\tHYPOTHESIS Despite an adequate dietary protein intake, HIV-infected children have a lower LBM due to a deficit in the availability of endogenous protein to support LBM synthesis.  This decreased protein availability is secondary to a chronic upregulation of protein catabolism relative to intake.  We further propose that this condition can be ameliorated by dietary supplementation with more energy and protein.II.\\tSPECIFIC AIMMeasure body composition and protein kinetics in prepubertal HIV-infected children versus age and gender matched HIV-exposed children and determine the effect of dietary energy and protein supplementation on protein kinetics in the HIV-infected group.III.\\tBACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Although loss of lean body mass (LBM) is a common finding in adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), it is not a common finding in asymptomatic HIV-infected adults, that is, those without secondary infections (1,2). Studies in such patients, like those in patients with other stressed states, show faster rates of whole body protein turnover than observed in healthy controls. Dietary protein intake and net rates of protein catabolism, however, are similar to those observed in healthy controls. Hence, protein balance is maintained in HIV-infected adults (1,2). In contrast, growth failure secondary to low rates of lean tissue deposition is common in infants and young children with HIV infection, including those without secondary infections (3-5). There is evidence that both linear and ponderal growth are affected (6-8) and in a retrospective study, Arpadi reported that 42% of perinatally HIV-infected children had a growth velocity below the fifth percentile, indicating growth failure (8). Thus, it appears that the virus, per se, induces a disturbance in protein metabolism that leads to reduced protein deposition in infants and young children but not in adults. Indeed there is evidence that levels of HIV RNA are greater in children with poor growth compared with infected children with normal rates of growth, suggesting that suppression of HIV replication should have positive effects on growth. This has been confirmed by recent reports showing that HAART has positive effects on both weight and linear growth velocity, especially among younger children (9-11). What is not clear is whether improved growth is associated with improved net protein synthesis, hence increased LBM. Whereas, Miller et al reported an 11.5% improvement in arm muscle circumference in a cohort of ~9 year old HIV-infected children who were on HAART for 7-10 months (9), Verweel et al reported that body mass index (BMI) did not increase in all children treated with HAART (11). It only improved in children who were undernourished at baseline prior to starting HAART. On the other hand, one study of 197 children aged 2 to 17 years randomly assigned to ritonavir containing regimens reported a worsening of growth in those children who achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA levels at and below 400 copies/mL after 48 to 96 weeks (12). To resolve these conflicting findings it is necessary to measure in vivo protein kinetics in HIV-infected children.SignificanceIn HIV-infected children growth failure is an important predictor of a poor prognosis.  It is well established that growth failure often precedes secondary infections in HIV-infected infants and children (e.g. 3-5) indicating that inadequate protein deposition may be an early manifestation of infection by the virus.  However, little is known about protein metabolism of HIV-infected infants and young children.  Based on our preliminary findings in asymptomatic HIV-infected children (13), we propose that infection by the virus elicits an acute phase response.  Hence, more protein and energy has to be channeled towards sustaining increased turnover of acute phase proteins in the face of reduced dietary energy and inefficient utilization of dietary protein.  Based on these data we propose that a reduction of viral load by HAART plus a diet supplemented with extra energy and protein should abolish the lower net protein synthesis of HIV-infected children, thereby increasing growth and LBM.\",\n",

       " 'Project Summary: The purpose of this project is to determine whether or notthere are qualitative and quantitative differences in fecal Salmonella colonizationbetween symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs in the Pacific Northwest region ofthe USA. Salmonellosis is one of the most important food-borne diseases andcauses substantial medical and economic burden worldwide. Although food isthe main source of Salmonella infection in humans, non-food Salmonella sourcescan include pets (particularly dogs and cats), as well as their foods, snacks, andsupplements. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis in humans oranimals is gastrointestinal disease and Salmonella bacteria are shed via infectedfeces. Dogs in particular often do not show signs of salmonellosis when infected.Recent studies show that 14% to 25% of asymptomatic household dogs canshed Salmonella into their environment. Also a recent outbreak of humansalmonellosis, primarily in toddlers, was linked to commercial dry dog food.There remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding factors associated withdifferences in Salmonella carriage between dogs with or without gastrointestinaldisease.

       " 'Project SummaryThe objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and types of Salmonella in fecal samples from bothsymptomatic and asymptomatic animals brought to veterinary clinics. Salmonella can be present in manydifferent environments, including water, soil, insects, feces, wild and farm raised animals, raw foods, surfacesand animal feeds. Salmonellosis causes gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. Symptoms in peopleinclude nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever and headache. Animals may also show signs ofgastrointestinal disease, although they may harbor Salmonella bacteria without showing signs of clinicaldisease. Since 1999, a number of human salmonellosis outbreaks have been correlated with ingestion ofSalmonella-contaminated animal feeds in Canada and the United States. What remains generally unknown isthe effect that Salmonella contaminated feeds has on the health of pets. How frequently do cases ofSalmonellosis occur in pets, and how frequently do they develop a carrier state, where do they harbor thebacteria but fail to exhibit clinical signs of disease? In addition, the various serotypes of Salmonella involved inpet disease have not been adequately characterized. In order to gain further insight into the prevalence ofSalmonella infected animals following feed contamination, the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) isseeking proposals that will provide information on the prevalence of Salmonella in fecal samples obtained fromdiarrheic and non-diarrheic pets seeking veterinary care.. Laboratories will participate in a multi-center studyand CVM will coordinate methods among the participants. Sampling protocols and culture methods will bestandardized throughout the participating laboratories. Patient fecal samples will be cultured for Salmonellafrom using well established and validated methods. Serotyping methods will also be standardized among theparticipants. These isolates will be submitted to CVM upon completion of the study. A minimum of 100symptomatic and 100 asymptomatic cases will be examined during a 12 month period.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Carotid artery stenosis is a well-known cause of atheroembolic stroke. Stroke prevention in these patients has been the focus of intense investigation. Cognitive impairment is a more insidious but poorly understood outcome in patients with  asymptomatic  carotid stenosis who have not suffered a stroke. Cognitive function describes how a person produces and controls mental processes such as thinking, learning, and problem solving. It is an important outcome measure that affects patient well-being and their ability to live independent productive lies. It is well-known that cognitive impairment coexists in patients with stroke from carotid stenosis. However, isolated cognitive deficits in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have not been looked for, and have therefore not been reported in any detail.  Asymptomatic carotid stenosis affects 2-12% of people. With 23.4 million veterans in the country, at least 1 million (4.3%) have asymptomatic carotid stenosis and are at risk for cognitive impairment. A subset analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Study found cognitive decline in 34% of 32 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In this proposal, we will define the extent of initial and progressive cognitive impairment in veterans with carotid stenosis who are currently labeled as  asymptomatic  in the absence of a focal neurologic deficit (stroke, transient ischemic attack). Programs to prevent, postpone, or mitigate cognitive impairment in patients with carotid stenosis will depend on the identification of mediators for cognitive impairment. Microembolic brain injury and cerebral hypoperfusion have been associated with cognitive impairment in elderly individuals. Therefore plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion are likely mediators of impaired cognition in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. As part of this proposal, we will identify the biological mechanisms by which carotid stenosis could result in cognitive impairment.  The goal of this proposal is to perform a systematic, adequately powered study to measure the magnitude of cognitive impairment in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, its impact on quality of life, and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Information from this study will define an unsuspected morbidity of carotid stenosis and identify subsets of patients at risk for cognitive impairment. It will form the foundation for future studies on prevention, pre-emptive treatment, or rehabilitation of patients with carotid stenosis. It will also improve the selection of patients with carotid stenosis to decrease unnecessary revascularization procedures.  Specific Aim 1 will assess if patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis differ in cognitive function compared to age-matched controls without carotid stenosis but with similar vascular risk profiles. We hypothesize that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis 50% who survive stroke free for 2 years; the change in overall and domain-specific cognitive function will be significantly different compared to those without stenosis. The study will recruit 284 subjects and will detect a clinically significant difference in cognitive score with 90% power. We will use a novel battery of cognitive tests specifically developed to address the unique issues relating to carotid stenosis. Specific Aim 2 will define plaque-morphometric, biologic, and hemodynamic characteristics that correlate with cognitive impairment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We hypothesize that carotid plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum pro-inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion could each mediate cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up period. We will implement a novel clinical 3D B-mode ultrasound imaging technique developed to obtain reliable serial plaque measurements. Specific Aim 3 will measure the impact of cognitive impairment on quality of life. We hypothesize that at 2 years, regardless of plaque features, cognitive impairment will correlate with a reduction in health-related quality of life measures.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Carotid artery plaques are known to cause stroke. Cognitive impairment is an insidious but poorly under- stood problem in patients with carotid plaques. Cognitive function describes how we perform mental processes such as thinking, learning and problem solving. Asymptomatic carotid plaques may affect 1 million veterans who may be at risk for cognitive impairment. In this study, we will uncover the extent of cognitive impairment in veterans with carotid stenosis who are currently labeled  asymptomatic . Programs to prevent or mitigate cog- nitive impairment will depend on identifying the mechanisms by which this occurs. We will use sophisticated 3D imaging techniques developed by our group to measure the structure and composition of plaques, number of particles breaking off from them, blood levels of chemicals that could disrupt them, and blood flow restriction to the brain from them. This will help identify patients at risk for cognitive impairment who may benefit from pre- ventative measures and improve selection of patients to decrease unnecessary surgical procedures.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to pursue research in the area of sleep and wake performance, with a particular focus on individuals who have irregular sleep-wake schedule - night shift workers. My training has focused on the interaction of symptoms of excessive sleepiness and /or insomnia observed in night shift workers and their brain functioning during wakefulness. My immediate scientific goals are to apply my knowledge of electrophysiological methods of brain function assessment of attention and memory in symptomatic and asymptomatic night workers. I have proposed an intensive period of training focused on the investigation of possible predictors of excessive sleepiness and insomnia in night workers that might be triggered by circadian phase change with clinically significant symptoms leading to neuronal deficits in attention and memory. Training will be organized in main three modules each providing specific instruction and consultations regarding topics related to the proposed research plan and long term in my career goal of becoming an independent investigator. Environment: Henry Ford Health Systems is a well established research facility and would be an ideal training site for this award. Proven mentorship, strong within and across departmental collaboration and an institution with a dedicated research commitment combine to provide a setting well suited for the career development of a young scientist. Research: According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics more then 7 million Americans work on a night or rotating-shift basis. Epidemiological studies show a subset (10%) of night and rotating-shift workers have clinically significant symptoms of excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia. These sleep-wake disturbances may be due to differences in circadian adaptation to the shift work schedule. In addition, the impaired wakefulness during night work and the commute home can be seriously impaired due to impact of these symptoms on attention and memory brain function. However, to date, these impairments were never measured in night workers with symptoms of excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia, and we do not know what degree of impairment is present. Our research plan addresses that gap and we propose 1) determine whether the symptomatic night shift workers have an advanced phase of their circadian pacemaker relative to asymptomatic night workers; 2) determine what components of physiologic maladaptation to night work are associated with neurophysiological correlates of impairment in attention and memory processes; 3) whether excessive sleepiness is associated with deficit of brain activity related to memory process in night shift workers, and 4) whether insomnia is impacting the attentional processes in the brain of night workers.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epidemiological studies have shown that 10% of night and rotating-shift workers experience clinically significant excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia symptoms. Importantly, excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia in shift workers may cause the impairments in attention and memory function that severely impact work and non-work performance. The reason for these negative consequences might be a failure of circadian pacemaker to adapt to a shift-work schedule. Yet, the impact of circadian maladaptation on the neurophysiology of memory and attention processes has not been systematically investigated. This proposal addresses this significant gap in knowledge, by using a simultaneous examination of circadian phase, sleep, sleepiness, and neurophysiological event-related potential measures of memory and attention in night workers with excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia and will compared these measures obtained from asymptomatic night shift workers.',\n",
       " 'The sap-sucking insects including aphids cause significant economic loss to U.S. agriculture. Current control methods rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides for reducing aphid populations, which can also inadvertently harm beneficial insects such as honey bees. Management of the soybean aphid has been particularly problematic and costly since the introduction of this invasive pest into the U.S. in 2000. We will test a novel toxin for toxicity against the soybean aphid, with the long term goal of developing transgenic soybean that are resistant to the soybean aphid. Objectives: For this project we will construct modified toxins specifically designed for toxicity against the soybean aphid. We will then assess the specificity of the modified toxins to ensure that they target the soybean aphid without detriment to non-target insects. Approach: Five sets of modified toxins will be generated and tested for stability, aphid gut binding, and toxicity against the soybean aphid. Toxins with the greatest toxicity against the soybean aphid will then be tested for toxicity against other species of aphid, and against pestiferous and beneficial insects found in soybean, including the honey bee. This project may provide for an environmentally benign alternative to classical chemical insecticides for management of pestiferous aphids that would benefit both U.S. agriculture and the environment.',\n",

       " 'HIV protease inhibitors, such as, ritonavir and saquinavir, are substrates for xenobiotic efflux pumps, e.g., P-glycoprotein and Mrp2 and thus penetrate the blood-brain barrier poorly. To map the extracellular and intracellular signals that regulate these transporters, we use 1) pharmacological tools, 2) intact brain capillaries from rats and mice (including transgenics and knockouts), 2) fluorescent substrates, 3) confocal imaging to measure transport function, 4) Western blotting to measure transporter expression, and 5) brain perfusion in rats and mice to validate signaling-based changes in blood-brain barrier transporter function in vivo. Our recent studies have focused on identifying signals that modify pump activity in the barrier. These in vitro and in vivo experiments with animal models suggest two specific strategies for modifying this barrier to improve drug delivery, but also potentially important complications of polypharmacy related to xenobiotic upregulation of efflux transporter expression. One strategy for improving CNS delivery of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates involves activating protein kinase C (PKC) isoform beta1 or sphingolipid signaling at the blood-brain barrier. This causes a rapid and reversible reduction in basal P-glycoprotein transport activity in isolated brain capillaries and in intact rats. In vivo, such signaling increases brain uptake of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates. Thus, targeting signals that regulate basal activity of this transporter increases delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain, including HIV protease inhibitors. &#8232;A second strategy to improve HIV drug delivery to the CNS involves use of an innovative chemical strategy with the P-gp substrate and anti-viral agent, abacavir, in conjunction with a traceless tether. Dimeric prodrugs of abacavir were designed to have two functions: inhibit P-gp efflux at the BBB and revert to monomeric therapeutic within cellular reducing environments. The prodrug dimers are potent P-gp inhibitors in cell culture and in a brain capillary model of the BBB. Significantly, these agents demonstrate anti-HIV activity in two T-cell-based HIV assays, a result that is linked to cellular reversion of the prodrug to abacavir. This strategy represents a platform technology that may be applied to other therapies with limited brain penetration due to P-glycoprotein.Complications related to polypharmacy and xenobiotic exposure involve increased expression of multiple blood-brain barrier drug efflux pumps after exposure to therapeutic drugs, dietary constituents and environmental toxicants that specifically activate nuclear receptors, including, Pregnane-X Receptor (PXR), Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) or Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). Once activated by ligand, these receptors translocate to the nucleus, targeting the promoter regions of genes coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters. In brain capillaries in vitro, exposure to ligands for PXR, CAR or AhR more than doubles expression and transport activity of P-glycoprotein, Mrp2 and BCRP. in vivo, such signaling reduces brain uptake of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates. These findings raise the possibility of further tightening of the blood-brain barrier to many therapeutic drugs in patients undergoing polypharmacy or exposed to environmental pollutants, e.g., dioxins.',\n",

       " \"A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiol's antidepressant efficacy in perimenopausal depression.  Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop depression during the perimenopause.  In these studies, first we examine the effects of estradiol withdrawal and the recent onset of hypogonadism on mood symptoms in asymptomatic premenopausal women.  Second, we investigate what factors influence the development of depression during estradiol withdrawal.  We administered a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for two to three months to 72 regular cycling, asymptomatic, healthy, premenopausal women.  Only three women (< 5.0% of the sample) reported clinically significant symptoms of depression and in only one woman were depressive symptoms sustained for two weeks.  In contrast to the relative absence of depressive symptoms in these women, we did observe the significant appearance of hot flushes, disturbed sleep, and diminished libido.  Virtually an identical pattern of symptom expression was observed in our previous study of asymptomatic healthy men who underwent a similar hormone manipulation.  Thus, in otherwise healthy women (and men), the induction of neither hypogonadism nor hot flushes (with an accompanying sleep disturbance) uniformly precipitates depressive symptoms.  In related ongoing studies, we also investigate two factors that could impact the appearance of depression during estradiol withdrawal - age and a previous episode of depression.  We evaluate the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in older postmenopausal women with and those without a past perimenopausal depression.  Estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with a past perimenopausal depression, but not in those without such a history.  In women with a past depression during the perimenopause, estradiol withdrawal is associated with a significant increase in depressive symptoms compared with those who were maintained on estradiol therapy.  Additionally, no significant depressive symptoms emerged in the women lacking a history of depression.  Recruitment of only a few more controls are needed to complete this study.  Our data are consistent with those from epidemiologic studies showing that, for a subgroup of women, the endocrine events of the late menopause transition represents and important trigger for mood destabilization and the onset of depression.  Both the markers of this risk and the mechanisms underlying estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms remain to be identified.  The results of the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) have deterred many women from using estrogen therapy, and many women and their physicians are concerned about the long-term risks of estrogen therapy.  In a previous study, we demonstrated the antidepressant effects of the short-term administration of estradiol in women with perimenopausal depression.  We now are examining the effects on mood and behavior of two compounds that for many women represent alternatives to traditional estrogen therapy.  Specifically, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and phytoestrogens (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds) have become available and are reported to display both tissue-specific profiles of estrogen agonist and antagonist actions and differential affinities from estradiol for the two forms of estrogen receptor.  Preliminary results demonstrate that after eight weeks of either estradiol or raloxifene (but not a plant-based phytoestrogen compound), mood rating scores were significantly decreased compared with baseline scores and significantly lower than scores in women receiving placebo.  Recruitment for this treatment trial is approximately 80% complete and we hope to finish this protocol this year.  Equal efficacy to that of estradiol would provide an alternative therapeutic option with a more acceptable profile of long-term side effects.  As phytoestrogens are already commonly recommended, and widely used for the treatment of mood symptoms, further clarification of their mood effects has significant public health implications.  In future studies, we intend to investigate the behavioral relevance of estrogen receptor beta as well as a potential caged form of estradiol with brain-specific estradiol actions in humans.  Specifically, we will examine the antidepressant/anxiolytic efficacy of selective estrogen receptor beta agonists (when available for human use) in women with perimenopausal depression.An additional strategy that we have employed is the use of the longitudinal design to identify predictors of the onset of depression during the menopause transition.  The study now includes over 100 women, forty of whom have completed between five and 10 years of longitudinal follow-up during the menopause transition.  This will be the first high-density, longitudinal study examining both menstrual cycle phase characteristics and reproductive hormones in women as they transition through the menopause.In a previous study, we demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of the adrenal androgen DHEA in men and women with midlife-onset depression; however, clinical response was not accompanied by a specific change in adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone levels.  Recently, we observed that the neurosteroid androsterone increases after DHEA treatment (with women achieving higher levels than men) and is associated with clinical response.  The response pattern of androsterone differed in men and women and showed an inverted U-shaped curve, suggesting that an optimal level of androsterone is associated with antidepressant response.  Other neurosteroids measured (in collaboration with Dr. Christine Marx at Duke University) showed no association with DHEAs antidepressant response.  These data, (along with our prior demonstration of the physiologic relevance of androsterone secretion in male sexual function), emphasize the potential importance of this neurosteroid in human behavior.Karyotypically, normal, 46XX spontaneous (i.e., idiopathic) primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition in which ovarian failure occurs at an early age.  We identified that a lifetime prevalence of depression in adult women with POI is significantly greater than that reported in both the general population, and in gynecologic or general medical outpatient settings.  Additionally, first episodes of major depression preceded the date of POI diagnosis in over 70% of women.  However, episodes of depression occurred after evidence of ovarian failure began in the majority of women (i.e., after the onset of menstrual cycle irregularity).  Thus, we have demonstrated that depressions occur after the onset of MCI potentially secondary to the events related to this premature menopause transition (at a time similar to the onsets of depression in the normally-timed menopause transition).  We now have initiated a collaboration with Drs. Maya Lodish and Laurence Nelson within NICHHD to prospectively evaluate mood changes and the prevalence of depressive illness in adolescent girls who present with POI.  A better understanding of the nature of this association could identify candidate genes and physiological processes that may inform both our understanding of the relationship between depression and POI, as well as the association between depression and the menopause transition in the normally-timed menopause.\",\n",

       " 'MyositisMany autoimmune conditions are believed to result from chronic inflammation as a consequence of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in susceptible individuals. One common feature in some autoimmune diseases is the decrease in terminal galactosylation of the constant region N-glycan of the total plasma immunoglobulin. To determine whether a similar pattern is characteristic for the autoimmune disorder myositis, we analyzed the antibody subclass specific glycosylation in patients with myositis, their asymptomatic siblings, and healthy unrelated age- and sex-matched controls. The antibody subclass specific glycosylation was determined from the LC-MS analyses of the IgG glycopeptides generated by trypsin digestion of the antibody heavy chain. The glycosylation profiles of the IgG subclasses were determined relative to the abundance of the monogalactosylated core-fucosylated glycoform, G1F. We found elevated amounts of glycoforms lacking terminal galactose in myositis patients. Pairwise statistical analyses reveals that galactosylation is statistically different between the myositis patients and control groups.  Furthermore, the trend analysis for glycosylation indicates a pattern of decreasing galactosylation in the order: controls>siblings>myositis patients, suggesting the existence of a genetic, immune-related predisposition in the group of asymptomatic siblings that can be detected before the onset of clinical symptoms at the level of plasma proteins.  The IgG glycosylation pattern of one set of monozygotic twins, where one twin was asymptomatic and one twin was symptomatic, was also studied.  Our IgG glycosylation data may indicate that different serologic phenotypes may be associated with discordance of monozygotic twins and that there is an environmental factor in the progression of the disease as well as genetic factors.Sjogrens Syndrome.Structural and functional studies of the autoantigens are necessary to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of Sjogrens syndrome.

As an extension of this work, the interactions of LaSSB with RNA are currently under investigation. Collectively, these data provide useful information regarding the tertiary structures of LaSSB and has been used to help generate a structural model of the full-length LaSSB.',\n",
       " 'HTLV-1 was the first defined human pathogenic retrovirus. Seroepidemiologic and molecular genetic data firmly establish an association between HTLV-1 infection and a chronic, slowly progressive neurologic condition previously termed tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) that often emanated from clusters in tropical areas, including the Caribbean Basin, India, and Africa. A similar condition described in Japan is referred to as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). It is now recognized that HAM and TSP (HAM/TSP) are identical clinical conditions. The clinical course in HAM/TSP is predominantly that of a slowly progressive spastic paraparesis associated with bladder and bowel dysfunction. Importantly, this disease shares many clinical similarities with the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, many HAM/TSP patients have been diagnosed as MS up until the time that HTLV-I has been dected in sera or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).The histopathological changes in HAM/TSP, again similar to MS, include a considerable mononuclear cell inflammation with lymphocytic perivascular cuffing, capillary proliferation, demyelination, and a reactive astrocytosis. Demyelination and axonal damage affects the spinal cord most severely, predominantly in the lateral columns. However, the entire neuroaxis may be involved including optic nerves, cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem and peripheral nerves.Regulation of HTLV-1 production is mediated by non-structural gene products, particularly through the transcriptional activator known as HTLV-1 Tax. This transactivating protein induces the expression of host cellular genes, especially those that play crucial roles in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as interleukin-2 and its receptor. This in turn likely contributes to a state of ongoing lymphocyte activation seen in this disease. HTLV-1 has minimal direct cytopathic effect and the observed tissue destruction in HAM/TSP is thought to be a consequence of immune mediated pathological events. In addition, clinically manifest disease attributable to HTLV-1 such as HAM/TSP is seen in only a small percentage of infected individuals. This suggests the contribution of several susceptibility factors including genetic and immunological makeup of infected individuals in addition to viral characteristics.Antibodies to HTLV-1 can be detected in sera and CSF of infected patients by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) or Western Blotting techniques are used to confirm positive HTLV-1 results. The World Health Organization accepts for diagnosis a positive HTLV-1 ELISA followed by a Western Blot with antibody banding with p19 or p24 encoded protein in combination with banding for rgp21 or rgp46env protein. Individuals with a positive HTLV-I ELISA but a Western Blot that only partially fulfills the above criteria are considered to be sero-indeterminate. Whether this incomplete banding pattern in sero-indeterminate individuals is due to defective retrovirus or due to low virus load has been a subject of our investigation. We are investigating novel techniques for the detection of antibodies to different HTLV-I proteins in patients infected with HTLV-I and seroindeterminates.  We have demonstrated HTLV-I specific antibody banding patterns that can differentiate between HTLV-I infected individuals with and without neurological disease.A major emphasis within the Viral Immunology Section is to examine clinical, virological and immunological parameters in individuals with HAM/TSP, asymptomatic sero-positive individuals, family members at risk for acquiring HTLV-1, and individuals with HTLV-1 indeterminate serology. Specific focus is on the effect of viral load, presumed route of infection and genetic makeup on immunological function. Whole blood, lymphocytes, and plasma/serum obtained from individuals with HAM/TSP, asymptomatic sero-positive individuals, sero-indeterminate individuals, as well as, healthy controls. We will assess virological and immunological parameters using these samples. In HTLV-1 seropositive individuals these studies will be extended to cerebrospinal fluid.Basic laboratory investigations have demonstrated the importance of the cytokine IL-15 in the life and death of lymphocytes and for its role in autoimmune disorders such as HAM/TSP. IL-15 is pivotally involved in the survival of CD8+ memory T-cells including self-directed cells and we have shown that in HAM/TSP, IL-15 is essential for the survival of HLA class I restricted virus antigen-specific effector and memory CD8+ T-cells. These CD8+ antigen-specific CTL are thought to play a major role in the immunopathogenesis of HAM/TSP since they have been localized in brain and spinal cord sections of patients. As IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that stimulates the production of TNF&#945;, IL-1&#946; and other inflammatory cytokines, the release of IL-15 induced by HTLV-I tax in patients with HAM/TSP may underlie the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.The mode of action of IL-15 and its receptor subunits IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha are coordinately stimulated and expressed following HTLV-I tax stimulation. We have shown that this trans-stimulation can be virtually totally inhibited for NK and CD8+ T-cells by the addition of a humanized monoclonal antibody, Hu MiK-&#946;1, that blocks IL-15 binding to the IL-2/IL15R&#946; receptor subunit expressed on these cells.Collaborative research by the Viral Immunology Section, NINDS and the Metabolism Branch, NCI have initiated a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of HAM/TSP using Hu MiK-beta-1 that blocks the action of IL-15. We have assessed the effects of intravenously administered Hu-MiK-beta-1 on the cellular immune response in patients with HAM/TSP, with particular focus on virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells. Secondary outcomes to be measured are clinical responses, including toxicity, and the effect on CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells. As IL-15 over expression has been demonstrated in patients in a wide variety of autoimmune disorders including, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, the successful application of Hu MiK-beta-1 in HAM/TSP has significant and broad therapeutic implications.The HTLV-I induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) is considered a key event in the leukemogenesis leading to ATLL, but less has been demonstrated regarding the role of NF&#954;B activation in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Herein we show evidence of both canonical and non-canonical NF&#954;B activation in short-term cultures of PBMC from subjects with HAM/TSP, in the absence of exogenous stimulation. We show that the NFkB activation in HAM/TSP PBMC can be reversed by small molecule inhibitors. Inhibition of NFkB activation in HAM/TSP PBMC resulted in the inhibition of STAT5 activation and spontaneous lymphoproliferation, two ex vivo correlates of the immune activation associated with HAM/TSP. These results indicate that NFkB activation plays a critical upstream role in the immune activation associated with HAM/TSP, and identify the NFkB pathway as a potential target for immune modulation in HAM/TSP.A number of laboratory studies have demonstrated that virus infection can activate a variety of CNS-specific cells including microglia and astrocytes. The VIS has investigated the effects of both a human retrovirus (HTLV-I) and herpesvirus (HHV-6) in these cell populations, in vitro. We are  translating these observations to the patient by imaging studies that can detect activated microglia/macrophage and reactive astrocytes. In collaboration with the Molecular Imaging Branch, NIMH, we have begun to investigate the expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in the CNS that has been show be a marker of activated microglia/macrophage.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a known cause of stroke in about 80,000 patients every year in US. In addition it is suspected to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. However, despite being such a common health problem, the prevalence of this disease is unclear. Also, the degree of association of ICAD with cognitive impairment and dementia remains unstudied. We plan to study the prevalence of ICAD in US elderly population and also determine its association with cognitive impairment and dementia. Aims: The broad objective of our proposed project is to conduct an ancillary study in the subsample of 2000 subjects who are undergoing MRI in ARIC-NCS. Aims are 1) to estimate the prevalence of ICAD in the ARIC participant aged 70-89 years and 2) to determine whether ICAD is associated with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. Design/Methods: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities is an NHBLI funded cardiovascular cohort that has followed about 16,000 subjects, aged 45-64 for last 25 years. Now, ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), funded by NHLBI, will perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2000 of the remaining 7000 subjects. Neurocognitive testing will be performed as part of ARIC-NCS and the sample of 2000 subjects selected for MRI will include subjects with dementia (n=358), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n=761), and normal participants (n=878). We plan to acquire magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies on these 2000 subjects at the same time MRI images are being acquired for ARIC-NCS. We will measure luminal stenosis, a standard clinical parameter for ICAS, using MRA. In addition, we will measure intracranial vessel wall thickness, using a novel high-resolution MRI sequence. Vessel wall thickness may detect atherosclerotic changes without any significant stenosis and may be a better measure of atherosclerotic disease burden. In addition, compared to luminal stenosis, vessel wall thickness may also be more strongly associated with cognitive impairment or dementia. We will use two different definitions of ICAD to determine prevalence 1. luminal narrowing of >50%, and 2. vessel wall thickness of >0.6-mm. Implications. The study is based on new data that suggests asymptomatic ICAD is associated with cognitive impairment among elderly persons in the general population. Furthermore, asymptomatic ICAD may be associated with cognitive impairment in the absence of cerebral infarctions on MRI due to chronic hypoperfusion in the elderly population. This will also be the first study to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAD in the US elderly population and its impact upon cognitive impairment.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies over the last decade have dramatically changed our understanding of the early natural history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by demonstrating convincingly that RA-related autoantibodies are elevated in asymptomatic individuals for at least several years prior to the development of clinically apparent signs and symptoms of RA. This autoantibody positive but asymptomatic phase is then followed shortly before the onset of clinically apparent signs and symptoms of arthritis by the development of increased systemic inflammation that is manifest by elevated serum/plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Because of these findings, we now have a general conceptual framework of how the disease develops in its earliest phases. However, despite these gains in knowledge, the initial citrullinated epitopes to which pathogenic B and T cells respond are unknown. This knowledge is critical to our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms that underlie disease development as well as the future design of tolerance-based therapies. We have established a unique cohort of individuals under the umbrella of the Studies of the Etiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) who are at the highest definable risk for the future development of RA. Two Co-Investigators in this project application, Drs. Robinson and Buckner, have developed novel approaches to identify and characterize antigen-specific B and T cell responses to citrullinated and other RA-related autoantigens. To advance our understanding of the autoimmune response at the earliest time points in the development of RA, we propose to utilize these techniques in high-risk SERA participants and pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim #1. Identify the innate and adaptive immune response modifications that are causally associated with the break in tolerance to citrullinated autoantigens and progression to active disease; Specific Aim #2. Use novel single-B-cell expression techniques to identify the RA-related autoantigens that are targeted in the initial preclinical phases of disease development; and Specific Aim #3. Determine what peptide autoantigens are recognized by T cells in the initial phases of the loss of self tolerance in the preclinical period of disease development.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it utilizes a unique cohort of subjects and biomaterials and is focused on a strategy that will improve our understanding of the mechanisms whereby individuals develop preclinical autoimmunity and then subsequently transition to clinically apparent rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Unique antigens and epitopes recognized by subjects who are progressing to the development of RA will be defined. The proposed research will address questions directly bearing on the programmatic goals of NIAID that are focused on supporting research into the causes, treatment and prevention of autoimmune diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcal meningitis is a devastating disease in AIDS patients, with a mortality of 12% in the U.S. and 20-90% in resource-limited settings. Cryptococcosis can exist as a latent infection with an average cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) positivity of 21 days prior to development of symptoms, although some studies suggest evidence of latency for years. Recent research found an 8-18% prevalence of CrAg+ in asymptomatic AIDS patients in Africa and Asia with CD4-/<100 cells/mm3. CrAg+ predicted development of symptomatic cryptococcal disease and subsequent mortality, while fluconazole use was associated with increased survival. Asymptomatic CrAg+ has not been characterized in HIV-infected patients in the United States. This study seeks to determine the prevalence and natural history of asymptomatic CrAg+ in the United States. For further investigation of latent cryptococcal disease and immune-mediated risks of reactivation, development of a murine model of latent cryptococcal disease is proposed. Aims: 1) To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic CrAg among AIDS patients with CD4< 200 cells/mm3 in the United States, and to characterize the risk factors associated with the development of symptomatic cryptococcal disease. 2) To develop a murine model of latent cryptococcal infection, and use CrAg titers to monitor disease activity and quantify disease burden with immunosuppression and subsequent restoration of immune function. Research Design: In Aim 1, stored plasma samples of asymptomatic HIV patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 enrolled in U.S.-based ACTG studies will be screened for CrAg to determine prevalence. To assess risk factors for developing disease, subjects positive for baseline CrAg who did, and did not develop cryptococcal disease will be compared with respect with serial CrAg titers, CD4, VL, timing of antiretroviral therapy, and fluconazole use. In Aim 2, a murine model of latent cryptococcal infection will be developed by inhalationally infecting mice with C. neoformans to establish persistent, low level infection. Latently infected mice will be immunosuppressed with anti-CD4 antibody, with one group of mice subjected to persistent CD4-depletion, while the other group will have immunosuppression lifted. Both groups will be followed for reactivation, persistence or spontaneous resolution of disease. Serial quantitative CrAg lateral flow assays (LFAs) will be followed in whole blood, serum and urine, and correlated with fungal burden in mouse organs. Implications: This study will provide the first description of asymptomatic cryptococcal disease inthe United States, and is a necessary step towards developing appropriate treatment guidelines for CrAg+ HIV/AIDS patients in the United States. Development of a murine model that allows for manipulation of immune status will contribute to a greater understanding of the disease in AIDS patients, and provide a valuable tool for further study of pathogenesis and disease management.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research from Asia and Africa suggests that screening for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in asymptomatic, severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected individuals, and treatment of those who are CrAg positive, can prevent development of a devastating fungal infection. We propose using stored serum samples from AIDS Clinical Trial Group studies to determine the prevalence, geographic distribution, and risk factors for progression of asymptomatic cryptococcal infection in the United States. We also propose developing a mouse model of latent cryptococcal infection to better understand the immune triggers of developing active disease, and to better characterize CrAg-titers with fungal disease burden. These studies will lead to further understanding of latent cryptococcal disease, and inform the optimal management of asymptomatic disease in the United States and globally.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV-1 surface glycoprotein Env (gp120/gp41) mediates viral entry through a series of coordinated structural changes initiated when CD4 interacts with gp120. Ultimately, the gp41 ectodomain folds into a compact trimer-of-hairpins that brings the viral and cellular membranes into the close proximity required for efficient membrane fusion. These conformational transitions have been delineated, in part, through the use of C- peptide and 5-Helix inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions of gp41 and block trimer-of-hairpins formation. Our previous work has described the physical basis behind C-peptide and 5-Helix inhibition and quantitatively modeled the relationship between inhibitory potency and fusion kinetics. The experiments outlined in this application explore the structure and dynamics of Env in its native and intermediate conformations. The research will address three fundamental questions regarding the mechanism of viral membrane fusion: How does CD4 binding to gp120 trigger formation of the prehairpin intermediate state? What is the structure of Env in this intermediate conformation? What aspects of gp41 folding from the prehairpin state drive the fusion of viral and cellular membranes? Owing to the unstable nature of Env in its native and intermediate states, these questions are often difficult to address using standard experimental techniques, such as scanning mutagenesis, that require stable proteins in long lived conformations. Our basic approach will be to generate new inhibitors that target the HR1 and HR2 regions, and dissect the mechanism of resistance to them. This strategy takes advantage of the power of natural selection to generate well-behaved mutant Env variants with interesting structural or dynamic properties. The specific aims are: 1) to explore the structure and exposure of the HR1 region using novel inhibitors engineered to overcome standard C-peptide resistance profiles; 2) to probe the structure and exposure of the HR2 region using multivalent inhibitors, and to dissect the mechanisms of resistance to these agents; and 3) to explore the energetic requirements of Env- mediated membrane fusion, and to examine the structure of mutant Env variants trapped in intermediate conformations. Our findings will provide new insights into the dynamic properties of the gp120/gp41 complex critical to the viral entry mechanism and will aide the development of new viral entry inhibitors and HIV-1 vaccines.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long term objective of the proposed research is to increase our knowledge about the structure, function and inhibition of the HIV-1 Env, the major protein on the viral surface. These experiments involve inhibitor design and characterization in order to explore how Env promotes HIV-1 entry through viral membrane fusion. Analyzing of the mechanisms of viral escape from these inhibitors will provide insights into the energetics and kinetics of Env structural changes that promote membrane fusion. The research will ultimately facilitate therapeutic and vaccine development for the treatment and prevention of AIDS.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Diverticulosis is a common and expensive condition in the United States. In 2004 there were 815,000 hospitalizations for diverticular disease, 3.3 million ambulatory care visits, and 2.4 million prescriptions written. With an aging population allthese figures will increase. Despite the considerable economic and medical burden from diverticular disease, information on the etiology is largely nonexistent because asymptomatic diverticulosis has never been adequately studied. The proposed study builds upon a cross sectional study in which, contrary to expectation, the investigators found that a high-fiber diet was associated with increased (rather than a decreased) prevalence odds of diverticulosis with a significant dose response and a stronger effect among individuals with more frequent diverticula. The study will test the hypothesis that gut microbes are responsible for an altered immune response and a state of chronic inflammation that could lead to the development of diverticulosis possibly through alterations in the integrity of the colonic wall or altered motilit. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the prevalence and demographic characteristics of asymptomatic diverticulosis among a group of individuals undergoing first time screening colonoscopy. (2) To determine dietary and lifestyle risk factors for diverticulosis. (3) To evaluat the association between the adherent microbial flora and diverticulosis. (4) To assess local inflammation and immune activation in the colonic mucosa to support an inflammatory etiology for diverticulosis. To conduct the study, detailed dietary and lifestyle information will be colleced on 900 study subjects who undergo complete screening colonoscopy with careful investigation for diverticulosis. Sigmoid colon biopsies will be used to evaluate adherent bacterial organisms using pyrosequencing. Local inflammation and immune activation in tissue will be measured by immunohistochemistry. Blood will be stored for future studies of genes that might predispose to diverticular disease. The study is designed to correct the shortcomings of prior research on asymptomatic diverticulosis and test biological hypotheses about etiology. The proposed study is a first step in understanding the cause of diverticulosis with the hope of preventing the disease and its complications  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to describe the prevalence and demographic characteristics of asymptomatic diverticulosis among a group of individuals undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy. The findings from this study will provide important insights into the role of diet, the gut microbiota and inflammation in the development of diverticulosis. The study could lead to eventual interventions to lower the prevalence of disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a spectrum of involvement in those with the FMR1 premutation that ranges from developmental problems in childhood and psychopathology in adulthood to neurodegeneration in aging; the latter includes the Fragile X-associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) that we have identified with our Australian collaborators. However, some individuals with the premutation have no overt clinical involvement, whereas others experience mild or severe deficits in childhood, adulthood or aging. Typically, the developmental problems are thought to be related to FMRP deficits, whereas the aging problems to RNA toxicity secondary to elevated FMR1-mRNA. We will assess the influence of specific domains of molecular/cellular dysfunction, including mitochondrial dysfunction, inter-tissue (lymphocyte-fibroblast) mosaicism, occult methylation, and increases of disease-associated antisense FMR1 (ASFM1) isoforms on the nature and degree of the clinical phenotypes in both children and adults who are carriers of premutation alleles. Specific clinical outcome measures will be used that can document mild to severe involvement in the neurocognitive, motor and psychiatric realms. We will assess 189 patients (10 to 30 years) including 63 carriers who are affected, 63 who have normal development (asymptomatic) and 63 normal controls matched on age and sex to define the relationship between the severity of premutation developmental problems, including cognitive, motor and social deficits, and the presence of specific molecular abnormalities (Specific Aim 1). We will extend these studies to characterize the nature and severity of molecular dysfunction in adults with the premutation who have psychiatric and/or neurological dysfunction but do not meet clinical criteria for FXTAS (Specific Aim 2); we will recruit 201 patients (30 to 65y), divided between carriers who are affected with neurological or psychiatric problems, asymptomatic carriers, and controls matched for age and sex. We will determine whether the spectrum of clinical involvement in premutation adults is paralleled by severity of molecular dysregulation or whether the molecular features of FXTAS are distinct, and whether early biomarkers can be identified to use in future treatment endeavors. Lastly we will utilize sensitive neuroimaging techniques (diffusion tensor imaging; DTI) to assess involvement in adults with the premutation to determine the degree of concordance between the loss of integrity of fiber tracts in white matter and the severity of the mitochondrial dysfunction in adul carriers with psychiatric and/or neurological problems compared to unaffected carriers and controls (Specific Aim 3). This work will continue to include the Australia team, who will carry ou the occult methylation studies on blood and fibroblasts for all patients seen at both sites, in addition to limited recruitment for Aims 1 and 2. Our studies will provide biomarkers of early involvement and lay the basis for treatments such as mitochondrial based interventions, targeted treatment for low FMRP, or medications that block RNA toxicity early on.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The premutation is common in the general population (approximately 1 in 130-810) and it can cause developmental problems including intellectual deficits and autism spectrum disorders, adult psychiatric disorders and neurological problems in aging including the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). However, most individuals with the premutation are unaffected and we do not know why some individuals with the premutation suffer from these problems and others do not. This grant will assess detailed molecular mechanisms including mitochondrial abnormalities, mosaicism between the lymphocytes and fibroblasts, the antisense FMR1 (ASFMR1) splice isoforms and occult methylation to determine the molecular markers of premutation clinical involvement.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 protease is the target of the most effective anti-viral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. All these drugs derive from successful structure-based design studies. The enzyme cleaves the viral gag-pol polyprotein at least ten unique sites and is essential for maturation of the virion and thus the spread of the virus. Therefore, it has been a prime target for drug design research. Unfortunately the medical efficacy of the current drugs is proving to be short lived, as viable mutant variants of HIV-1 protease confer drug resistance. Drug resistance is a subtle change in the balance of recognition events, between the relative affinity of the enzyme to bind inhibitors and its ability to bind and cleave substrates. Since HIV-1 protease binds substrates and inhibitors at the same active site, a change that alters inhibitor binding also alters substrate binding. We previously developed a structural rationale that explains how HIV protease recognizes its substrates and how drug resistant mutations occur within the active site of HIV protease, while still maintaining substrate recognition. HIV protease recognizes a conserved asymmetric shape that the substrates adopt, the  substrate envelope . This led us to the realization that most active-site drug-resistant mutations within HIV protease occur where the inhibitors protrude beyond the consensus substrate envelope and contact the protease. Those protease residues are prime positions for drug resistance to occur, as they are more important for inhibitor binding than for substrate binding. In this proposal we elucidate the interdependence of drug-induced co-evolution of HIV-1 protease and within Gag and its impact on protease inhibitor drug resistance and investigate how to extend the substrate envelope to other systems.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-1 protease is the target of the most effective anti-viral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Unfortunately the medical efficacy of the current drugs is proving to be short lived, as viable mutant variants of HIV-1 protease confer drug resistance.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The limitations of HIV-1 therapeutics, which include viral drug resistance and off-target effects, provide the impetus for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of new anti-HIV-1 drugs. Previous in vitro data found that the combination of two clinically approved drugs, decitabine and gemcitabine, reduced HIV-1 infectivity by 73% at concentrations that had minimal antiviral activity when used individually. Decreased infectivity coincided with a significant increase in mutant frequency and a shift in the HIV-1 mutant spectra by combining a nucleoside analog that forms non-canonical base pairs with certain ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors. Increased mutational load is implicated as the primary antiviral mechanism for inhibiting the generation of infectious progeny virus from provirus, and support a model in which increased mutation frequency decreases infectivity through lethal mutagenesis. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that error-prone viral replication may induce  error catastrophe  or extinction in vivo due to an accumulation of deleterious mutations. Strategies designed to drive viruses to error catastrophe have been applied to HIV-1 and a number of RNA viruses however for the most part they have not been evaluated in vivo for their ability to effectively control HIV replication. Here, we propose to use a novel humanized mouse model to investigate 1) the ability of decitabine and gemcitabine to control viral replication in vivo, and 2) the ability of the decitabine/gemcitabine drug combination to control HIV replication in vivo by elevating the viral mutational load.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TB diagnosis in India relies on clinical symptoms, microscopic examination of smears made directly from sputum and/or chest X-rays (CXR). The immune dysfunction caused by HIV-infection alters clinical and radiological presentation of TB, and microbiological confirmation of TB is problematic since HIV+TB+ patients have increased frequency of smear-negative (SN) TB and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Despite being totally treatable with the existing drugs, the poorer performance of insensitive diagnostic tests in HIV+ patients leads to significant under-diagnosis of TB in the very population where TB progression is rapid and often fatal. A simple, rapid test to identify smear-positive (SP) and SN symptomatic or asymptomatic TB in HIV+ patients would have significant impact on TB-related morbidity and mortality. Five immunogenic proteins of M. tuberculosis that are potential candidates for devising a simple diagnostic test for TB in HIV+ patients have been identified. These are MS, MPT51, PPE55, ESAT6 and CFP10. Antibodies (Abs) to these antigens have been demonstrated at all levels of immune-suppression, regardless of pulmonary manifestations and site of TB in HIV+TB+ patients, and are also detectable in sera of asymptomatic HIV+ patients who progressed to symptomatic TB in the subsequent 2-6 months. Absence of Abs to these antigens in retrospective sera from CD4 T cell-matched HIV+ patients who did not eventually develop TB suggests that in HIV+ patients, these Ab responses signal active TB whether or not clinical symptoms of TB are present and before the bacterial burden reaches the threshold of detection by direct microscopy. In the current studies we propose to evaluate the potential of these Abs to identify SN and SP symptomatic/asymptomatic HIV+TB+ patients in prospective studies and to map their dominant epitopes that are recognized by Abs in Indian patients. For this, we will recruit a cohort of ~200 ART-na¿ve HIV+ patients and investigate them for TB using direct microscopy as well as with decontaminated/concentrated sputum smears, cultures on solid media and NAAT evaluation of sputum, blood and urine (Aim 1); evaluate the presence of Abs to recombinant purified MS, MPT51, ESAT6, CFP10 and PPE55 in serum specimens from the recruited individuals and correlate the presence of Abs with bacteriological confirmation of TB (Aim 2) and identify the immunodominant epitopes on the 5 antigens recognized by serum Abs from Indian patients on peptide microarrays to define peptides that can be used to devise a peptide-based rapid test for TB in Indian HIV+ patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is the development of antiviral drug combinations composed of FDA-approved host- targeted compounds as therapeutic regimens with enhanced potency, broad-spectrum activity and high barriers to resistance. Resistance to antiviral therapy is a major public health concern, often undermining the clinical utility of whole classes of drugs targeting specific viral components. In the cases of rapidly mutating viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C, and influenza, resistance to antivirals can occur rapidly as the result of treatment with single agents. We propose a new avenue for drug development that may yield a new generation of drugs with high barriers to resistance and broad spectrum activity by repurposing approved drugs that simultaneously target multiple host factors and pathways that are critical for virus replication. By focusing on FDA-approved drugs, this approach could dramatically reduce the timeline and costs of bringing a product to market. More importantly, because these drugs target known and well validated host factors, and because their safety and efficacy have been demonstrated through human use, the risk associated with drug development is also significantly reduced. We screened a library of approved drugs and successfully identified >40 host-directed drug hits which had modest and differential activity against influenza and yellow fever viruses as single agents, but whose potency was enhanced 5- to 20-fold when used in combination with other host-targeted compounds or with direct-acting antivirals. In this R21/33, we propose to advance a lead compound (ADS-324, an antifolate) against a panel of Category A, B, and C viruses, and to identify and develop a combination regimen of approved HTDs with broad spectrum antiviral activity with the following four aims: Aim 1 (R21). Determine the spectrum of activity for ADS-324 against Category A, B, and C viruses in cell based assays. Milestone: Demonstration that ADS-324 has activity as a single agent (EC50 5-fold below clinically achievable concentrations of each drug) against more than one virus. Aim 3 (R33). Determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters of lead candidates in the appropriate model species. Milestone: Determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-24, AUC0-¿, t 1/2) for up to four drugs in two species, and the estimation of human equivalent doses (AUC0-24). Aim 4 (R33). Demonstration of in vivo efficacy against Category A, B, or C viruses and nomination of lead candidates for development. Milestone: Demonstration of in vivo efficacy (>50% survival at clinically relevant doses) against at least one virus. At the successful completion of this proposal, we will be poised to submit an Investigational New Drug Application for a host-targeted antiviral regimen composed of approved drugs that act synergistically against multiple viruses.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is the development of drug combinations composed of FDA-approved drugs in a regimen that will be active against viruses of particular importance to national security and public health (such as dengue and influenza). Resistance to antiviral therapy is a major public health concern, often undermining the clinical utility of whole classes of drugs targeting specific viral components. By repurposing approved drugs that target human cellular pathways that are critical for virus replication, we propose a new avenue for drug development to yield drugs with demonstrated safety, enhanced potency, broad-spectrum activity and the reduced probability for the development of resistance.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT Respiratory tract pathogens such as the human parainfluenza virus and SARS coronavirus effectivelyinfect human airways by exploiting a diverse set of cell surface glycans and glycoprotein receptorsencountered in airway cell types. In case of adeno-associated viruses (AAV), serotypes 1, 5, 6 and morerecently, AAV9 have been shown to efficiently transduce airways in vitro and in vivo, albeit with strikingspecies-specific and serotype-specific differences. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate molecular andcellular determinants of airway tropism in AAV serotypes. To achieve such, we have devised a comprehensiveapproach that hinges on molecular manipulation of AAV capsids through mutagenesis, biochemical reagentsfor identification of glycans and co-receptors that mediate AAV airway cell entry and relevant in vitro models ofthe human respiratory tract. The strategies described herein will (a) define AAV capsid structural elements atthe amino acid level that determine airway tropism, and (b) enable identification of cell surface componentsincluding glycans and integrin subunits that dictate AAV tropism for different airway cell types. The proposedstudies will help provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms underlying AAV airway cell entry as wellas provide insight into species-specific differences in AAV airway tropism. If successful, this knowledge mayfacilitate improvements in AAV vectors as well as in the design of preclinical/clinical studies focused on genetherapy of airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of death and disability in cancer patients. The incidence of VTE in these patients in further increased by the administration of anti-neoplastic drugs, such as the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin, as well as combination therapies. However, the mechanisms of VTE in cancer patients are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether an association exists between tissue factor (TF) activity in circulating microparticles (MPs) and venous thrombosis in patients with pancreatic or colon cancer, and in tumor-bearing mice. MPs are small (<1 micron) membrane vesicles that are released from activated or apoptotic cells. Our general hypothesis is that chemotherapy drugs increase the release of TF-positive MPs from both tumor cells and host cells into the circulation, and that an increase in the level of these MPs is associated with an increase in the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic VTE in pancreatic and colon cancer patients, and an increase in thrombus size in tumor-bearing mice. The proposal is divided into two aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the effect of treatment of tumor-bearing mice with chemotherapeutic drugs on circulating TF-positive MPs derived from tumor cells and different host cells as well as their role in a model of venous thrombosis. We will measure the levels of TF activity in isolated MPs in tumor-bearing mice treated with either gemcitabine or gemcitabine and cisplatin. We will use a series of novel mouse lines to distinguish between TF-positive MPs derived from i/ tumor versus host cells, and ii/ different host cells (monocytes, endothelial cells and platelets). These include HCV mice, which express human TF in the absence of mouse TF, and mice with various cell type-specific deletions of the TF gene generated using the Cre-loxP technology. Finally, we will selectively analyze the role of either tumor cell- derived or host cell-derived TF-positive MPs in a model of venous thrombosis. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if there is an association between TF activity in circulating MPs and VTE in patients with advanced pancreatic and colon cancer treated with anti-neoplastic drugs in a multi-center prospective observational study. Blood samples will be obtained from patients before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis will be assessed using compression ultrasound before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs. We will measure levels of TF activity in isolated MPs and determine if this is associated with asymptomatic and/or symptomatic VTE. We will also measure whole blood TF activity, cellular origin of the TF-positive MPs and coagulation activation markers (thrombin anti thrombin complexes and D- dimer). The results of this study will determine the role of TF-positive MPs in venous thrombosis associated with cancer and chemotherapy. TF activity in isolated MPs may be a useful biomarker that can be used either alone or as an adjunctive biomarker in clinical predictive models of thrombotic risk in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Public Health Relevance: Development of blood clots in veins or venous thrombosis is a leading cause of death and disability among cancer patients. Both the underlying cancer and the chemotherapy used to treat it are known to increase the risk of venous thrombosis. It is the goal of this research proposal to study the mechanism by which cancer and treatment of cancer with anti-cancer drugs lead to development of blood clots. We will also determine if increase in an important clotting protein in the blood (called tissue factor) is associated with development of blood clots in cancer patients, and if so, whether it could be used to predict which cancer patients are at increased risk for blood clots. This is of enormous importance as physicians will be able to institute measures to prevent thrombosis in high-risk patients and improve clinical outcomes.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a devastating and incurable clonal plasma cell (PC) malignancy that is preceded by a highly prevalent asymptomatic premalignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or a less prevalent, more advanced stage called smoldering MM (SMM). Both groups of patients have a significantly increased, life-long risk of progression to MM, however, a diagnosis of MM is not made until there are overt clinical manifestations of serious end-organ damage. As a result, MGUS and SMM patients with evolving disease do not receive treatment until they become symptomatic. Although a number of useful prognostic factors have been identified, the field still lacks an accurate and sensitive biomarker(s) that identifies MGUS and SMM patients who have begun to progress before displaying symptoms. In this regard, it has been known for over 75 years that cancer cells undergo a distinct metabolic adaptation by which glucose uptake is considerably enhanced to meet the augmented cellular demand for nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids created by increased rates of cellular proliferation accompanying tumor progression. This metabolic alteration, termed aerobic glycolysis (AG), is known to be promoted by mitochondrial defects, oncogenic signals, microenvironmental hypoxia, and abnormal expression of certain metabolic enzymes. AG also underlies the clinical utility of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in the management of various tumors. The nearly universal characteristic of preferential glycolytic metabolism by cancer cells suggests this alteration provides a selective proliferative advantage and may potentially be a requisite step in tumor progression. In this regard, MM cells are known to display increased glucose uptake based on positive FDG-PET scans in these patients. Despite the FDG avidity of MM cells, the role of altered cellular metabolism as an essential factor in MGUS and SMM progression to MM remains uninvestigated. On this basis, as well as our preliminary data, we hypothesize that MGUS and SMM PC metabolic reprogramming resulting in activation of the AG pathway is the common, unifying event underlying genetically diverse MGUS and SMM progression to MM. Here, we propose that assessment of AG at the PC level will provide a novel, sensitive, and accurate means of early detection of MGUS and SMM transition to MM. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine the metabolic phenotype of abnormal PCs in MGUS, SMM, and MM patients, and identify key AG genes underlying this metabolic alteration. The identified AG genes will also serve as candidate biomarkers for accurately identifying MGUS and SMM patients who are progressing to MM but are still asymptomatic. Aim 2 will define the biological role of these key AG genes in MM cell proliferation. The overall impact of our study derives from the mechanistic insights that will be gained and the discovery of novel biomarkers. Furthermore, demonstration that certain AG genes are required for disease progression and/or pathogenesis would also foster development of novel targeted therapies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a typically fatal plasma cell (PC) cancer that is preceded by two asymptomatic precursor conditions, i.e., monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering MM (SMM). We hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming, which causes a significant increase in glucose consumption, plays an essential role in disease progression to MM. We aim to identify the specific genetic changes that cause metabolic reprogramming thereby identifying important therapeutic targets as well as biomarkers that would identify patients with MGUS and SMM before they evolve into symptomatic MM.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and fatal clonal plasma cell (PC) malignancy. All MM cases are preceded by a highly prevalent asymptomatic premalignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or a less prevalent, more advanced stage called smoldering MM (SMM). MGUS and SMM patients exhibit significant risk of progression to MM, with rates estimated at 1% and 10% per year, respectively. Importantly, a diagnosis of MM depends on overt clinical manifestations of serious end-organ damage. Therefore, treatment is not initiated before evolving MGUS and SMM patients reach an advanced disease stage. Because currently identified risk factors lack sufficient accuracy to justify treatment initiation of asymptomatic patients using agents with considerable toxicities, our specific goal is to identify accurate biomarkers that detect the earliest stage of PC malignant transformation such that MGUS and SMM patients in the process of progressing can be identified prior to the onset of serious end-organ damage. A number of useful prognostic factors have been identified, however, the field still lacks an accurate and sensitive biomarker(s) that identifies MGUS and SMM patients who, in spite of being asymptomatic, have begun to progress. Although MGUS and SMM PCs harbor genetic lesions typical of MM, they can somewhat surprisingly remain remarkably stable for years suggesting the presence of a currently unknown barrier(s) to further expansion. Because these initial lesions are insufficient to cause symptomatic disease, the critical question that needs to be answered is what are the specific biological/genetic changes that occur to permit the abnormal PC clone to overcome this barrier(s) in patients who progress to MM? In this regard, it is notable that common themes observed during malignant progression include metabolic changes, remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (ME), and increased cell proliferation, all of which have also been identified in MM. In preliminary studies, we have obtained provocative evidence that the transmembrane CD147 molecule, also known as EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] inducer), may be playing an important biological role in MM PCs and that its expression may become induced during disease progression. Thus, we hypothesize that CD147 is not only an exceptionally promising biomarker of MGUS and SMM progression, but that malignant PCs require its expression for growth and survival as well as for its ability to modify the ME in a manner that fosters further disease progression. Two aims are proposed. Aim 1 will evaluate the ability of PC CD147 expression to identify asymptomatic MGUS and SMM patients with evolving disease. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of CD147 in MM cell proliferation and modification of the tumor ME. The overall impact of our study derives from the mechanistic insights that will be gained and the discovery of an important role for CD147 in progression to MM. Furthermore, demonstration that this molecule is required for disease progression and/or pathogenesis would also foster development of novel targeted therapies to CD147.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) are asymptomatic precursor conditions to the typically fatal plasma cell (PC) cancer, multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, we lack accurate biomarkers able to detect patients in the process of progressing prior to serious end-organ damage. Our data suggest that the CD147 molecule is an exceptionally promising biomarker of MGUS and SMM progression and we hypothesize that it is essential for malignant PC proliferation and modification of the tumor microenvironment. Our overall goal is to identify MGUS and SMM patients with evolving disease and define therapeutic targets that might uniquely eliminate the evolving abnormal PCs.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central goal of this K24 renewal application is to further my development as a clinical investigator, while enhancing my opportunities and skills in the mentorship of fellows and promising young faculty interested in careers in clinical research. Patient-oriented clinical research has been the cornerstone of my medical career. My main research focus has been the investigation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). In recent years, my research has concentrated on the non-classical manifestations of PHPT, and the studies in this thematically related K24 program are focused in this area. My research goal is to continue to develop this program. All three themes of this renewal application were highlighted by the 3rd International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94:335-9, 2009) as key areas for future investigation. The themes and Specific Aims (SA's) of this research are: Theme 1. Vitamin D deficiency in PHPT: SA1a. To compare biochemical and skeletal features of PHPT patients with and without co-existing vitamin D deficiency. SA1b. To investigate the early effects of vitamin D repletion in PHPT on static and dynamic histomorphometric parameters of bone remodeling (by quadruple labeled bone biopsy). Theme 2. Cardiovascular manifestations of PHPT: SA2a. To determine whether or not abnormalities in cardiovascular structure or function in patients with asymptomatic PHPT are reversible after parathyroidectomy. SA2b. To investigate the hypothesis that some of the cardiovascular manifestations of PHPT are due to low vitamin D levels, rather than elevated calcium and PTH levels, by comparing left ventricular mass index and carotid intima medial thickness in PHPT patients with and without vitamin D deficiency. Theme 3. Neurocognitive manifestations of PHPT SA3a. To further investigate neurocognitive abnormalities in PHPT by assessing site-specific changes in brain metabolism after parathyroidectomy using the innovative technique of functional MRI. SA3b. To determine whether the neuropsychological abnormalities seen in hypercalcemic PHPT are present in normocalcemic PHPT. Although outside of the closely-knit theme of the K24, there are other ongoing and future opportunities for mentored research (i.e. theme: obesity/bariatric surgery and the skeleton: 3 mentored studies ongoing). Importantly, the proposal will provide many opportunities to mentor junior investigators. I have had success as a mentor, with 16 current or past trainees, 10 of whom have been mentored under the current K24 award. Seven of the 10 remain in academic medicine. Of those I have mentored, 3 currently hold and 1 recently completed NIH K23 Awards, 3 completed Masters in POR (2 under my mentorship) and 2 received Endocrine Fellows Foundations grants. One mentee, who has worked with me since her fellowship began, was awarded a NIH stimulus grant. As Co-Director of our NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and Director of the 4th yr Endocrinology Elective in the medical school, I have ongoing access to medical students, residents, Endocrine Fellows and junior faculty who are interested in my research. There has also been interest in my research from trainees in other disciplines (current cardiology fellow Iwata), enhancing my potential to add interdisciplinary perspectives to POR in metabolic bone diseases that should enhance our field. My mentorship goals for this K24 are both to have the opportunity to mentor, and to further develop my mentorship skills. New directions for mentorship will include: 1. I will develop a new program to educate mentors in the Department of Medicine; creating a curriculum for developing mentoring skills and convening mentors to share and refine best practices. 2. I will expand my mentoring in new directions: a) outside of my research area as a Mentor in the Department of Medicine Faculty Development Program; and b) within my research area but outside of Columbia in online mentorship programs (ASBMR Mentor Matching program and The Endocrine Society's Mentor Exchange). I will develop new mentorship skills, learning to transmit critical information electronically ratherthan in person and by example. 3. Coursework at Columbia on: mentoring, FDA regulated research and research with minors will sharpen and expand my tools for mentoring. The environment at Columbia is outstanding, with a large and supportive Endocrine Division, an excellent NIH funded Clinical Research Center and CTSA, which offers my mentees the opportunity for didactic enrichment in POR through their Master of Science in POR program (Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and CTSA). Both the Department of Medicine and the GCRC have made substantial commitments toward my development as a clinical investigator. The initial K24 funding period allowed me to reduce my clinical, administrative and teaching loads in order to devote more time to clinical research and to training and mentoring junior faculty and fellows. This award remains an ideal mechanism to allow me to achieve my dual goals: continued productivity in the clinical investigation of parathyroid disease, with protected time for mentoring fellows and junior colleagues interested in patient oriented clinical research as a career path. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this K24 renewal application is designed to address several areas identified as key directions for future research by the 2008 International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism. These include vitamin D deficiency in primary hyperparathyroidism, as well as the cardiovascular and neurocognitive manifestations of the disease. The new knowledge that will be generated by the work described in this proposal will have its own intrinsic value and clinical applicability. It will also serve as a vehicle for m to continue mentoring young clinicians interested in a career in patient-oriented research (POR). In addition to providing mentoring, this award will allow me to further develop my mentoring skills through new initiatives in and outside of my area of research, both locally (at Columbia) and nationally/internationally. I am fully committed to overseeing the best possible outcome in both the Mentorship and Research arenas. ! !\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacillus subtilis produces a wide array of extracellular metabolites that can inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi or modify their behavior to attenuate the production of antibacterial products by potentially dangerous neighbors. We here propose to use the new technique of imaging mass spectrometry and classical analytical chemistry to systematically identify the extracellular metabolome of B. subtilis, with a focus on characterizing the interactive metabolome that is induced by other bacterial species. We will investigate the role these compounds play in two distinct outcomes of the interaction of B. subtilis with other species. The first is an impasse, in which B. subtilis forms closely abutting colonies with other species that produce a variety of antibacterial compounds (such as P. aeruginosa). The second, more frequent behavior is contact-dependent predation, in which B. subtilis moves towards, invades and destroys neighboring colonies, leading to death of the prey species and expanding the territory of the B. subtilis colony. These reproducible behaviors are conserved in different undomesticated B. subtilis strains. We will determine if these behaviors depend on the interactive metabolome and investigate the effects individual compounds have on target cell viability and behavior. We will further investigate the genetic requirements for interspecies interactions to identify stress responses, developmental and biosynthetic pathways that contribute to these distinct outcomes and we will use fluorescence microscopy to visualize the cellular consequences of interspecies interactions. These studies will illuminate the mechanistic basis for interspecies interactions and identify secondary metabolites that affect viability or behavior of other species that represent potential new antibacterial drugs.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacteria produce many extracellular metabolites that mediate their interaction with other species, many of which have antibacterial and antifungal activities. We will here elucidate the chemical, genetic and cellular mechanisms by which these molecules allow Bacillus subtilis to interact with other bacterial species, producing outcomes ranging from coexistence to the invasion and destruction of neighboring colonies. Interspecies interactions are critical in medicine and the metabolites that facilitate destruction of other species represent promising new pharmaceutical leads.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: I am a board-certified neurologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and instructor at the Harvard Medical School (HMS). My research interest lies in the translation of discoveries in human genetics to clinical application n multiple sclerosis (MS) and related neuroimmunological and neurodegerative disorders. Leveraging my PhD thesis work in basic cellular and molecular neuroscience and ongoing post- doctoral training in statistical genetics and translational genomics, I will gain proficiency in th following new research areas through mentored project and structured educational activities: (1) lead a team of researchers and direct patient-oriented research; (2) design and implement studies that incorporate innovative biomarkers and neuroimaging outcomes of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration; (3) devise clinically relevant applications of genetic information such as a genetic risk score for biomarker selection, disease prediction, and risk stratification; (4) pursue translational genetics research using Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-derived data and bioinformatics tools. These new translational research skills will enable me to achieve the career goal of making the transition to an independent investigator. Environment: I have assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentor (Dr. Philip De Jager, an expert in incorporating human genomics techniques into the study of complex neurologic disorders) and co-mentors (Dr. Issac Kohane, an expert in bioinformatics and predictive modeling; Dr. Daniel Reich, an expert in MS neuroimaging), consultants and senior faculty members with complementary expertise who will guide my research and promote my career development. This multi-layered mentor structure is embedded in a highly collaborative environment of unparalleled intellectual caliber that is part of Harvard-affiliated institutions: BWH Department o Neurology, BWH Institute of Neurosciences, Broad Institute, and HMS. Dr. Martin Samuels (Chairman of BWH Department of Neurology) and Dr. David Silbersweig (Chairman of BWH Institute of Neurosciences) are both supportive of my career plan. Research: An important challenge facing clinical care in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the lack of robust predictive tools toguide individualized risk stratification for subjects at risk of developing MS. The overall goal ofthe study is to test the efficacy of an algorithm that integrates existing genetic and environmental data into a single, individual estimate of the risk of developing MS. We hypothesize that such an algorithm can provide MS risk stratification for asymptomatic subjects at risk of MS, such as family members or patients with Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS: asymptomatic individuals with incidental findings of MS-like lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). First, we will calculate our MS genetic and environmental risk score (GERSMS) in a cohort of 500 neurologically asymptomatic first-degree relatives of MS patients and assess whether the 100 subjects with the highest GERSMS exhibit an MS-associated peripheral blood biomarker profile when compared to the 100 subjects with the lowest GERSMS. Second, we will assess the efficacy of GERSMS in predicting the presence of MRI-defined MS lesions and other MS-related MRI outcomes in neurologically asymptomatic first- degree relatives and assess whether the 50 subjects with the highest GERSMS have more MS-like lesions, smaller brain volume or greater diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes that suggest loss of white matter tract integrity when compared to the 50 subjects with the lowest GERSMS. Finally, we will assess the efficacy of GERSMS in predicting conversion to clinical MS in RIS patients identified from existing EMR-derived data. Innovation: This proposal is innovative since it applies a novel approach to address an understudied question: how do we identify asymptomatic individuals who are at the highest risk of developing multiple sclerosis? The proposed study leverages a recently published, robust analytic method that is further enhanced by the most up-to-date genetic information and validated epidemiological data to produce a novel single estimate of risk for MS. We will test the method in two unique sample collections of asymptomatic subjects: (a) asymptomatic first-degree relatives of MS patients, (b) RIS patients identified from one of the largest EMR systems Specifically, we will assess the efficacy of this method in the selection of cutting-edge blood biomarkers and sensitive neuroimaging measures. If validated, our approach has the potential to make the study of asymptomatic subjects feasible by identifying the subset of subjects at the highest risk of transitioning from health to MS, thus opening up a whole new area of investigation in MS that could ultimately shed light on the design of strategies to prevent the onset of MS. Finally, the utilization of an EMR-derived virtualcohort for translational genetics research opens a rich resource for tackling challenging translational research questions that cannot be easily addressed by traditional cohort studies: (1) unforeseen co-morbidities of neurological disorders, (2) unrecognized neurological complications of medications on the market, particularly new immune modulating biologic agents. These future studies are not restricted to the field of MS and create future areas to develop independent investigation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes a substantial socioeconomic burden to society in addition to its effects on affected individuals who are often in the prime of their life and their families. A central challene facing MS is the lack of reliable tools to provide individual estimates of the risk of developing M for family members of MS patients, who are at increased risk for the disease. The proposed project develops and tests an individualized risk prediction tool that incorporates the latest knowledge in MS genetics, environmental exposures, and blood tests to identify those individuals who are at the highest risk for developing the disease.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to conduct a Stage II randomized trial to test Culturally Informed & Flexible Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CIFFTA) a treatment developed as part of a Stage I treatment development effort and showing very promising preliminary findings. Drug use rate are highest among Hispanic middle school youth and to date there are few if any treatments that have been proven effective with substance abusing Hispanic adolescents. Further treatment for Hispanic youth and families is complicated by the fact that these families often differ from mainstream drug users in values, beliefs and behaviors that can directly impact engagement, retention, and efficacy/effectiveness of drug treatment. Our efforts to develop and fully test a more powerful treatment that can address these issues began with a Stage 1 study that: 1) led to the development of a flexible manual that allows treatment tailoring to the unique family characteristics, 2) showed highly promising feasibility and acceptability indicators (Santisteban and Mena, in press) and 3) showed highly promising preliminary outcomes on both drug use and family-level hypothesized mediators (Santisteban et al., unpublished manuscript). This application proposes a Stage II randomized trial with 220 Hispanic youngsters' ages 14-17 meeting criteria for drug abuse and their families. The study will test the treatment's efficacy compared to a control condition, in impacting drug use, risky sexual behavior, and hypothesized mechanisms (family functioning and therapeutic alliance) of change, in a larger and more rigorous trial. The study also includes a test of the dose-response relationship and exploration of moderators of treatment outcome. This application responds to a Program Announcement (PA-07-111) that outlines as areas of interest  ...women, minorities, families, couples, specific cultural groups, adolescents...  The Stage II trial focuses on a treatment designed to boost the treatment effects by building in a flexible tailoring process to better address the specific needs of: 1) adolescents, 2) minorities and a special cultural group - Hispanics, via a treatment that works with 3) couples and families.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Should this line of research continue to be successful, it will contribute to the field: 1) a highly innovative and effective treatment for Hispanic drug abusing adolescents, 2) a better understanding of the mechanisms of change in family therapy with drug abusing adolescents, and 3) a framework for flexible and tailored treatment that can be used to better address the unique needs of other special populations.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal application is designed to obtain extended follow-up of a unique cohort of asymptomatic patients with rotator cuff tears from which substantial and encouraging data has been obtained. The broad aim of this proposed research is to determine the natural history of rotator cuff disease and factors important in the clinical deterioration of tears. This information is fundamental for determining proper surgical indications and optimizing outcome. These patients offer a rare opportunity to determine risk factors for tear degeneration over time as treatment intervention has not been necessitated by the onset of symptoms. Additionally, we aim to establish two new follow-up cohorts which should provide important adjunctive information regarding partial-thickness tear progression and the relationship between the development of fatty degeneration with tear size, tear location and the development of new pain. Our specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To obtain long-term follow-up of full-thickness tears to evaluate factors important for tear deterioration and symptom development. A population of 89 individuals identified as having unilateral asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have been followed for minimum period of 2 yrs. Important information regarding alteration in glenohumeral kinematics, rate of tear enlargement, changes in muscle strength and fatty degeneration are anticipated with longer-term follow-up. These patients will be followed with yearly radiographic, outcome, ultrasound and clinical exams for up to 10 yrs. Specific Aim 2: To determine the probability of partial tear progression to full-thickness tears. For 48 individuals previously enrolled with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears and 50 new recruitment patients, yearly high resolution ultrasound exams will be performed to determine the risk of complete tear degeneration. Specific Aim 3: To longitudinally follow full-thickness tears to determine factors important to the development of fatty degeneration. Fatty degeneration of rotator cuff muscles is an irreversible phenomenon associated with decreased healing and outcome following surgical treatment. Ultrasound will be employed to assess what factors such as tear location, tear size, and patient age may be important in the development of fatty degeneration. To date, data from the enrolled population of patients with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have provided a wealth of new information regarding the natural history of cuff disease and important factors for surgical indications. The proposed project could be an important next step in understanding the natural history of cuff disease and innovative in that a unique study population of asymptomatic tears and partial tears will be longitudinally followed during an extended time of symptom development and tear deterioration with fatty degeneration. With the proposed study design, risk factors for irreversible tendon or muscle deterioration will be studied. This knowledge is important to determine the necessity for early operative treatment.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A painful shoulder from rotator cuff disease is one of the most common problems afflicting the musculoskeletal system with research showing that up to 50% of individuals over the age of 70yo may have tears. Understanding what factors are important in the development of pain, loss of strength, and enlargement of the tear is critically important to formulate strategies for treatment. This study proposes to follow individuals with rotator cuff tears and no pain over an extended period of time to determine the risk of new pain and deterioration of the cuff.',\n",

       " \"Despite the near-universal skepticism that initially greeted Folkman¿s presentation of his idea that anti-angiogenesis would be an effective approach to cancer chemotherapy, this concept has now become widely accepted and forms a basis not only for cancer therapy, but also for therapy of a broad range of non-neoplastic disorders that Folkman summarizes under the term 'angiogenesis-dependent diseases'. Currently approved therapies, directed against the central bodily chemical involved in angiogenesis, VEGF, are useful, but not entirely safe or effective. We propose to develop new anti-VEGF agents through discovery by powerful phage display methods, and to apply these new agents as a forthcoming generation of safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors. Our specific aims are: (i) to discover and develop new anti-angiogenic peptidomimetic compounds targeting the VEGF receptor family, and (ii) to design and test new agents for therapeutic control of retinal angiogenesis. These agents would both bind selectively to pathological new blood vessels and block or destroy them, without affecting normal blood vessels. Our goal is to understand and inhibit pathological angiogenesis in the neural retina of experimental mouse models of human blindness-causing diseases.\",\n",
       " 'Venous thrombombolism (VTE) is a leading cause of death and disability in cancer patients. The incidence ofVTE in these patients in further increased by the administration of anti-neoplastic drugs, such as thechemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin, as well as combination therapies. However, the mechanismsof VTE in cancer patients are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether anassociation exists between tissue factor (TF) activity in circulating microparticles (MPs) and venous thrombosisin patients with pancreatic or colon cancer, and in tumor-bearing mice. MPs are small (<1 micron) membranevesicles that are released from activated or apoptotic cells. Our general hypothesis is that chemotherapydrugs increase the release of TF-positive MPs from both tumor cells and host cells into the circulation, and thatan increase in the level of these MPs is associated with an increase in the incidence of asymptomatic andsymptomatic VTE in pancreatic and colon cancer patients, and an increase in thrombus size in tumor-bearingmice. The proposal is divided into two aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the effect of treatment oftumor-bearing mice with chemotherapeutic drugs on circulating TF-positive MPs derived from tumor cells anddifferent host cells as well as their role in a model of venous thrombosis. We will measure the levels of TFactivity in isolated MPs in tumor-bearing mice treated with either gemcitabine or gemcitabine and cisplatin. Wewill use a series of novel mouse lines to distinguish between TF-positive MPs derived from i/ tumor versus hostcells, and ii/ different host cells (monocytes, endothelial cells and platelets). These include HCV mice, whichexpress human TF in the absence of mouse TF, and mice with various cell type-specific deletions of the TFgene generated using the Cre-loxP technology. Finally, we will selectively analyze the role of either tumor cell-derived or host cell-derived TF-positive MPs in a model of venous thrombosis. In Specific Aim 2 we willdetermine if there is an association between TF activity in circulating MPs and VTE in patients with advancedpancreatic and colon cancer treated with anti-neoplastic drugs in a multi-center prospective observationalstudy. Blood samples will be obtained from patients before and after treatment with anti-neoplastic drugs.Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis will be assessed using compression ultrasound before and after treatmentwith anti-neoplastic drugs. We will measure levels of TF activity in isolated MPs and determine if this isassociated with asymptomatic and/or symptomatic VTE. We will also measure whole blood TF activity, cellularorigin of the TF-positive MPs and coagulation activation markers (thrombin anti thrombin complexes and D-dimer). The results of this study will determine the role of TF-positive MPs in venous thrombosis associatedwith cancer and chemotherapy. TF activity in isolated MPs may be a useful biomarker that can be used eitheralone or as an adjunctive biomarker in clinical predictive models of thrombotic risk in cancer patientsundergoing chemotherapy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diverticular disease is one of the most prevalent disorders in western societies, and complications of diverticulosis are frequent, costly and often recurrent. Identification of individuals at high risk for these complications is of great clinical importance. However, few risk factors have been identified, and no preventative strategies exist short of segmental colectomy. The role of human intestinal microbiota in disease is increasingly being recognized. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology now enable cost-effective, large-scale profiling of the intestinal microbiota, and provide a new quantitative tool for the study of gastrointestinal disorders. The intestinal microbiota represent an attractive target for study in diverticular disease since they can be sampled, providing the basis for a potential biomarkers and preventative interventions. The overall goal of this proposal is to profile the intestinal microbiota in both patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and those with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. We plan to use a combination of state-of-the-art molecular and novel metagenomic approaches, and to determine whether quantitative analysis of the intestinal microbiome can be used to differentiate diverticular disease phenotypes. Uncovering such differences would be of great potential clinical significance, since they could be modeled to (i) enable outcome prediction and risk stratification; (ii) provide avenues for treatment and prevention, and (iii) reveal insight into pathogenesis. In pursuit of this goal, we plan to profile the intestinal microbiome in diverticular disease using two parallel study cohorts: (i) 100 patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis recruited prospectively from the outpatient endoscopy units of two large teaching hospitals; and (ii) 100 prospectively identified patients with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. Replicate fecal DNA samples will be collected longitudinally from each study individual using well-tested methods. We will then perform intestinal microbiome profiling using a combination of metagenomic Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (tRFLP) analysis and a novel digital 16S fingerprinting approach utilizing next-generation sequencing. These data will yield deep, high-resolution fingerprints of the intestinal microbial metagenome in each disease population, which can then be compared to identify composite biomarkers that predict disease complications.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use innovative molecular techniques to profile the intestinal microbiota in both patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and those with diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis. The identification of a unique microbial metagenomic fingerprint in patients with diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis could provide the basis for a non-invasive screening tool for at-risk individuals, and/or for directed preventative interventions. This study has important public health implications since diverticulosis is extremely common and there is currently no way to identify patients at risk for complications and preventative strategies are limited.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is associated with serious cardiovascular complications that include atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and myocardial dysfunction even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease, a disorder termed diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Data from studies of animal models and human subjects provide evidence that alterations in myocardial lipid metabolism is central to the pathogenesis of DCM, which early on can be asymptomatic, but which can progress to symptomatic heart failure. The ability to identify new disease markers to facilitate early detection and intervention is limited b inadequacies of existing measures of systemic and myocardial lipid metabolism in humans. In our Preliminary Studies, we have addressed this problem by using sensitive mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify two plasma very long-chain ceramides, Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0), that are highly correlated with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction in obese and type 2 diabetic humans. Cell biological and mouse model studies suggest these species arise from the unique intersection of ectopic lipid accumulation and activation of innate immune signaling pathways. We hypothesize that plasma Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0) reflect systemic alterations in lipid metabolism that can be exploited as novel biomarkers for DCM. While the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction can be readily made noninvasively by echocardiogram, Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0) track with pathophysiological consequences of ectopic lipid accumulation and thus have potential to predict individuals at risk, to further our understanding of disease mechanism, and to identify new treatment targets. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team to extend these findings by 1) Developing a robust high-throughput clinical assay for Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0); 2) Validating and extending these findings in two existing cohorts of human subjects; 3) Exploring the mechanistic links between very long-chain ceramides and cardiac dysfunction in relevant mouse models of DCM; and 4) Defining the direction of causality in the relationships among lipid exposure, plasma ceramides, and cardiac function in humans with type 2 diabetes. Our approach has the potential to define an integrated measure of pathophysiologically relevant lipid exposure that can be used to track intervention success, data linking phenotype to a modifiable risk factor that is currently undertreated in the target population (dyslipidemia), and marker for future disease risk that can be acted upon to prevent clinically apparent morbidity and mortality.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes is associated with serious cardiovascular complications including heart failure that is unrelated to coronary artery disease. Scientific evidence suggests that blood fat levels play a major role in this complication. Our study will investigate the link between blood fat levels and heart function in adults with type 2 diabetes. Our goal is to develop new blood-based biomarkers of heart disease in diabetics and to provide insight into mechanisms underlying this disorder that will inform new therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains a major health problem in India. To understand the complex pathogenesis of VL, TMRC examined key questions in epidemiology, immunology and genetics of disease. We developed the resources, infrastructure and manpower necessary for long term research activities. We achieved the major objectives of all 3 projects, obtaining interesting results that have mostly been brought to the scientific community working in related fields. In TRMC II we want to build on the results of TMRC I, to gain greater understanding of the evolution of the human host/pathogen relationship. TMRC II has therefore been divided into 4 major projects with 4 core facilities. Project 1 will be on the determinants of disease progression and role of latent infection in transmission and will study the role of asymptomatic infection in VL at clinical and public health levels. By generating this evidence we expect to be able to inform control programs, as well as clinical decision-making, to decrease spread of disease in the endemic region. We will also be investigating the role of other NTDs in coinfection with VL. Project 2 constitutes studies of the sand fly vector to improve currently inadequate vector control efforts. This project will test a number of hypotheses, challenging current conventions related to the sand fly vector of VL in Bihar, P. argentipes. Project 3 on immune regulation in VL will continue work aimed at understanding the ever evading immunosuppressive pathways that account for severe progression and fatal outcome of untreated VL. In TMRC I, we demonstrated that whole blood of active VL has the capacity to produce antigen specific IFNg and IL-10, which is biologically active in preventing parasite killing. We want to learn how to subvert the activity of IL-10. Project 4 will carry forwad major findings from a GWAS undertaken in TMRC I to determine the molecular and cellular action of HLA class II molecules, which will have major implications for therapeutic intervention and vaccine design.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria continues to cause marked morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection can result in severe life threatening disease, mild symptoms or an asymptomatic carriage state. Protection from severe disease outcomes naturally occurs in residents high Plasmodium falciparum transmission regions. This protection is related to repeated malaria exposures which result in mild to asymptomatic carriage rather than devastating complications which occur in non-immune individuals. The basis of this clinical observation made decades ago remains poorly characterized. Our group and others have identified a role for type I INF response during malarial infection. Type I INF is known as a powerful immunomodulatory molecule that can promote activation, differentiation or even apoptosis of effector cells such as NK and T lymphocytes and favor cross-priming by DCs. Thus, our working hypothesis proposes that a stronger type I IFN response in malaria infections is associated with a more protective host innate and adaptive immune responses. We will examine the role of type IINF during mild malaria and whether this response changes during repeated infections in one individual, alters the risk of re-infection and is associated with transmission intensity. This proposal brings Dr. Lauvau's expertise in studying immune responses against microbial pathogens, Dr. Daily's expertise in transcriptional analysis with the Malawi ICEMR program to characterize innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses in children with mild disease in a longitudinal study. This proposal will enhance the Malawi ICEMR goals of understanding the determinants of malarial disease. Host immune responses alter the development of malarial disease and thus this proposal will provide a further characterization of host responses to inform disease models. We will also address how changes in transmission intensity through malaria control interventions in the parent study may alter host response and disease presentation. Finally, this proposal will further the training mission of the Malawi ICEMR by training Malawian scientists and building in-country laboratory and scientific capacity in malaria immunology.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates specific aspects of the immune response associated with malaria infections in humans, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We will examine the role of type I interferon, a powerful immunomodulatory molecule during infection and whether this response changes during repeated infections in one individual, alters the risk of re-infection and is associated with transmission intensity.

       " 'Project Summary/AbstractThe long-term objective of this application is to understand the molecular pathogenesis of infection with theintracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. The parasite is an important pathogen in immunosuppressedpopulations and is classified by the NIAID as a category B biodefense organism. Nevertheless, in most casesinfection with this widespread parasite is asymptomatic. Host survival during infection requires robust Type 1cytokine production, yet overly exuberant responses can result in host pathology and death. Thus, bothparasite and host benefit from regulated proinflammatory cytokine responses. The underlying hypothesis to betested is that T. gondii possesses molecular mechanisms to subvert host signaling pathways leading toproinflammatory cytokine production. Recent work has revealed the ability of Toxoplasma to down-regulatecytokines such as TNF-? from within infected cells. Increasing evidence indicates this is achieved throughsophisticated manipulation of host intracellular signaling cascades. The goal of this proposal is to elucidatemechanisms by which Toxoplasma subverts proinflammatory signaling cascades in the innate immune system,in particular within cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells that are targeted for in vivo infection. Cellularand biochemical methods will be employed to define the points at which Toxoplasma interferes with host signaltransduction. In this regard, parasite-induced activation of signaling molecule STAT3, known to be involved indown-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-?, will be examined. The nature of TNF-?suppression in infected macrophages is profound. Therefore, we will employ molecular methods to determinehow the parasite influences promoter activity of the TNF-? gene. The last part of this proposal will focus efforton examining if parasite-infected macrophages and dendritic cells display a suppression phenotype during invivo mouse infections. This will be accomplished using cellular and immunological methods to determine IL-12and TNF-? production in infected cells in vivo and their in vivo ability to respond to defined Toll-like receptor? ligands. In addition, macrophage and dendritic cell expression of cell surface activation markers will beanalyzed. From these studies, we expect to gain important information on how T. gondii interacts with the hostinnate immune system, allowing a deeper understanding of infection with this important opportunisticpathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCEThe relevance of the project to public health is that Toxoplasma infects between 30-80% of the humanpopulation worldwide. While normally an asymptomatic infection, with suboptimal immune function the parasiteemerges as a devastating and sometimes lethal infection. This project will enhance our understanding ofimmunity to the parasite, leading to improved treatment strategies.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of the proposed work is to provide evidence that changes in iron homeostasis relate to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis or plaque buildup in arteries is the disease responsible for the vast majority of heart attacks, strokes, and events due to peripheral vascular disease that together cause death and disability for tens of millions of Americans. A relatively unexplored hypothesis explaining why women have a 10-20 year lag in onset of cardiovascular events due to atherosclerosis (CVD) is that monthly loss of iron is cardioprotective, and that cessation of menses at menopause accelerates CVD. Preventive approaches based on hormone therapy have been disappointing, causing increases in stroke and cardiovascular events instead of reductions. Additional motivation to investigate iron in CVD arises from recent evidence identifying the effects of inflammation and iron on hepcidin, the key regulator of macrophage iron uptake and release. Furthermore, iron catalyzes the generation of free radicals that oxidize cholesterol stimulating atheroma formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideally suited to study iron because of iron's local effects on magnetic susceptibility that can be quantified using a relaxation parameter called T2* (`T2-star'), as well as the ability to noninvasively characterize and quantify atherosclerotic plaque with MRI. Thus, we seek in this work to provide critical evidence to motivate the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics based on iron's role in atherosclerosis by achieving the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Measure changes in arterial wall magnetic susceptibility in perimenopausal women. Hypothesis 1a: Arterial wall T2* decreases in the transition from perimenopausal to postmenopausal status. Hypothesis 1b: Carotid artery wall T2* varies inversely with wall thickness and pulse wave velocity. Aim 2: Identify changes in iron uptake mechanisms in perimenopausal women. Hypothesis 2: Serum hepcidin increases in the transition from perimenopausal to postmenopausal status. Aim 3: Identify differences in iron homeostasis that can influence plaque magnetic susceptibility. Hypothesis 3a: In vivo carotid plaque T2* varies inversely with intraplaque ferritin content. Hypothesis 3b: Patients with symptom-producing carotid artery plaque undergoing surgery have higher serum hepcidin levels compared to asymptomatic patients with carotid artery plaque undergoing surgery. Aim 4: Identify mechanisms relating plaque biomarkers and iron homeostasis to plaque progression in patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis. Hypothesis 4: Change in T2* has a negative association with plaque progression in asymptomatic patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis not requiring surgery. Significance: If vascular iron is shown to increase in women post-menopause and in atherosclerosis progression, we will have identified a truly novel target to attenuate CVD risk in both men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis) causes heart attacks, strokes, and other complications that make heart and vascular disease the leading killer of Americans. Women tend to develop plaque buildup 10 to 20 years later than men. This research tests the theory that monthly loss of iron through menses is protective against atherosclerosis, which could lead to an entirely new approach to preventing and treating heart and vascular disease in both men and women.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis is an important component of treatment for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Many novel therapeutic strategies are being developed in combination with AAT in the next generation of clinical trials for GBM. Unfortunately, these combinations have been developed without an understanding of how AAT influences the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in and around the tumor core and the subsequent delivery of novel chemotherapeutic agents across the BBB. During gliomagenesis, expression of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors promotes development of an immature tumor vasculature with partial BBB disruption. AAT-mediated inhibition of VEGF signaling can restore tight junction integrity and potentially promote expression of BBB drug efflux transporters, i.e.,  normalize  theBBB vasculature. Many drugs being tested in GBM clinical trials in combination with AAT have limited BBB penetration. Studies in this application will test the central hypothesis that AAT-mediated restoration of BBB integrity may paradoxically reduce delivery of concomitantly administered drugs to the tumor, leading to reduced efficacy. This hypothesis will be tested both in the Mayo panel of primary GBM xenografts and in University of Minnesota-derived genetically engineered GBM models (GEMMs). Aim one will determine the influence of the anti-VEGF antibody, Bev, the VEGFR inhibitor, cediranib, and a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, GNE-317, on brain microvasculature function (perfusion, tight junctions and efflux transport) in primary GBM xenografts and GEMMs. Aim two will examine how anti-angiogenic effects of Bev and GNE-317 alter drug delivery (site-specific pharmacokinetics) for relevant agents that have different BBB permeability characteristics (e.g., temozolomide, erlotinib, GDC-0980 and GNE-317). We hypothesize that AAT will have a variable detrimental impact on delivery and resultant efficacy depending on the combination therapy. Aim three will test two distinct strategies to improve the efficacy of combination therapies: a) disruption of BBB efflux transporter activity to enhance the efficacy of AAT-transporter substrate combinations, and b) manipulation of chemical structure to reduce efflux liability and increase passive permeability to enhance efficacy of AAT + PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combinations. Many novel agents for GBM being developed in combination with AAT are excluded by the BBB. Thus, understanding the impact of AAT on BBB integrity and drug delivery is critical for successful development of AAT combination therapies for recurrent GBM. The planned studies will define critical parameters that influence the efficacy of AAT combination regimens and use that information to improve patient outcome in future trials that combine anti-angiogenic agents with other novel therapeutics.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anti-angiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, block blood vessel growth and are important treatments for deadly brain tumors. However, bevacizumab and other anti-angiogenic drugs can also make blood vessels less leaky, especially in the brain, and might reduce the delivery of other chemotherapy drugs when given together in these brain cancers. This could reduce the effectiveness of certain combinations of drugs. The planned studies will test this possibility and identify methods to increase drug delivery and effectivenessof combined drug treatments. Ultimately, these studies will have an impact on improving the survival of patients with brain tumors.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is more common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) than in the general population. Clinical manifestations of PHPT are more severe in vitamin D deficient patients, and even in those with mild disease, patients with low vitamin D levels have higher PTH concentrations and bone turnover markers. Given the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the PHPT population, it is likely that our current understanding of the biochemical and skeletal features of PHPT reflects an admixture of these two conditions. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that in patients with PHPT: 1) Vitamin D deficiency worsens the hyperparathyroid state and is associated with its own specific skeletal features; and 2) Repletion of vitamin D will ameliorate those aspects of the disease that are due to vitamin D deficiency, and thus reveal the true biochemical and skeletal phenotype of the underlying disease. To test these hypotheses, this proposal will utilize state-of-the-art biochemical and skeletal imaging methods. The proposal has the following aims: 1. To compare PHPT patients with and without vitamin D deficiency in order to: a) determine the skeletal features of the hyperparathyroid state that are attributable to vitamin D deficiency; and b) to describe the skeleton in PHPT without the confounding effects of co- existing vitamin D deficiency. 2. To investigate the early effects of high dose vitamin D repletion on histomorphometric parameters of bone remodeling (by quadruple labeled bone biopsy). 3. To investigate the effects of three vitamin D repletion regimens on biochemical, denstometric, microarchitectural and biomechanical features of PHPT. This proposal will fulfill a key mandate of the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism (2008) to obtain more data on vitamin D deficiency in individuals with PHPT. The recently published International Consensus Guidelines on Asymptomatic PHPT (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94:335-9, 2009) specifically call for measurement of 25- hydroxyvitamin D in all patients with PHPT, and repletion of low levels (<20 ng/ml). However, no recommendations for repletion were included in the Guidelines, because of limited data upon which to base them. This information is urgently needed, as are data on the effects of vitamin D treatment in PHPT upon clinically relevant endpoints such as bone density, skeletal microarchitecture, bone remodeling and bone strength. This proposal will therefore enhance our understanding of the skeleton in PHPT, while providing information that may help in formulating recommendations for vitamin D repletion, a key research goal of the new Consensus Guidelines, and an imperative for clinicians treating this disorder. The ultimate benefit will be to patients with PHPT, for whom clinical decision-making will be strengthened by data that have heretofore not been available.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary hyperparathyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, frequently presents with co-existing vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency not only heightens the severity of the parathyroid disease, but may also increase the risk of non-skeletal health problems. This proposal will provide data on vitamin D deficiency in primary hyperparathyroidism, first by comparing patients with and without co-existing vitamin D deficiency; and then by examining the effects of vitamin D repletion. The studies will therefore enhance our understanding of the skeleton in primary hyperparathyroidism, while providing information that may help in formulating recommendations for vitamin D repletion, a key research goal of the 2008 International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism, and an imperative for clinicians treating this common disorder.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs is presently the most commonly used weapon in the treatment of advanced cancer. However, the therapeutic efficacy of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is limited by factors such as tumor heterogeneity, host toxicity and drug resistance. Recent advances in drug development have provided new opportunities to improve cancer therapy using drugs that target the tumor vasculature and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. To date, however, the survival benefit of these angiogenesis inhibitors has been rather modest and efforts to improve activity by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have been only partially successful. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel, more effective approaches to combining angiogenesis inhibitors with traditional cancer chemotherapeutics, building on progress made in the last project period in studies using the VEGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib and the liver cytochrome P450-activated anti-cancer prodrug cyclophosphamide. The major aims of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the mechanism whereby anti-angiogenic drug treatment blocks tumor regression induced by metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment and then devise alternative therapeutic approaches that circumvent this block; 2) to investigate the use of provascular strategies to enhance tumor delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs given in conjunction with anti-angiogenesis; 3) to harness the anti-vascular effects of anti-angiogenic drugs so as to increase tumor cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs administered intratumorally via an intratumoral 'trapping' (enhanced drug retention) mechanism; and 4) to investigate the impact of changes in tumor microvessel density, neovascularization and vascular maturity on responsiveness to the combination of anti-angiogenic drug treatment with chemotherapy. Together, these studies will elucidate ways to increase responsiveness to anti-angiogenic drugs by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in a way that improves overall therapeutic activity, and will thereby advance the development of anti-cancer therapies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates ways to increase responsiveness to anti-angiogenic drugs by combination with conventional cancer chemotherapeutic agents. These studies may identify strategies that can be used to improve the therapeutic effectiveness of anti-angiogenic drugs in the clinic, and thereby advance the development of anti-cancer therapies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the success of highly active anti-retroviral therapy in controlling virus replication in HIV-1 positive individuals, problems such as drug resistance and side effects often compromise the effectiveness of anti-HIV- 1 drug. Therefore, new anti-HIV agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed. In an effort to identify novel anti-HIV-1 agents, we have developed potent betulinic acid (BA) derivatives that inhibit HIV-1 maturation. These compounds are structurally and mechanistically novel when compared to the drugs currently used for AIDS therapy. Their potentials for treatment of AIDS are currently being evaluated under different stages of preclinical or clinical studies. Bevirimat is at the most advanced stage of drug development among the anti- HIV-1 BA derivatives. Although bevirimat is a potent HIV-1 maturation inhibitor, results of phase II clinical trials indicate that it is less effective in a subset (30-40%) of HIV-1 positive individuals. Therefore, bevirimat analogs that can overcome this high baseline drug resistance are expected to have great potential to be developed into anti-HIV-1 drugs. The objective of this study is to synthesize bevirimat analogs that overcome the high baseline drug resistance. We have previously identified the C3 side chain as the anti-HIV-1 maturation pharmacophore of bevirimat. We hypothesize that suitable modifications of the pharmacophore will create a new class of bevirimat analogs that are effective against the drug resistant viruses. We plan to test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this study with the following Specific Aims: (1) to synthesize BA derivatives with optimized pharmacophores. (2) To identify new terpenoid scaffolds and auxiliary groups for the synthesis of new anti-maturation inhibitors against the drug resistant viruses. (3) To determine the drug binding site and mechanism of action of the anti-HIV-1 maturation BA derivatives. Aside from the high baseline drug resistance to bevirimat, results from clinical trials have been promising. The proposed study is expected to overcome this drug resistance and, as a result, will have a high impact on developing a class of novel anti-HIV-1 maturation inhibitors for AIDS therapy.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed study is to develop potent anti-HIV-1 agents that can overcome the drug resistance associated with the HIV-1 maturation inhibitor bevirimat. Aside from the high baseline drug resistance to bevirimat, results of clinical trials have been very successful. The proposed study is expected to overcome this drug resistance and, as a result, will have high impact on developing anti-HIV-1 maturation inhibitors for AIDS therapy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virally-encoded neuraminidase plays a key role in the life-cycle of the influenza virus. A class of anti-influenza drugs that inhibits the action of neuraminidase has garnered increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their selectivity and potency. The inhibitors are transition state analogs of the enzyme substrate, sialic acid, and are highly efficacious in in vitro and in vivo studies, with IC50 values in the nM range. However these drugs are very polar and consequently have poor oral bioavailability. At TSRL, we have a developed an amino acid prodrug strategy that targets intestinal transporters for enhanced uptake. Subsequent activation of the absorbed prodrug can then occur either through targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of the prodrug or chemical breakdown of the prodrug to the activate parent compound. This strategy is based on a molecular mechanistic understanding of the transport and activation pathways in cells and tissues and the interaction of prodrug structures with these pathways. In this proposal, we have developed novel amino acid prodrugs of two neuraminidase inhibitors and provide strong supporting data showing that these prodrugs are actively transported by intestinal transporter and are well absorbed. We show that through our approach, we can boost the oral availability of selected neuraminidase inhibitors to an extent that they are effective in animal models of influenza and have high potential to be developed as oral drug products. In the current project, we propose to select a lead neuraminidase inhibitor by in vivo (mouse and ferret) testing of the developed series of compounds against a range of influenza strains, including recent H1N1 isolates, seasonal flu isolates, drug resistant virus and high pathogenic strains of the virus. Our  molecular mechanistic  approach to prodrug design has enormous potential for the development of orally effective neuraminidase inhibitors.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TSRL has developed an approach to improve the oral bioavailability of anti-influenza drugs, thus making them suitable for oral delivery. We propose to synthesize and test a series of these compounds for their potential as oral anti-influenza agents. Ultimately, this approach may increase the number of potent anti-virus compounds that are available for therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of influenza.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is no  cure  for herpes simplex virus (HSV) latent infections of neurons, and the possibility of asymptomatic reactivation and simultaneous transfer of infectious virus via mucous membranes is a significant drawback of current therapies. We have pioneered the study of selective inhibitors of the herpes virus-specific thymidine kinase (TK), the enzyme responsible both for  activation  of anti-herpes nucleoside analogs and for reactivation of virus from the latent state in sensory nerve ganglia. Animal studies, however, have required intraperitoneal dosing of test compounds because the compounds are poorly soluble in water and not sufficiently orally available to warrant study of their effectiveness by the oral route. Among strategies to enhance oral absorption of candidate drugs, we have synthesized the 6-deoxy analogs of two promising compounds, and have found that one of these, which we call SacrovirTM, has moderate oral absorption in the mouse, which is enhanced by mixing with the solubilizing polymer Soluplus, and is converted nearly completely into the ultimate drug N2-[m-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] guanine, mCF3PG. Thus, we propose to develop one or more formulations that will greatly increase the oral absorption of Sacrovir and show oral efficacy in animal models of HSV reactivation. To achieve this goal, our specific aims are to: 1. formulate the pro-drug Sacrovir (6-deoxy-mCF3PG) to enhance its intestinal absorption; strategies include emulsions, small molecule adjuvants, and solubility enhancers; 2. Compare oral bioavailability of Sacrovir formulations in the mouse, by analyzing plasma samples by LC-MS methods for both the pro-drug and the ultimate drug mCF3PG; 3. determine the oral bioavailability of mCF3PG in rabbits and guinea pigs after oral treatment with Sacrovir; and 4) test, through collaborators, the efficacy of oral Sacrovir in rabbit and guinea pi models of HSV reactivation. Following successful demonstration of an optimal oral formulation of Sacrovir, the experiments of aim 4 to test efficacy in rabbit and guinea pig models, respectively, will be conducted by subcontractor Dr. James M. Hill at LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, and by Drs. David Bernstein and Rhonda Cardin of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, under contract from NIAID (Dr. Heather Greenstone, Antiviral Branch). Positive results will be used as background to secure additional funding, for example through a phase II small business grant, and ultimately from a corporate sponsor or licensee, to fully develop the drug. The pro-drug Sacrovir will represent a first-in-class, novel oral treatment for HSV latent infections of neurons and, importantly, will prevent both asymptomatic virus shedding and the resulting transmission of infection to sex partners.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is no  cure  for herpes simplex virus infections; asymptomatic reactivation of virus from the latent state in neurons and its transfer via mucous membranes is a significant drawback of current therapies. We have synthesized a pro-drug  SacrovirTM  that is both orally absorbed in mice and converted metabolically to the ultimate anti-reactivation drug,  mCF3PG . In this project we will develop a formulation of Sacrovir that will increase its oral absorption in mice, and show that this formulation will have efficacy in rabit and guinea pigs models of herpes simplex reactivation. Sacrovir represents a first-in-class, novel oral treatment for latent herpes simplex infections of neurons and, importantly, will preventtransmission of infectious virus.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection of a cell by HIV-1 proceeds through a series of steps, each of which defines a potential target for antiviral drug intervention. Current drugs target key viral activities catalyzed by the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes, but emergence of drug resistance calls for continual development of new drugs with novel modes of action. HIV-1 depends on interactions with numerous cellular proteins as it replicates and maraviroc, a drug that disrupts the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein and cellular surface CCR5 receptor, is an approved inhibitor of a virus-cell interaction that blocks the ability of the virus to enter the cell. Also crucial to HIV-1 replicatin is the ability for the preintegration complex intermediate that houses the integrase and reverse transcript to access the chromosomes inside the cell nucleus, where viral DNA integration takes place. Lentiviruses like HIV-1 use an energy-dependent process to transport their preintegration complexes through nuclear pore complexes that riddle the biphasic nuclear envelope, though the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 nuclear transport are poorly understood. Work supported by this renewal grant application identified numerous cellular proteins as potential critical cofactors of HIV-1 replication and a significant number of these, including transportin-3,nucleoporin 153, and nucleoporin 358 were accordingly implicated in preintegration complex nuclear import due to their known functions within the cell. Subsequent work indeed confirmed this contention, though it remains unclear how these and other cellular and viral proteins precisely dictate HIV-1 preintegration complex nuclear import. Using numerous virology, biochemical, and genetic approaches, the work proposed herein will determine the mechanisms of HIV-1 nuclear import, focusing on novel protein interactions between the virus and host cellular components that are essential for the process. Such discoveries will define new targets for the development of inhibitors that block critical HIV-host interactions, which would be expected to increase the breadth of future antiviral armaments in the ongoing battle to control the spread of HIV/AIDS.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite HAART successes, drug resistance emerges due to the inherent viral genetic barrier required to build resistance to any given compound plus associated toxicity of compound use, which significantly affects patient compliance. These observations highlight the ongoing need to develop new antiviral inhibitors, and crucial interactions between HIV-1 and cellular cofactors have been highlighted in recent years as novel drug targets. This proposal will uncover novel details of how the HIV-1 preintegration complex, a critical viral replication intermediate, accesses the cellular nucleus where viral integration occurs, which will define novel targets for antiviral drug development moving forward.',\n",
       " 'While symptomatic congestive heart failure from coronary artery disease is increasing in prevalence, there areeven more patients that have asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Asymptomatic LVSD(or Stage B heart failure) accounts for the majority of patients with a depressed ejection fraction and coronaryartery disease. Some of these patients have prior myocardial infarctions and nontransmural scars from thecontemporary management of ST elevation MI with reperfusion therapy. Others have viable dysfunctionalmyocardium reflecting the slow but cumulative myocyte loss from repetitive ischemia and left ventricular re-modeling. This proposal is intended to determine whether intracoronary cell based therapy can ameliorate re-gional LV dysfunction at a stage of disease where clinical heart failure is absent and ongoing myocyte deathand neurohormonal activation are minimal. The central hypothesis is that a myocardial microenvironment de-void of ongoing stressors promoting cell death will facilitate exogenous and endogenous myocyte regenerationfrom cell based therapy. Our completed work in a model of hibernating myocardium devoid of infarction sup-ports this hypothesis and demonstrates that intracoronary mesenchymal stem cells (icMSCs) stimulate en-dogenous myocyte proliferation through a paracrine mechanism with a resultant increase in myocyte nucleardensity. Cardiosphere derived cells (CDCs) isolated from myocardial biopsies provide an alternative source ofadult stem cells that have been demonstrated to improve function after intracoronary injection through both di-rect differentiation into cardiac myocytes as well as by stimulating endogenous myocyte proliferation. In ahead-to-head fashion, this proposal will determine the relative efficacy of these two therapies in viable dysfunc-tional myocardium vs. reperfused myocardial infarcts prior to the development of heart failure. To ultimatelyenhance translation, studies will be conducted in swine with a heart size similar to humans. Aim 1 will deter-mine whether icCDCs are superior to icMSCs in chronic regional LV dysfunction. They will also define whethertreatments are more efficacious when administered to hibernating vs. infarcted myocardium. Physiologicalend-points will include improvement in regional LV function and myocardial perfusion at rest and vasodilation.Aim 2 will evaluate the role of icMSCs and CDCs to amplify endogenous myocyte proliferation vs. differentia-tion of stem cells into a cardiac phenotype. Serial stem cell fate will be tracked in vivo using PET/CT 18[F]-FHBG imaging of cells transfected with a lentiviral triple reporter construct complimented with fluorescence andbioluminescence in tissue samples. Serial assessment of LV mass, volumes and infarct size from imaging willbe complimented with immunohistochemistry to quantify the amount of new myocardium regenerated. Aim 3will use a discovery based proteomic approach employing label free LC/MS to identify paracrine factors differ-entially upregulated following icCDCs and icMSCs. The results will identify the stem cell and pathological sub-strate most likely to benefit patients with asymptomatic LVSD before clinical heart failure develops.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classifying disease stage and elucidating a prognosis, which allow the most effective medical intervention, are unattainable when the underlying pathological changes, or the correlates of stage and prognosis, are associated with heterogeneous cells states within a larger population. Single cell analyses can provide an unsurpassed means to measure and unravel heterogeneity in complex biological systems, and thereby to understand the basis for (or to identify correlates of) changes in biological function and disease processes. Here we propose to develop a rapid assay for detection of antigen-specific responses in single T cells from small amounts of blood, based on state-of-the-art techniques that are sensitive and robust. Our proposal aims at developing a test that provides tuberculosis (TB) diagnosticians with the critical ability to distinguish stable latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (when the asymptomatic subject is not progressing to disease, is not infectious, and does not require treatment) from preclinical disease (when the asymptomatic subject is developing disease, is still not infectious, and requires early treatment to block progression of disease and drastically curb transmission of infection). Our multidisciplinary team includes expertise in development of novel single cell analysis methodology, cellular immunology, and biomarker research for TB, which still causes millions of cases of disease and death worldwide every year. Our assay is expected to yield multi-parameter measurements of single T cell functional states by integrating (i) use of artificial Ag-presenting cells (aAPC) to activate T cell receptor signaling and stimulation of gene expression, with (ii) measurement of inducible tell-tale markers of T cell activation and function by quantitative flow cytometry. Induced gene expression will be detected by mRNA enumeration using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). The research plan is articulated in four aims, each focused on the development of a specific aspect of the assay: (1) read-out: detection of activation markers in single T cells by smFISH and flow cytometry following conventional stimulation; (2) stimulation: response to aAPC assessed by detection of activation markers in single T cells; (3) response to infection-stage-specific Ag: association of single T cell responses with disease vs asymptomatic infection; (4) infection-stage-specific functional T cell signatures: multi-parameter characterization of single T cell responses and association with disease vs asymptomatic infection. The proposed plan should lead to recognizing and treating active TB prior to the appearance of microbiological and clinical signs and symptoms of disease. This is the current holy grail in TB diagnosis as it is considered to be critical to TB elimination efforts. The new assay principles will be translatable for diagnosis anddisease staging of any pathology with T cell involvement, including other infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmunity, and transplantation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful intervention in many diseases is often severely limited by insufficient understanding of the complex underlying pathology. In particular, the ability to classify the disease stage and to elucidate a prognosis may be poor or even impossible when pathological changes are identifiable only in a small number of cells within a larger population. Here we propose to develop a new immunological test that can identify, from among persons carrying an asymptomatic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria that cause tuberculosis), those individuals progressing toward disease and becoming infectious. Two billion people (about one-third of the world's population) are currently infected with the TB bacteria, with the highest concentration of new cases in resource-poor areas of South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Even though 90-95% of infected persons do not become sick, the number of infected individuals is high enough to give rise to 8 million new cases of TB and almost 2 million deaths each year worldwide. Existing blood-based clinical immunodiagnostic assays recognize TB infection but are not geared to distinguish between asymptomatic infection and active disease. The latter is currently identified only when patients excrete TB bacilli while coughing or sneezing (it is estimated that, by the time of diagnosis, a person with active TB has already infected up to twenty contacts). Thus, for public health purposes, it is critical to diagnose active disease when the patient is still asymptomatic and non-infectious. We propose to develop a new, rapid test requiring small amounts of blood that detects tell-tale immune cell subpopulations distinguishing the relevant groups. The detection method in this test requires basic flow cytometry, a technique routinely utilized in the clinical diagnosis of immunopathologies and fully accessible to district/peripheral level clinical laboratories that currently operate a fluorescence microscope in resource-poor regions. Translation of the proposed diagnostic methodology to clinical practice will allow identification and treatment of early cases of TB, thus impeding transmission and helping eliminate TB. While the present proposal is directed to a specific set of end-users in TB clinics, the proposed assay has broad public health relevance, because the same principles and methodologies are directly applicable to any infectious and non-infectious disease that can be characterized based on the properties of single immune cells involved in the body's recognition of or response to a particular condition.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health crisis of malaria-HIV co-infection is rapidly expanding in sub-Saharan Africa. Lowland western Kenya in particular is holoendemic for malaria transmission and is plagued with catastrophically high rates of HIV/AIDS infection. A 2006 mathematical model of transmission in this region retrospectively predicted that co-infection has resulted in a cumulative excess of 8,500 HIV-1 infections and 980,000 malaria episodes since 1980. Individuals infected with HIV experience more frequent and more severe episodes of clinical malaria and the risk increases with advancing HIV disease. However, our pilot studies and a significant body of published data also suggest that specific increases in asymptomatic parasitemias and gametocytemias also are likely to occur in HIV-infected individuals in malaria-holoendemic areas. While numerous studies have examined one or more of the complicating aspects of co-infection and symptomatic malaria in cross-sectional studies, no studies have attempted to determine the longitudinal epidemiological impact of co-infection on asymptomatic malaria and specifically on malaria transmission in regions characterized by high transmission of both diseases and by increasing antimalarial drug resistance. Antifolates are widely prescribed for prophylaxis of HIV-associated opportunistic infections, yet they are also known to increase the appearance of gametocytes. We hypothesize that co-infection with HIV, and associated therapy, could be directly responsible for significant increases in asymptomatic parasite carriage and gametocytemia as well as increased antifolate- resistant parasite genotypes and, therefore, contribute directly to the increased burden of falciparum malaria. To this end, we propose to focus complementary clinical and entomological studies using highly sensitive and specific molecular tools in a highly endemic area of western Kenya to assess point and longitudinal prevalence's of co-infection in general and gametocytemia in particular with an emphasis on longitudinal risk of malaria transmission in the context of prevailing HIV therapies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV and malaria co-infection has resulted in increased clinical malaria prevalence, although the causes for this increase are incompletely understood. In our studies, we will examine a novel hypothesis that increased malaria burden in Kenya is due in part to enhanced mosquito-borne transmission of malaria from co-infected patients.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the UMDNJ/Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence, which is specifically focused on the discovery and development of drugs to treat poisoning from exposure to vesicants including sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and other mechanistically related chemical threat agents. The Center consists of three Research and Development Projects, each focused on a major vesicant target: the eye, lung and skin. Research is centered on elucidating specific mechanisms of vesicant toxicity, with the overall goal of identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. These projects are supported by a Pharmacology and Drug Development Core and a Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics Core consisting of investigators with considerable expertise in drug discovery, delivery and development. Important lead compounds have been identified and innovative formulations and delivery systems developed that increase pharmacological activity and improve pharmacokinetic profiles. Over 150 potential therapeutic compounds were synthesized, formulated, and evaluated for efficacy in vitro and against vesicant-induced injury resulting in four distinct families that will be chemically optimized during the renewal period. A Training and Education Program has been established directed at students, postdoctoral fellows and health care providers at the Universities of CounterACT investigators. During the next grant period, mechanistic research will focus on following novel discoveries related to how vesicants damage tissues including studies on autophagy, matrix metalloproteinases, ER stress proteins, and the role of macrophage subpopulations. The Pharmacology and Drug Development Core will continue to have informal meetings with the FDA, conduct IND-enabling studies, coordinate activities with external collaborators; it will also evaluate and advance selected lead compounds. The Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmaceutics Core will chemically optimize lead compounds in four promising classes, as well as develop strategies and targeted delivery systems to support multiple agent/ multiple mechanism treatment regimes for vesicant-mediated wound healing. It is anticipated that Center efforts will result in new drugs that will be in the approval process for treating vesicant poisoning in humans.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall research aim of this Center of Excellence in Malaria Research is to organize a comprehensive approach to understanding the biological features of Amazonian malaria towards the ultimate goal of regional control and elimination of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. We focus primarily on P. vivax due to its greater impact in the region. We anticipate that the lessons learned will contribute towards the audacious goal of global malaria eradication. An integrated and interactive set of 5 projects will be supported by Administrative, Data Management and Shared Laboratory Resource Cores to study malaria epidemiology, vector biology and ecology, diagnostics, transmission biology and clinical pathogenesis towards the goal of malaria control, regional elimination and eradication in the Amazon region of South America. Three epidemiological distinct sites primarily affected by P. vivax (~80% of cases) but also by P. falciparum (~20%) of cases will be studied: Acre, Brazil; Iquitos, Peru; and Madre de Dio/Puerto Maldonado, Peru. Investigators from University of Sao Paulo and the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru will be the lead foreign collaborators, and will join forces with lead institution University of California San Diego, and collaborating institutions Wadsworth Center of the New York Health Department, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center Detachment, Lima, Peru to carry out the aims of the Center.  RELEVANCE: The Peru/Brazil Center of Excellence in Malaria Research will take an integrated approach to the study of malaria epidemiology, vector biology and ecology, diagnostics, transmission biology and clinical pathogenesis to underpin malaria control, elimination and eradication efforts in the Amazon region of South America.  PROJECT 1: Title: Epidemiology of Malaria in the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon Project Leader: Ferreira, M.  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Institutions based in two malaria-endemic countries, Brazil and Peru, are partnering with a leading research group in the USA with the long-term goal of providing scientific evidence that can be translated into effective public health interventions for malaria control in Amazonia. To determine whether asymptomatic parasite carriage is a major contributor to malaria transmission across the region, we aim: (a) to estimate the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for asymptomatic malaria parasite carriage in rural Amazonia; (b) to estimate the prevalence, incidence, average duration and risk factors for gametocyte carriage; (c) to compare the ability of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of gametocytes to experimentally infect wild-caught local vectors; (d) to compare prospectively the risk of subsequent clinical malaria among asymptomatic parasite carriers and non-infected controls living in the same communities and to determine whether these episodes are due to persistent parasite lineages or to new infections; and (e) to test whether intra-host competition of genetically distinct parasite clones contributes to increased parasite virulence, greater risk of disease, and increased gametocyte production. These aims will be achieved with population-based surveys, using uniformized clinical and laboratory protocols, in three epidemiologically diverse Amazonian settings: (a) a typical agricultural settlement with endemic malaria transmission in Brazil, (b) periurban villages in Peru that became recently exposed to epidemic malaria, and (c) gold-mining enclaves in Peru with explosive malaria outbreaks due to P. vivax. The field-based clinical and epidemiological analysis will be complemented with measurements of immunological parameters, extensive parasite genotyping and experimental infections of mosquitoes through membrane-feeding assays, providing a unique multidisciplinary perspective on the public health significance of asymptomatic parasite carriage in the Amazon Basin. Of crucial importance, the infrastructure and the data resulting from seven years of active malaria surveillance in the field sites will establish the bases for the vector biology and pathogenesis components of this proposal and for implementing future malaria vaccine trials in the Amazon region.  RELEVANCE: At a time when eradication is advocated as the ultimate goal of malaria control strategies worldwide, it remains unclear why malaria proved so difficult to control in areas of relatively low levels of transmission across the Amazon Basin. We hypothesize that asymptomatic infections may represent a major reservoir of parasites in this region, which is not addressed by traditional malaria control strategies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is the establishment the  Centro Latino Americano de investigacion en Malaria - CLAIM  as a non-Amazonian malaria research center that would generate knowledge and provide technical and scientific support to governments of the partner countries as well as to organizations and health care institutions to further contribute to malaria elimination programs in the regions. CLAIM would initially bring together field sites from Colombia, Peru, Panama and Guatemala, and has plans to further include sites from Ecuador and Honduras and possibly other endemic countries of the Latin American (LA) and the Caribbean such as Haiti. CLAIM will be composed of multiple public and private research centers from the original partner countries, including centers and organizations depending from or associated to the Ministries of Health (MOH) from all participant countries. CLAIM has also involved consultants/collaborators from the Andean Health Organism and/or the US Centers for Disease Control for this ICEMR program. In addition, to the scientists from the partner countries, CLAIM will have the participation of prominent and experienced scientists from other endemic countries such as Ecuador and Brazil, as well as from United State (USA) and Europe. The ICEMR research activities have been divided into three closely inter-related projects as follows: Project 1 on Epidemiology will determine the ecological and epidemiological features in non-Amazonian regions; Project 2 on malaria transmission will address major gaps in our understanding of the ecology, behavior, vector potential, and control of Anopheles malaria vectors to guide the development and implementation of more effective integrated Vector Management (IVM) strategies, and Project 3 on malaria pathogenesis, that it will determine the clinical outcome of malaria infections and its correlation with the immunological status in communities living under different intensifies of malaria transmission in the study region. CLAIM would involve its epidemiology team to closely work with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) of all partner countries, to locate and track the  hot spots  and to assess the changing epidemiological conditions, identifying the malaria patterns and establishing linkages with environmental and anthropogenic factors or other determinants of malaria transmission. The study team will provide technical assistance for helping NMCPs improve surveillance operations, including quality control and assurance of data with respect to diagnostics. This ICEMR proposal includes training activities for selected junior scientists and groups of researchers/technicians. Special projects will be initiated by Year 3 of the program and will profit to redirect the program and/or involve other countries. A Data Management (DM) Core will coordinate all research protocol, DM, data analyses and publications. All CLAIM activities will be coordinated by Core A under responsibility of Caucaseco SRC. CLAIM will combine the multidisciplinary and integrated approach to enhance the research underpinnings for effective malaria elimination and possibly eradication. Data and findings generated by this Center are expected to provide input critical to inform future research design and evaluation of new interventions and control strategies.  RELEVANCE: This is a comprehensive project designed to establish an international Center of Excellence for Malaria Research in Latin America (CLAIM) composed of multiple public and private research centers from the endemic countries, the USA and Europe working jointly to find alternatives for malaria control. Results will facilitate malaria elimination in low malaria endemic settings.   PROJECT 1: Title: Epidemiology of Malaria Transmission in Low to Moderate Settings of Latin America Project Leader: Herrera, S.  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of Project 1 is to evaluate the diversity of the ecology and parasite populations related to the epidemiology and clinical findings in order to establish a scientific framework that supports the development of new intervention strategies for malaria elimination in non-Amazonian areas of LA. This goal will be approached through the following specific aims: 1) Study the epidemiology of seasonal malaria and their relationship with parasite population diversity and 2) Identification of risk factors associated with malaria transmission in non-Amazonian areas of LA countries.  We hypothesize that circulating Plasmodium populations and their dynamics modulate the clinical manifestations and immune responses in the affected populations and that vector bionomics, parasite population diversity, host biology and behavior, household conditions, and local environmental conditions, act simultaneously to determine malaria transmission and risk of infection. The studies proposed for aim 1 are directed to determine the real prevalence and incidence of malaria by considering both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals living in seasonal areas in LA.  This investigation includes community based cohort studies (prospective studies), active surveillance using temporal cross-sectional studies, and hospital based passive surveillance studies. The studies will be carried out in 7 endemic areas of Colombia, Peru, Panama and Guatemala, where a total of 21 sentinel sites will be studied. Studies will be carried out in three phases: 1) Our own census of the selected population from sentinel sites where inhabitants will be registered using a demographic questionnaire and houses coordinates using a GPS system; 2) thick smear and PCR for malaria diagnose in selected sentinels sites and random sampling in order to determine asymptomatic gametocytes carriers; 3) clinical follow-up and thick smear of asymptomatic at two sentinel sites (one in Colombia (Tierralta) and one in Peru (Sulluna). For aim 2 we will a) assess the conditions of antimalarial use in communities where malaria is endemic, including adherence, self-medication and prophylaxis; and (b) study the conditions of use of antimalarials in the public and private health institutions including the availability and suitability to care guides. In this ICEMR program, we will establish a network of sentinel sites that will be selected integrating bio-geographic criteria (vector and ecological conditions) and epidemiological information. Sentinel sites will provide baseline information on malaria ecology and epidemiology with the goal of characterizing parasite and vector populations resilient to control interventions. Such network will allow supporting current efforts directed to develop population models to quantify disease dynamics and malaria risk-maps to support MOH elimination activities.  RELEVANCE: Identify the relationship between environmental factors, parasite characteristics, household conditions and the malaria prevalence related to the epidemiology and clinical findings.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is a major cause of vision loss worldwide. The long term goal of this competitive renewal application is to develop an effective vaccine that will produce protective immunity against ocular herpes. Natural HSV-1 immunity does not efficiently protect against recurrent infections or new infections, suggesting that an effective vaccine will have to induce different and/or more vigorous immune responses than the sub-optimal natural immunity. The research in this application will specifically focus on:(1) Identifying human HSV-1 epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from individuals with high (symptomatic) and no (asymptomatic) recurrent herpes disease. (2) Using asymptomatic epitopes only to design a powerful  protective  T cell based herpes vaccine. During the initial funding cycle (2003-2009) and one year of ARRA funding (2009-2010), we have discovered that some HSV-1 gB and gD epitopes were strongly recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic patients but not from symptomatic patients, while other gB and gD epitopes were strongly recognized by T-cells from symptomatic but not from asymptomatic patients (P<0.005). Lack of strong response is not due to clonal deletion of an epitope specific TCR, since the response is not missing, it is just much lower. We obtained proof-of-principle that intranasal immunization of double transgenic mice expressing both class 1 and class 2 Human Leukocyte Antigens (i.e. HLA-DR and HLA-A2.1) with  asymptomatic  CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes linked to a lipid moiety (lipopeptides), but not with  symptomatic  CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes, induced strong local HSV-specific T cells and provided protection against ocular challenge with HSV-1. Besides, gB and gD, HSV-1 tegument proteins VP11/12 and VP13/14 are also major targets for effector T cells. These intriguing results, together with relate reports by others in the field, lead us to hypothesize that: (1) Some HSV-1 epitopes are recognized differently by T cells from symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals. (2) Some epitopes recognized only by T cells from symptomatic individuals are pathogenic ( symptomatic epitopes ); whereas some epitopes recognized only by T cells from asymptomatic individuals are protective ( asymptomatic epitopes ). Our Specific Aims include: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that, although most HSV-1 epitopes are recognized by both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, there are human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes from gB, gD, VP11/12 and VP13/14 that are strongly recognized only by asymptomatic patients or only by symptomatic patients; Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that immunization with a combination of multiple  asymptomatic  epitopes from gB, gD, VP11/12 and VP13/14, will increase the magnitude, breadth and duration of T-cell protective immunity. A vaccine that incorporates only asymptomatic HSV-1 human T-cell epitopes and excludes symptomatic epitopes is a novel approach that should break new ground in our understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying ocular herpes disease and may ultimately lead to an effective vaccine.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 100 million individuals in the US are infected by HSV-1 and approximately 450,000 adults have a history of recurrent ocular disease that can cause loss of vision. This competitive renewal application for an R01 research grant is to identify epitopes specifically recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from individuals with high (symptomatic) and low (asymptomatic) recurrent ocular herpes disease. The information will be used to design a powerful T cell-based lipopeptide vaccine against ocular herpes.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery results in neurological problems. Inflammatory cytokines in the plaque induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thus thinning the fibrous cap and resulting in plaque destabilization and rupture. During the initial funding cycle, we made novel observations that IGF-1 is more potent in inducing the survival of VSMCs in carotid endarterectomy tissues of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. Also, atheroma-associated cytokines decrease IGF-1-induced survival and proliferation of VSMCs. In our follow-up studies we observed specific differences in the profile of dendritic cells (DCs), T-regulatory cells, and NPY and NPY receptors in symptomatic (unstable) and asymptomatic (stable) plaques. Also, stronger immunoreactivity of Foxp3, IL-10 and CD25 with preponderance of CD4? T cells in carotid plaques of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. IGF-1 increased mRNA transcripts of NPY-Y2 and NPY-Y5 receptors in asymptomatic but not in symptomatic plaque SMCs. These novel findings suggest a cell-mediated immune response in carotid plaques which is regulated by NPY. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammation in the carotid plaque is modulated by interaction of NPY with DCs and T cells leading to increased inflammation and apoptosis of VSMCs in carotid plaques of symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis, and that atheroma-associated cytokines modulate NPY receptors and their function in VSMCs of carotid plaques. In Aim 1, we will examine the phenotypes of dendritic cells and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules in DCs in the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. In Aim 2, we will examine the phenotype of T-regulatory cells (inducible CD4? T-regs and naturally-occurring CD4???? T-regs) and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of the receptors for co-stimulatory molecules (PD-1, CTLA- 4) in T-regs from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. We will also determine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of atheroma-associated cytokines, on the differentiation of naive T cells into T-regulatory cells. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of inflammatory cytokines, on the survival and apoptosis of VSMCs isolated from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the instability and rupture of carotid plaques in patients with carotid stenosis. Such investigations would provide unique insights to the pathophysiologic process of neurological diseases associated with the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and the means to prevent the disease in patients with carotid stenosis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many patients with blockade of their neck artery develop neurological symptoms including transient ischemic attack or stroke. This is primarily due to breaking off the atherosclerotic plaque in the neck artery. In this project experiments are proposed to examine the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the plaque rupture. Information obtained from this study should provide an opportunity to formulate superior therapeutic approaches in the prevention of stroke.',\n",
       " '7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTHeart failure (HF) is a major public health concern, affecting more than 5.5 million Americans, with over550,000 new cases diagnosed each year, and accounting for up to 10% of all hospital admissions. Depressionis the most robust behavioral predictor of morbidity and premature mortality among patients with symptomaticHF, with an incidence ranging from 20% to 45%, depending on HF severity. Our ongoing project HL-073355 isexamining the pathophysiology associated with depression in HF patients. Few studies have systematicallyexamined the development and progression of depression concurrent with the development of and progressionto symptomatic HF and its associated neuroimmune and behavioral mechanisms. By enrolling individuals atrisk for developing symptomatic HF but who are currently asymptomatic, namely American College ofCardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Stage B patients, this competing renewal of HL-073355will prospectively track the incidence and time course of depressive symptoms and Major Depressive Disorder(MDD), the development of symptomatic HF, potential neuroimmune and behavioral mechanisms linking HFand MDD, and associations with cardiovascular clinical outcomes. We will enroll 522 high-risk (defined as BNP>100pg/ml) ACC/AHA Stage B patients, study them at intake, and every 6 months for an average of 30months. Through our strong collaborations with the HF teams at the University of California, San Diego(UCSD) Hillcrest and La Jolla Medical Centers, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System(VASDHS) in La Jolla, we have access to a large number of asymptomatic Stage B patients. Clinicalassessments will include echocardiography and characterization of depressive symptoms by the BeckDepression Inventory (BDI) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID). Neuroimmuneassessments will include circulating levels of BNP, CRP, TNF-¿, IL-1¿, IL-6, sICAM-1, sP-selectin,catecholamines, and functional assessments of leukocytes. In addition to depression, other behavioral andpsychosocial assessments will include sleep, health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity),psychosocial stressors, coping, anxiety, social network, and quality of life. Clinical outcomes will includetransition from asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction to symptomatic Stages C and/or D HF, clinical cardiovascularoutcomes (combined hospitalizations for cardiovascular events and/or death), and the development orrecurrence of MDD. Findings from this prospective study have the potential to add new insights into how MDDmight contribute to HF progression at early stages of the disease. A greater understanding of the role andmechanisms by which MDD may impact HF at this stage could support clinically relevant early MDDintervention efforts at a point when effective depression treatment could have a potentially greater impact onthe course of HF.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transcription factor Nrf2 has emerged as a master regulator of a cellular protective mechanism by upregulating antioxidant response element (ARE)-bearing genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, and stress response proteins. Keap1, a substrate adaptor protein for a Cullin3 (Cul3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, tightly regulates the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is constantly targeted for Keap1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation to maintain a low constitutive level in al human organs. Upon activation of the pathway, the enzymatic activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2 downstream genes. Since the discovery of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway in 1999, Nrf2 has been viewed as a  good  transcription factor that protects us from oxidative stress-related diseases, including cancer. The chemopreventive property of Nrf2 has been well documented by the following two facts: (i) many of the well- studied chemopreventive compounds elicit their activities through activation of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway, and (ii) Nrf2-null mice are highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and are no longer protected by chemopreventive compounds. Paradoxically, the  dark side  of Nrf2 has recently been revealed. For instance, somatic mutations that disrupt the Keap1-mediated negative regulation of Nrf2, resulting in a high constitutive level of Nrf2, have been identified in several types of tumors and cancer cel lines, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Furthermore, mounting evidence has emerged, indicating that Nrf2 contributes to chemoresistance, the major obstacle in cancer treatment. The discovery of the  dark side  of Nrf2 has clearly illustrated the urgent need to identify Nrf2 inhibitors and develop them into druggable compounds to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. We have screened a large number of natural products for their inhibition of ARE-luciferase activity using a stable cell line established in our lab, MDA-MB-231-ARE-Luc, containing an ARE (from GST-Ya)-dependent luciferase gene. Using this method, we have identified a plant extract that is able to inhibit ARE-luciferase activity. Furthermore, a pure compound, brusatol, has been isolated from the extract and has been found to inhibit the protein level of Nrf2 and exhibit potent anti-cancer activities. So far, we have obtained a substantial amount of preliminary data demonstrating that brusatol sensitizes several cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and, more significantly, brusatol sensitizes lung cancer xenografts to cisplatin in vivo in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Based on the ability of brusatol to specifically inhibit Nrf2 and sensitize cultured cancer cells and xenografts to cisplatin treatments, we hypothesize that brusatol can enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through inhibition of the Nrf2-dependant protective mechanism. The goal of the proposed research is to further characterize the anti-cancer properties of brusatol using a preclinical lung cancer model and delineate the molecular targets and mechanistic actions of brusatol. The proposed study will not only provide a framework for the development of this Nrf2 inhibitor into a therapeutic drug to combat chemoresistance, but also provide the first Nrf2 inhibitor for basic research in the field, both of which will have profound impacts on human health worldwide. Therefore, the following three aims will be pursued: Aim #1. Characterize the mechanistic actions of brusatol-mediated Nrf2 inhibition Nrf2 is primarily regulated by the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase at the protein level through ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, we will investigate the effects of brusatol on the proteins that may enhance the activity of the E3 ligase, such as the protein subunits of the E3 ligase, as well as regulatory proteins that control the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the ligase complex. Aim #2. Determine the molecular targets of brusatol The target proteins of brusatol will be identified and verified. The biological functions of these proteins, in particular their crosstalk with the Nrf2 signaling pathway, wil be investigated. Most likely, these proteins will directly or indirectly regulate the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase. Aim #3. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of brusatol using an LSL-KrasG12D/+ mouselung cancer model The feasibility of using brusatol as an adjuvant to enhance current cancer treatments and to combat both intrinsic and acquired resistance will be tested in this preclinical model that recapitulates the development and progression of human lung cancer. !  !',\n",
       " 'Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease is essential for viral replication andhas proved a very effective target for antiviral drugs to treat AIDS. But, the long termeffectiveness of current AIDS therapy is confronted by the major challenge of rapiddevelopment of drug-resistant HIV. Multiple mutations accumulate in the protease inresponse to inhibitor therapy and produce resistance. The overall goal is to develop newantiviral protease inhibitors and therapeutic strategies to overcome the problem of drug-resistance. The overarching hypothesis is that improved knowledge of the molecularmechanisms for HIV resistance to protease inhibitors will aid in development of potent newtherapeutic agents to combat drug resistant virus. Our kinetic and structural analysis hasshown that protease mutations can produce inhibitor resistance by several mechanisms,including lower affinity for inhibitor due to mutations that alter the inhibitor binding site, andaltered protease stability due to mutations that alter the dimer interface. The central designstrategy is that inhibitors with improved polar interactions with conserved regions of HIVprotease will be potent drugs for resistant HIV. Our analysis of HIV protease-inhibitorstructures has demonstrated the importance of the conserved set of hydrogen bondinteractions between main chain atoms of peptide analogs and the protease backboneatoms. Our crystallographic analysis shows that the earlier clinical inhibitors have fewer ofthese polar interactions and high affinity is achieved by van der Waals interactions withprotease side chains, leading to sensitivity to mutations in the binding site. The new antiviralinhibitor darunavir (TMC114; UIC-94017) was designed and confirmed to include morehydrogen bonds with protease main chain atoms. Darunavir showed fewer changes thanother clinical inhibitors on the structures and activities of mutant proteases, resulting in highpotency, excellent resistance profile, and approval for AIDS salvage therapy in June 2006.Our design strategy was further verified by analysis of the antiviral inhibitors GRL-06579Aand GRL-98065. The appearance of new resistance mutations, diverse mechanisms ofresistance and adverse side effects of drugs necessitate the development of new non-peptideinhibitors to expand the repertoire and potency of antiviral agents for resistant HIV. Thisresearch integrates in vitro analysis of the crystal structures and enzymatic activities of HIVprotease mutants, chemical synthesis, and antiviral studies in HIV-infected cells to designnovel protease inhibitors in the combat against resistant HIV.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classifying disease stage and elucidating a prognosis, which allow the most effective medical intervention, are unattainable when the underlying pathological changes, or the correlates of stage and prognosis, are associated with heterogeneous cells states within a larger population. Single cell analyses can provide an unsurpassed means to measure and unravel heterogeneity in complex biological systems, and thereby to understand the basis for (or to identify correlates of) changes in biological function and disease processes. Here we propose to develop a rapid assay for detection of antigen-specific responses in single T cells from small amounts of blood, based on state-of-the-art techniques that are sensitive and robust. Our proposal aims at developing a test that provides tuberculosis (TB) diagnosticians with the critical ability to distinguish stable latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (when the asymptomatic subject is not progressing to disease, is not infectious, and does not require treatment) from preclinical disease (when the asymptomatic subject is developing disease, is still not infectious, and requires early treatment to block progression of disease and drastically curb transmission of infection). Our multidisciplinary team includes expertise in development of novel single cell analysis methodology, cellular immunology, and biomarker research for TB, which still causes millions of cases of disease and death worldwide every year. Our assay is expected to yield multi-parameter measurements of single T cell functional states by integrating (i) use of artificial Ag-presenting cells (aAPC) to activate T cell receptor signaling and stimulation of gene expression, with (ii) measurement of inducible tell-tale markers of T cell activation and function by quantitative flow cytometry. Induced gene expression will be detected by mRNA enumeration using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). The research plan is articulated in four aims, each focused on the development of a specific aspect of the assay: (1) read-out: detection of activation markers in single T cells by smFISH and flow cytometry following conventional stimulation; (2) stimulation: response to aAPC assessed by detection of activation markers in single T cells; (3) response to infection-stage-specific Ag: association of single T cell responses with disease vs asymptomatic infection; (4) infection-stage-specific functional T cell signatures: multi-parameter characterization of single T cell responses and association with disease vs asymptomatic infection. The proposed plan should lead to recognizing and treating active TB prior to the appearance of microbiological and clinical signs and symptoms of disease. This is the current holy grail in TB diagnosis as it is considered to be critical to TB elimination efforts. The new assay principles will be translatable for diagnosis anddisease staging of any pathology with T cell involvement, including other infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmunity, and transplantation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful intervention in many diseases is often severely limited by insufficient understanding of the complex underlying pathology. In particular, the ability to classify the disease stage and to elucidate a prognosis may be poor or even impossible when pathological changes are identifiable only in a small number of cells within a larger population. Here we propose to develop a new immunological test that can identify, from among persons carrying an asymptomatic infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria that cause tuberculosis), those individuals progressing toward disease and becoming infectious. Two billion people (about one-third of the world's population) are currently infected with the TB bacteria, with the highest concentration of new cases in resource-poor areas of South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Even though 90-95% of infected persons do not become sick, the number of infected individuals is high enough to give rise to 8 million new cases of TB and almost 2 million deaths each year worldwide. Existing blood-based clinical immunodiagnostic assays recognize TB infection but are not geared to distinguish between asymptomatic infection and active disease. The latter is currently identified only when patients excrete TB bacilli while coughing or sneezing (it is estimated that, by the time of diagnosis, a person with active TB has already infected up to twenty contacts). Thus, for public health purposes, it is critical to diagnose active disease when the patient is still asymptomatic and non-infectious. We propose to develop a new, rapid test requiring small amounts of blood that detects tell-tale immune cell subpopulations distinguishing the relevant groups. The detection method in this test requires basic flow cytometry, a technique routinely utilized in the clinical diagnosis of immunopathologies and fully accessible to district/peripheral level clinical laboratories that currently operate a fluorescence microscope in resource-poor regions. Translation of the proposed diagnostic methodology to clinical practice will allow identification and treatment of early cases of TB, thus impeding transmission and helping eliminate TB. While the present proposal is directed to a specific set of end-users in TB clinics, the proposed assay has broad public health relevance, because the same principles and methodologies are directly applicable to any infectious and non-infectious disease that can be characterized based on the properties of single immune cells involved in the body's recognition of or response to a particular condition.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the near-universal skepticism that initially greeted Folkman's presentation of his idea that anti-angiogenesis would be an effective approach to cancer chemotherapy, this concept has now become widely accepted and forms a basis not only for cancer therapy, but also for therapy of a broad range of non-neoplastic disorders that Folkman summarizes under the term 'angiogenesis-dependent diseases'. Currently approved therapies, directed against the central bodily chemical involved in angiogenesis, VEGF, are useful, but not entirely safe or effective. We propose to develop new anti-VEGF agents through discovery by powerful phage display methods, and to apply these new agents as a forthcoming generation of safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors. Our specific aims are: (i) to discover and develop new anti-angiogenic peptidomimetic compounds targeting the VEGF receptor family, and (ii) to design and test new agents for therapeutic control of retinal angiogenesis. These agents would both bind selectively to pathological new blood vessels and block or destroy them, without affecting normal blood vessels. Our goal is to understand and inhibit pathological angiogenesis in the neural retina of experimental mouse models of human blindness-causing diseases.\",\n",
       " 'Members of the APOBEC3 family of deoxycytidine deaminases counteract a broad range of retroviruses in vitro through an indirect mechanism that requires virion incorporation and inhibition of reverse transcription and/or hypermutation of minus strand transcripts in the next target cell. The selective advantage to the host of this indirect restriction mechanism remains unclear, but valuable insights may be gained by studying APOBEC3 function in vivo. Apobec3 was previously shown to encode Rfv3, a classical resistance gene that controls the recovery of mice from pathogenic Friend retrovirus (FV) infection by promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response. The underlying mechanism does not involve a direct effect of Apobec3 on B cell function. Here we show that while Apobec3 decreased titers of infectious virus during acute FV infection, plasma viral RNA loads were maintained, indicating substantial release of noninfectious particles in vivo. The lack of plasma virion infectivity was associated with a significant post-entry block during early reverse transcription rather than G-to-A hypermutation. The Apobec3-dependent NAb response correlated with IgG binding titers against native, but not detergent-lysed virions. These findings indicate that innate Apobec3 restriction promotes NAb responses by maintaining high concentrations of virions with native B cell epitopes, but in the context of low virion infectivity. Finally, Apobec3 restriction was found to be saturable in vivo, since increasing FV inoculum doses resulted in decreased Apobec3 inhibition. By analogy, maximizing the release of noninfectious particles by modulating APOBEC3 expression may improve humoral immunity against pathogenic human retroviral infections.B cells are one of the targets of Friend virus (FV) infection, a well-established mouse model often used to study retroviral infections in vivo. Although B cells may be effective in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, studies involving their role in FV infection have mainly focused on neutralizing antibody production. Here we show that polyclonal activation of B cells promotes their infection with FV both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that complement opsonization of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) enhances infection of B cells, which correlates with increased potency of B cells to activate FV-specific CD8(+) T cells.Antibody prevalence studies in laboratory mice indicate that murine norovirus (MNV) infections are common, but the natural history of these viruses has not been fully established. This study examined the extent of genetic diversity of murine noroviruses isolated from healthy laboratory mice housed in multiple animal facilities within a single, large research institute- the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIAID-NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. Ten distinct murine norovirus strains were isolated from various tissues and feces of asymptomatic wild type sentinel mice as well as asymptomatic immunodeficient (RAG 2(-/-)) mice. The NIH MNV isolates showed little cytopathic effect in permissive RAW264.7 cells in early passages, but all isolates examined could be adapted to efficient growth in cell culture by serial passage. The viruses, although closely related in genome sequence, were distinguishable from each other according to facility location, likely due to the introduction of new viruses into each facility from separate sources or vendors at different times. Our study indicates that the murine noroviruses are widespread in these animal facilities, despite rigorous guidelines for animal care and maintenance.Prion diseases are fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. An abnormally protease-resistant and insoluble form (PrP(Sc)) of the normally soluble protease-sensitive host prion protein (PrP(C)) is the major component of the infectious prion. During the course of prion disease, PrP(Sc) accumulates primarily in the lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. Recent studies have shown that co-infection of prion-infected fibroblast cells with the Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) strongly enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture, suggesting that retroviral coinfection might significantly influence prion spread and disease incubation times in vivo. We now show that another retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus Friend (F-MuLV), also enhanced the release and spread of scrapie infectivity in cell culture. However, peripheral co-infection of mice with both Friend virus and the mouse scrapie strain 22L did not alter scrapie disease incubation times, the levels of PrP(Sc) in the brain or spleen, or the distribution of pathological lesions in the brain. Thus, retroviral co-infection does not necessarily alter prion disease pathogenesis in vivo, most likely because of different cell-specific sites of replication for scrapie and F-MuLV.It was recently reported that inhibitory molecules such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) were upregulated on CD8(+) T cells during acute Friend retrovirus infection and that the cells were prematurely exhausted and dysfunctional in vitro. The current study confirms that most activated CD8(+) T cells upregulated expression of PD-1 during acute infection and revealed a dichotomy of function between PD-1(hi) and PD-1(lo) subsets. More PD-1(lo) cells produced antiviral cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas more PD-1(hi) cells displayed characteristics of cytotoxic effectors such as production of granzymes and surface expression of CD107a. Importantly, CD8(+) T cells mediated rapid in vivo cytotoxicity and were critical for control of acute Friend virus replication. Thus, direct ex vivo analyses and in vivo experiments revealed high CD8(+) T cell functionality and indicate that PD-1 expression during acute infection is not a marker of T cell exhaustion.',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have completed a number of sudies in the pathogenesis of lymphatic filarial disease and the immune responses in  pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, we have begun two new studies to examine the influence of filarial infections on latent tuberculosis and the immunological responses in tuberculous lymphadenitis.Lymphatic filariasis (LF) pathogenesis:    Lymphatic filariasis can be associated with development of serious pathology in the form of lymphedema, hydrocele, and elephantiasis in a subset of infected patients. Dysregulated host inflammatory responses leading to systemic immune activation are thought to play a central role in filarial disease pathogenesis. We measured the plasma levels of microbial translocation markers, acute phase proteins, and inflammatory cytokines in individuals with chronic filarial pathology with (CP Ag+) or without (CP Ag) active infection; with clinically asymptomatic infections (INF); and in those without infection (endemic normal EN). Comparisons between the two actively infected groups (CP Ag+ compared to INF) and those without active infection (CP Ag compared to EN) were considered to truly reflect markers of pathogenesis. Our data suggest that circulating levels of microbial translocation products (lipopolysaccharide and LPS-binding protein), acute-phase proteins (haptoglobin, a-2 macroglobulin, and serum amyloid protein-A), and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-12, and TNF-a) are associated with pathogenesis of disease in lymphatic filarial infection and implicate an important role for circulating microbial products and acute phase proteins in establishing the chronic inflammatory milieu in this process.      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes governing extracellular remodeling by regulating cellular homeostasis, inflammation, and tissue reorganization, while tissue-inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are endogenous regulators of MMPs. Homeostatic as well as inflammation-induced balance between MMPs and TIMPs is considered critical in mediating tissue pathology. To elucidate the role of MMPs and TIMPs in filarial pathology, we compared the plasma levels of a panel of MMPs, TIMPs, other pro-fibrotic factors, and cytokines in individuals with chronic filarial pathology with (CP Ag+) or without (CP Ag) active infection to those with clinically asymptomatic infections (INF) and in those without infection (endemic normal EN). Our data reveal that an increase in circulating levels of MMPs and TIMPs is characteristic of the filarial disease process per se and not of active infection; however, filarial disease with active infection is specifically associated with increased ratios of MMP1/TIMP4 and MMP8/TIMP4 as well as with pro-fibrotic cytokines (IL-5, IL-13 and TGF-b). Our data therefore suggest that while filarial lymphatic disease is characterized by a non-specific increase in plasma MMPs and TIMPs, the balance between MMPs and TIMPs is an important factor in regulating tissue pathology during active infection.      Lymphatic filarial disease is known to be associated with elevated Th1 and normal or diminished Th2 responses to parasite-specific antigens. The role of Th17 cells and T cells expressing the IL-10 family of cytokines, however, has not been well-defined nor has the contribution of CD8+ T cells to this cytokine response. To study the role of CD4+ and CD8+ Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell subsets as well as T cells expressing IL-10 family of cytokines in the development of lymphatic pathology, we examined the frequency of these cells in individuals with filarial lymphedema (CP) directly ex vivo and in response to parasite or non-parasite antigens; these frequencies were compared to those in clinically asymptomatic patently-infected individuals (INF). CP individuals exhibited a significant increase in the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2, TNF-a, IFNg, IL-17 and IL-22 at baseline and in response to filarial antigens compared to INF individuals. In contrast, these same individuals exhibited a significant decrease in the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13 and IL-21. In addition, CP individuals displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing IL-10, IL-19 and IL-24 but not IL-26. These differential frequencies between the 2 patient groups were also observed in CD8+ T cells, albeit to a much less extent. Our findings suggest that alterations in the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ Th1, Th2, Th17 cells and T cells expressing IL-10 family of cytokines are a characteristic feature underlying the pathogenesis of filarial lymphedema.Tuberculosis Studies     Although Type 1 cytokine responses are known to play an important role in immunity to tuberculosis (TB), very little is know about the role of Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines in TB disease pathogenesis. To elucidate the immune responses important both in control of infection and in extrapulmonary dissemination, we examined mycobacteriaspecific cytokine responses in pulmonary TB (PTB) (n=26) and extrapulmonary TB (ETB) (n=24) and compared them with latently infected individuals (LTB) (n=24). Multiplex ELISA (IFNg, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-12, GM-CSF, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-6, IL-17, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23, IL-10 and TGF-b) was carried out using culture supernatants of whole blood stimulated with TB antigens  PPD, ESAT-6, CFP-10 and control  anti-CD3. We observed significantly lower levels of Type 1 cytokines (IFNg, TNF-a, IL-2 and GM-CSF), 2 (IL-4), and 17 (IL-17A and IL-17F) -associated cytokines at baseline, as well as after stimulation with TB antigens in PTB compared to LTB, indicating that these cytokines play an important role in protection against disease. In addition, PTB showed markedly diminished production of Types 1 (IFNg, TNF-a, IL-2 and GM-CSF), 2 (IL-4), and 17 (IL-17A and IL-17F) -associated cytokines at baseline and following TB antigenic stimulation in comparison to ETB. This was associated with significantly altered production of IL-10 and TGF-b in PTB. Treatment and consequent bacteriological cure did not reverse the downregulation in cytokine responses. However, both IL-10 and TGF-b blockade was able to partially reverse the dimunition in cytokine responses, indicating an important regulatory role for these cytokines in PTB. Thus, Pulmonary TB is characterized by diminished Types 1, 2 and 17 cytokine responses, suggesting a crucial role for these cytokines in protection against TB disease development as well as extra-pulmonary dissemination.     Th1 and Th17 responses are known to play an important role in immunity to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), although little is known about their role in extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis (TB). To identify the role of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in multi-focal TB lymphadenitis (TBL), we examined mycobacteriaspecific immune responses in the whole blood of individuals with PTB (n = 20) and compared them with those with TBL (n = 25). Elevated frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing IFNg, TNF-a, and IL-2 were present in individuals with TBL compared with those with PTB at homeostasis (baseline) as well as in response to mycobacterial antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Similarly, increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing IL-17A, IL-17F, and IFNg were also present in individuals with TBL at baseline and following ESAT-6 and CFP-10 stimulation although no significant difference in the Th1 (but not Th17) cells exhibited a significantly negative correlation with natural regulatory T cell frequencies at baseline. Multi-focal TB lymphadenitis is therefore, characterized by elevated frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells, indicating that Th1 and Th17 responses in TB disease are probably correlates of disease severity rather than of protective immunity.',\n",

       " 'This protocol is designed to study the natural history and epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in an asymptomatic blood donor population. Thus far, 738 subjects have been analyzed, including 469 recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) positives, 52 RIBA indeterminates, and 217 RIBA-negative controls. The 15 year follow-up of the cohort was published this year(JID 2012:206:654). Interesteing epidemiologc findings include the high  proportion (41 percent) of RIBA+ donors who admitted to prior (remote) intravenous drug use and the strong independent association between cocaine snorting and HCV positivity. Shared paraphernalia for snorting accompanied by epistaxis, may serve as a covert vehicle for parenteral viral transmission. Among anti-HCV+/RIBA-positive donors, 82 percent were persistently viremic, but 18 percent appeared to have recovered from prior HCV infection. A liver biopsy has been obtained from 185(47%)patients who were chronically infected; 51% had mild chronic hepatitis and 44% had moderate chronic hepatitis; despite a mean duration of infection of 20 years,only 5% had severe inflammation. No fibrosis was observed in 33% of biopsied patients and 52% had only mild fibrosis; 15 had more severe fibrosis including 12% with bridging fibrosis and 2% with cirrhosis. Overall, HCV infection in this cohort was generally asymptomatic and clinically benign. Despite an association of HCV with sexually promiscuous practices, we found no evidence for sexual transmission to the specific partners of 165 HCV-infected individuals. The study continues to follow the natural history HCV infection and is now focusing on histologic progression as assessed in liver biopsies obtained at 5-year intervals. New emphasis is being placed on studies of cell-mediated immune responses to HCV and of treatment responses.',\n",
       " 'In 2002 we reported the occurrence of avascular necrosis of bone (usually the hip) in 15 asymptomatic patients with HIV disease. We have continued to follow these asymptomatic patients, and have also enrolled a cohort of approximately 40 patients with symptomatic osteonecrosis.  This includes patients who were being followed in our clinic as well as patients referred from community physicians.  The occurrence of pain and functional disability is being assessed, with the primary endpoint being the time to joint replacement.  The radiographic evolution of hip lesions is also being evaluated by yearly MRIs.  In 2007, we published a summary of our experiences describing the incidence of osteonecrosis in our clinic population as well as the proportion of patients that needed to go on to surgical repair/joint replacement.  We found that most asymptomatic patients remained asymptomatic, though a small proportin developed symptoms and needed hip replacement.  We also found that among patients with symptomatic ostoenecrosis, the median time to hip replacement was under one year.  We recently found that D-dimer and hsCRP, important markers of inflammation in  HIV-infected patients, were significantly higher in patients with osteonecrosis compared to an HIV-infected control population at the time of diagnosis as well as approximately 6 months later, and that hsCRP was also elevated approximately 6 months prior to the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, suggesting that ongoing inflammation is a risk factor that may contribute to the development of osteonecrosis.  The latter study has been submitted for publication.  We are continuing to enroll patients with symptomatic disease and to follow these patients long term, as it is one of the largest such cohorts being followed.  This type of long-term follow-up is necessary in order to determine the long term natural history and clinical relevance of findings.',\n",
       " 'Obesity is a huge and increasing medical problem, with inadequate therapeutic options.  One approach to the treatment of obesity is long-term pharmacotherapy.  While only one modestly effective drug marketed in the United States (orlistat), two drugs have recently been approved by the FDA (lorcaserin, Qsymia).  The limited efficacy of single agents has lead to the idea that combination therapy will be required.  We are currently designing animal protocols that will use mice to explore combination therapy for obesity.  A specific interest is the rational combination of a centrally (brain) acting drug with one that acts peripherally (outside of the brain). This approach has potential to allow use of lower doses of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, minimizing adverse effects while maintaining weight reduction efficacy, via targeting of both metabolic rate and food intake.',\n",
       " 'HIV protease inhibitors, such as, ritonavir and saquinavir, are substrates for xenobiotic efflux pumps, e.g., P-glycoprotein and Mrp2 and thus penetrate the blood-brain barrier poorly. To map the extracellular and intracellular signals that regulate these transporters, we use 1) pharmacological tools, 2) intact brain capillaries from rats and mice (including transgenics and knockouts), 2) fluorescent substrates, 3) confocal imaging to measure transport function, 4) Western blotting to measure transporter expression, and 5) brain perfusion in rats and mice to validate signaling-based changes in blood-brain barrier transporter function in vivo. Our recent studies have focused on identifying signals that modify pump activity in the barrier. These in vitro and in vivo experiments with animal models suggest two specific strategies for modifying this barrier to improve drug delivery, but also potentially important complications of polypharmacy related to xenobiotic upregulation of efflux transporter expression. One strategy for improving CNS delivery of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates involves activating protein kinase C (PKC) isoform beta1 or sphingolipid signaling at the blood-brain barrier. This causes a rapid and reversible reduction in basal P-glycoprotein transport activity in isolated brain capillaries and in intact rats. We have now identified a drug, Fingolimod (FTY720) currently in use in the clinic, that will target this signaling system and reduced P-glycoprotein tranport activity in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, such signaling increases brain uptake of drugs that are P-glycoprotein substrates. Thus, targeting signals that regulate basal activity of this transporter increases delivery of therapeutic drugs to the brain, including HIV protease inhibitors. A second strategy to improve HIV drug delivery to the CNS involves use of an innovative chemical strategy with the P-gp substrate and anti-viral agent, abacavir, in conjunction with a traceless tether. Dimeric prodrugs of abacavir were designed to have two functions: inhibit P-gp efflux at the BBB and revert to monomeric therapeutic within cellular reducing environments. The prodrug dimers are potent P-gp inhibitors in cell culture and in a brain capillary model of the BBB. Significantly, these agents demonstrate anti-HIV activity in two T-cell-based HIV assays, a result that is linked to cellular reversion of the prodrug to abacavir. This strategy represents a platform technology that may be applied to other therapies with limited brain penetration due to P-glycoprotein.',\n",
       " \"The objectives of this project, and related progress in the past year, are reviewed below.(1) Development of a reverse genetics system that can be used to modify the antigenicity and virulence of rotaviruses (RVs) and to develop new vaccine candidates. The RV genome consists of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. The positive-sense RNA of each segment typically contains short 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that flank a single open reading frame (ORF). Occasionally, individual RV genome segments undergo rearrangement due to partial head-to-tail duplication of a segment sequence. In most cases, rearrangements initiate after the stop codon, leaving the ORF and the encoded protein unaffected. During virus replication, naturally occurring segments with sequence rearrangement are preferentially packaged over wild-type segments. The mechanism for the improved-replication phenotype is unclear, but may be connected to duplication of RNA sequences involved in packaging of the RV genome. As an extension of these observations, we used reverse genetics to engineer duplications into the segment encoding NSP2. The duplications were 25, 50, 100 and 200 bases in length and were inserted into the 3' UTR of the NSP2 segment such that ORF was unaffected and retained the capacity to encode NSP2. Recombinant RVs containing the duplicated sequences grew to high titer and were genetically stable. They were, however, unable to compete with wild-type virus in mixed infections, suggesting that the location and /or length of the engineered sequence duplication did not provide for preferential packaging of the segment. These results indicate that sequence duplication alone (or increased segment length) is not the only factor responsible for enhancing the packaging activity of an RNA segment. Indeed, our work raises the possibility that many rearrangements that arise in vitro and in vivo go undetected and are eliminated from the virus population. (2) Elucidation of mechanisms that RV proteins use to antagonize the interferon signaling pathway. The RV nonstructural protein NSP1 inhibits the expression of type I interferon (IFN), thereby promoting viral spread. NSP1 is predicted to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase by inducing polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of the IFN-regulatory factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7. All IRF proteins share an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, while IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 contain a C-proximal IRF-association domain (IAD), which mediates dimerization. IRFs are maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm through an autoinhibitory domain that interacts with the IAD, burying key residues required for IRF dimerization and preventing IRF nuclear accumulation. C-terminal phosphorylation induces charge repulsions, causing the autoinhibitory domain to unmask the IAD, allowing formation of transcriptionally active IRF dimers. To identify the region of IRF proteins targeted for degradation by NSP1, we generated a series of IRF3 and IRF7 truncation mutants and co-expressed each with NSP1. We found that the IAD was necessary and sufficient for degradation by NSP1. Disruption of conserved residues required for dimerization of IRF3 did not interfere with NSP1-mediated degradation of the protein. Similarly, constitutively-expressed dimeric forms of IRF3 were targeted for degradation by NSP1. These results indicate that NSP1 recognizes the dimerization domain of both the monomeric and dimeric form of IRF proteins for degradation. The ability to target IRF proteins in both states suggests multiple steps of the IFN signaling pathway are targeted by NSP1, allowing for more efficient inhibition of IFN expression.(3) Analysis of the diversity and evolution of the RV genome: (a) Characterization of asymptomatic and symptomatic G10P11 RV Infections in Vellore, India, suggest a possible role of Aichi virus in diarrheal disease. Human G10P11 RVs causing symptomatic and asymptomatic infections have been described in neonates living in Vellore. Towards the goal of identifying possible genetic determinants responsible for the different phenotypes, the genomes of G10P11 viruses in stool samples from neonates/infants with asymptomatic infections (n=20) and with symptomatic infections (n=19) were recovered and analyzed using a combination of Sanger, 454, and Illumina sequencing methods. The results of RV sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed no differences in the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of G10P11 RVs associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. Surprisingly, deep sequencing revealed the presence of Aichi viral RNA in 2 of the 20 asymptomatic infections and 6 of the 19 symptomatic infections. These results indicate that genetic determinants are not responsible for differences in symptomatic and asymptomatic G10P11 RV infections. Our results raise the possibility that other infectious agents, such as Aichi virus, may be responsible for some diarrheal disease previously associated with symptomatic strains of G10P11 RV. (b) Increased incidence of G2P4 RV infections as Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) during 2010-2011 reveal distinct genotype 2 alleles. As part of the CDCs New Vaccine Surveillance Network, stool specimens were collected from infants and young children presenting with acute gastroenteritis at VUMC during the season preceding the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in the US and prospectively since. Most laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections at VUMC were caused by G1P8 rotaviruses during the 2005-06, 2006-07, and 2007-08 seasons and G3P8 strains during the 2008-09 season. Relative to the preceding years, an increase in rotavirus infections were noted for the 2010-11 season, for which G2P4 viruses were largely responsible (12 G2P4, 13 G3P8, 1 G9P8, 1 G12P8). To better understand the diversity and relationships of the G2P4 viruses, their genomes were sequenced. All the G2P4 viruses contained complete genotype 2 (DS1-like) constellations (I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2), indicating a lack of reassortment with more commonly circulating genotype 1 (Wa-like) viruses (I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1).  Phylogenetic analysis showed the genes of the G2P4 viruses could be resolved into at least two subgenotype alleles and most of the viruses could be resolved into either of two clades based on the conserved nature of their allele constellations. Our findings suggest, like G1P8 and G3P8 viruses, a limited amount of genetic exchange occurs between the G2P4 virus clades co-circulating in the same geographical location during the same year.(c) Vaccine-derived NSP2 segment in RV from vaccinated children with gastroenteritis in Nicaragua. The efficacy of RV vaccines can be low in developing countries. For example, a vaccine efficacy against severe diarrhea of only 58% was noted in a 2007-2009 Nicaraguan study with RotaTeq. To understand the basis of vaccine failure, the genomes of RVs isolated from vaccinated Nicaraguan children with gastroenteritis were sequenced. The results revealed that all the viruses had typical genotypes (11 G1P8, 1 G3P8) and that nine of the G1P8 viruses and the single G3P8 virus had genome constellations common to human RVs. However, two of the G1P8 viruses had atypical constellations, G1P8I1R1C1M1A1N2T1E1H1, due to the presence of a genotype-2 NSP2 (N2) gene. The sequence of the N2 NSP2 gene was identical to the RotaTeq N2 NSP2 gene, indicating that the two atypical viruses originated by reassortment of human G1P8 RVs with RotaTeq viruses. These data suggest that the high level of vaccine failure in Nicaragua is neither due to antigenic drift nor to the emergence of new antigenically-distinct virus strains. Our data also suggest that the widespread use of RotaTeq has led to the introduction of vaccine genes into circulating human RVs.\",\n",
       " 'In our earlier studies we have developed experimental models for the triggering of symptoms in both premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMD) and postpartum depression that we continue to employ in our efforts to identify both the underlying biology of these conditions as well as the development of new safe and effective therapies for women with these conditions.  We have extended and replicated our earlier findings by demonstrating that women with PMD (n = 35), who respond to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced ovarian suppression experience a recurrence of PMD after the initial re-exposure to combined estradiol and progesterone.  However, recurrent symptoms do not occur once hormone levels are stabilized over the subsequent two months of continuous replacement therapy.  These observations are of both clinical and scientific importance, as they identify promising phenotypes and suggest the physiologic basis for the susceptibility to experience PMD and will also provide alternative hormone-based therapies for women with this condition.    In addition to our studies on the behavioral effects of changes in ovarian steroids across the menstrual cycle and during the postpartum, we employ methodologies to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms of these conditions including studies investigating HPA axis responsivity and those employing positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  First, we hypothesized that women with PMDD would show abnormalities of HPA axis function analogous to those reported in depressive illness, and that ovarian steroids would differentially regulate HPA axis function in women with PMDD compared with asymptomatic controls. Eighteen women with PMDD and twenty-five controls underwent an open-label trial of the GnRH agonist depot Lupron with ovarian steroid replacement administered in a double-blind crossover design. HPA axis function was similar in PMDD compared with controls.  In all, progesterone significantly increased the secretion of cortisol and ACTH compared with estradiol and hypogonadism. Our data demonstrate that HPA axis regulation is normal in PMD, suggesting that the pathophysiology of PMD differs from major depression.  Second, our neuroimaging studies have identified both a neural substrate of risk in PMDD as well as a brain-region specific response that could underlie the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids in this condition. We performed O15 PET and fMRI studies in women who are participating in the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism study.  In this study, cognitive activation was achieved using the N-back test which allows us to vary the cognitive load and the effort required to perform the task.  We observed that women with PMD show abnormal prefrontal recruitment, specifically greater activation than controls throughout the DLPFC bilaterally.  These findings are robust and observable in both 015 PET and fMRI techniques.  In both imaging modalities, significantly increased DLPFC activations in PMDD compared with controls occurred in all three hormone conditions and, therefore, were independent of hormone condition. Moreover, DLPFC activations in PMDD correlated negatively with  measures of PMD functional impairment (i.e., global assessment of functional impairment GAF scores), age of onset of PMDD, and baseline (prior to Lupron) symptom severity measures - the greater the over-activation, the greater the disability, the earlier age of onset, and the more severe baseline symptomatology) Our findings suggest that these persistent effects, even in the clinically asymptomatic phase of the hormone-manipulation paradigm(i.e., Lupron alone), may represent an enduring, trait-like predisposition to this hormonally-triggered disorder.  By identifying the prefrontal cortex, specifically the DLPFC, as key in the pathophysiology of PMDD, these data provide insight into potential neural mechanisms contributing to this disorder.  Additionally, in studies of resting state activations, we observed a significant interaction between diagnosis and hormone condition in several affect-related regions, including subgenual cingulate, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Women with PMDD had greater resting rCBF during Lupron alone (i.e., the asymptomatic state in PMDD) in the aforementioned brain regions compared with both progesterone and estradiol replacement (when symptoms can recur in PMD); whereas controls showed the opposite pattern. These data demonstrate that in PMD, ovarian hormones differentially impact resting rCBF in regions typically involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorders.  These data provide a framework for understanding control of affective state and propensity for mood destabilization in this condition. Future findings in these studies may identify disturbances of a process that is critical to the clinical phenomenology of PMD, a functional disturbance of the normal modulatory effect of gonadal steroids, and a locus of the disturbance.We collaborate with Drs. Rima Kaddurah-Daouk at Duke University and Thomas Hankemeier at Leiden University to more comprehensively examine the profile of steroid and steroid metabolites with a metabolomics platform employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy.  Our strategy is to perform metabolomic studies in women with PMD who respond to Lupron with elimination of symptoms and who experience return of symptoms during progesterone or estradiol replacement.  Thus, we wish to specifically examine the effects of both estradiol and progesterone on the pattern of steroid metabolites in women with PMD and an asymptomatic comparison group.  Our metabolomic and neuroimaging studies will be complemented by a new series of functional genomic studies performed in collaboration with David Goldmans laboratory at NIAAA, in which we employ lymphoid and fibroblast cell-lines obtained from women with PMD and controls who participate in our Lupron studies.  We hypothesize that the capacity for phenotypic differences between women with and those without PMD will be preserved in their cellular function.  These experiments allow us to explore the nature of the differential behavioral response by examining protein expression and changes in cellular behaviors associated with the exposure to physiologic levels of either estradiol or progesterone across the two different behavioral phenotypes (women with PMD who experience a remission of PMDD during ovarian suppression and a recurrence of PMDD when ovarian steroids are added back, and controls who are asymptomatic during all three hormone conditions).  Preliminary results show that women with PMD express more estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (but not beta) compared with controls (consistent with our findings of differential ER alpha allele frequency in PMD compared with controls observed in a prior study). Additionally, RNA sequencing strategies investigate the response to steroid hormone exposure in immortalized lymphoid cells in these same groups of women. . We observed statistically significant, quantitative and widespread differences in the PMDD transcriptome compared to a carefully selected asymptomatic control group. Our analyses identified several molecular pathways that appear to be altered in women with PMDD; one of these pathways, the chromatin modifying ESC/E(z) complex, is of particular interest as a potential candidate since it is regulated by estradiol and leads to genomic regions of transcriptional repression. The mechanism by which these pathways converge and possibly alter CNS function sufficient to manifest in PMDD will be the focus of our future studies in induced neuronal and glial cells.',\n",

       " 'While it is clear that HIV-1 assembly occurs predominantly on the plasma membrane (PM), the itinerary that the Gag precursor follows to reach its destination remains ill defined. Likewise, the host cell machinery that promotes Gag trafficking to the PM is incompletely understood. We and others have demonstrated that the matrix (MA) domain of Gag regulates targeting to the site of virus assembly, and we discovered that the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 and the ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) serve important functions in directing Pr55Gag to the PM. We are actively engaged in studies to elucidate further the cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 Gag trafficking. This effort combines virology, biochemistry, cell biology, and imaging techniques and is also being extended to the nonprimate lentiviruses equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Proteins of particular interest in this area include the Arf proteins, SNAREs, F-BAR domain proteins, clathrin, and FLJ90680. In studies related to Gag trafficking, we are also investigating the host cell machinery required for Gag localization to, and virus transfer across, the virological synapse.The viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins are incorporated into virions during the assembly process. We have shown that point mutations in the MA domain of Gag block Env incorporation, and demonstrated that the long gp41 cytoplasmic tail plays a cell-type-dependent role in Env incorporation. Despite the evidence for a direct interaction between MA and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail, the molecular mechanism by which Env is incorporated and the basis for cell type dependence of cytoplasmic tail function remain to be defined. We will address thehypothesis that host cell factors are likely to play an important role in Env incorporation into virions. We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay for Gag-Env interaction that will be useful in evaluating this hypothesis.[Corresponds to Freed Project 1 in the October 2011 site visit report of the HIV Drug Resistance Program]',\n",
       " 'Despite increasingly stark evidence that infectious diseases have dramatic effects on marine ecosystems, research on disease ecology in marine systems has lagged behind that in terrestrial systems. There is a particular need for long-term case studies, with quantitatively accurate data and well-characterized biology, to enable research into how oceanographic processes affect pathogen spread and how disease impacts will be altered by climate change. This unique project will carry out an integrated field, clinical, laboratory and modeling research approach to establish a case study for the dynamics of Leptospira interrogans in California sea lions (CSL; Zalophus californianus).  Leptospirosis has caused recurrent seasonal outbreaks in CSL since at least 1984, resulting in major disease outbreaks every 3-4 years. The PIs will investigate the quantitative impact of leptospirosis on CSL population dynamics and the mechanism that has enabled L. interrogans to persist in the CSL population over the past three decades. The project will answer the following hypotheses: 1. Data from stranded CSL provide quantitative information on long-term dynamics of L. interrogans prevalence in the free-ranging population, 2. L. interrogans impacts CSL population dynamics by infecting more than 20% of the CSL population during disease outbreaks, and killing 1-2% of infected CSL. The project will use this data to develop a mathematical model that integrates immunological and stranding data, which will then allow for predictions of the fraction of the CSL population that is infected each year, 3. L. interrogans is persistent in the CSL population, and the mechanism of persistence involves a chronic asymptomatic carrier state and subsequent shedding of L. interrogans by individual CSL. A longstanding puzzle concerns how the pathogen persists in the 6-8 month interval between outbreaks. The PIs will conduct a pathology study to determine whether CSL can become chronic carriers of L. interrogans, and will also sample free-ranging CSL individuals when disease outbreaks are not occurring to search for asymptomatic shedders. This project will establish the L. interrogans/CSL system as a unique and powerful case study for infectious disease in marine mammals, enabling subsequent research into impacts of climate change and connections to the broader coastal ecosystem.The broader impacts of this study will involve training graduate, veterinary, and postdoctoral students in interdisciplinary science. Outreach and involvement of underrepresented groups will be facilitated by a partnership with a UCLA program to engage minority and life-challenged undergraduates by making videos about the research for classroom and online viewing. Findings will be communicated using visitor center tours and mobile K-12 programs reaching >130,000 people per year. Finally, the research will inform reservoir control for leptospirosis worldwide and the results will be shared with environmental and health researchers and policymakers via the PIs leadership positions in the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission and other professional associations.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The central goal of this K24 renewal application is to further my development as a clinical investigator, while enhancing my opportunities and skills in the mentorship of fellows and promising young faculty interested in careers in clinical research. Patient-oriented clinical research has been the cornerstone of my medical career. My main research focus has been the investigation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). In recent years, my research has concentrated on the non-classical manifestations of PHPT, and the studies in this thematically related K24 program are focused in this area. My research goal is to continue to develop this program. All three themes of this renewal application were highlighted by the 3rd International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94:335-9, 2009) as key areas for future investigation. The themes and Specific Aims (SA's) of this research are: Theme 1. Vitamin D deficiency in PHPT: SA1a. To compare biochemical and skeletal features of PHPT patients with and without co-existing vitamin D deficiency. SA1b. To investigate the early effects of vitamin D repletion in PHPT on static and dynamic histomorphometric parameters of bone remodeling (by quadruple labeled bone biopsy). Theme 2. Cardiovascular manifestations of PHPT: SA2a. To determine whether or not abnormalities in cardiovascular structure or function in patients with asymptomatic PHPT are reversible after parathyroidectomy. SA2b. To investigate the hypothesis that some of the cardiovascular manifestations of PHPT are due to low vitamin D levels, rather than elevated calcium and PTH levels, by comparing left ventricular mass index and carotid intima medial thickness in PHPT patients with and without vitamin D deficiency. Theme 3. Neurocognitive manifestations of PHPT SA3a. To further investigate neurocognitive abnormalities in PHPT by assessing site-specific changes in brain metabolism after parathyroidectomy using the innovative technique of functional MRI. SA3b. To determine whether the neuropsychological abnormalities seen in hypercalcemic PHPT are present in normocalcemic PHPT. Although outside of the closely-knit theme of the K24, there are other ongoing and future opportunities for mentored research (i.e. theme: obesity/bariatric surgery and the skeleton: 3 mentored studies ongoing). Importantly, the proposal will provide many opportunities to mentor junior investigators. I have had success as a mentor, with 16 current or past trainees, 10 of whom have been mentored under the current K24 award. Seven of the 10 remain in academic medicine. Of those I have mentored, 3 currently hold and 1 recently completed NIH K23 Awards, 3 completed Masters in POR (2 under my mentorship) and 2 received Endocrine Fellows Foundations grants. One mentee, who has worked with me since her fellowship began, was awarded a NIH stimulus grant. As Co-Director of our NIH Postdoctoral Fellowship Program and Director of the 4th yr Endocrinology Elective in the medical school, I have ongoing access to medical students, residents, Endocrine Fellows and junior faculty who are interested in my research. There has also been interest in my research from trainees in other disciplines (current cardiology fellow Iwata), enhancing my potential to add interdisciplinary perspectives to POR in metabolic bone diseases that should enhance our field. My mentorship goals for this K24 are both to have the opportunity to mentor, and to further develop my mentorship skills. New directions for mentorship will include: 1. I will develop a new program to educate mentors in the Department of Medicine; creating a curriculum for developing mentoring skills and convening mentors to share and refine best practices. 2. I will expand my mentoring in new directions: a) outside of my research area as a Mentor in the Department of Medicine Faculty Development Program; and b) within my research area but outside of Columbia in online mentorship programs (ASBMR Mentor Matching program and The Endocrine Society's Mentor Exchange). I will develop new mentorship skills, learning to transmit critical information electronically ratherthan in person and by example. 3. Coursework at Columbia on: mentoring, FDA regulated research and research with minors will sharpen and expand my tools for mentoring. The environment at Columbia is outstanding, with a large and supportive Endocrine Division, an excellent NIH funded Clinical Research Center and CTSA, which offers my mentees the opportunity for didactic enrichment in POR through their Master of Science in POR program (Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and CTSA). Both the Department of Medicine and the GCRC have made substantial commitments toward my development as a clinical investigator. The initial K24 funding period allowed me to reduce my clinical, administrative and teaching loads in order to devote more time to clinical research and to training and mentoring junior faculty and fellows. This award remains an ideal mechanism to allow me to achieve my dual goals: continued productivity in the clinical investigation of parathyroid disease, with protected time for mentoring fellows and junior colleagues interested in patient oriented clinical research as a career path.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demonstration of an apparent cure for HIV after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation of a leukemia patient in Berlin offers an important proof-of-principle for AIDS gene therapy. However, inefficient transfer of anti-HIV genes has limited success in AIDS gene therapy clinical trials. We previously developed foamy virus (FV) anti-HIV vectors that potently inhibit HIV replication and efficiently transduce human repopulating cells in a mouse xenotransplant model. Here we will develop improved combinatorial FV vectors designed to inhibit HIV escape and to be safer in preparation for using FV vectors in the clinic. Our proposal directly address two critical challenges for AIDS gene therapy, 1) to develop combinations of transgenes that potently inhibit HIV replication and escape, and 2) to improve the safety of HSC gene therapy and better understand safety in terms of potential clonal expansion and activation of proto-oncogenes. FV vectors offer several advantages for AIDS gene therapy including a distinct and potentially safer integration profile and the ability to efficiently deliver anti-HIV transgenes that interfere with HIV-based lentiviralvector titers. We will develop improved, safer FV anti-HIV vectors and directly compare their safety to lentiviral vectors which are currently being used in clinical trials. We will also explor ways to make FV vectors safer by modifying the integration profile to direct integration away from genes including proto-oncogenes. We will evaluate safety in vivo in human repopulating cells using an established xenograft model we have extensive experience with. Our proposal takes advantage of several unique properties of FV vectors and builds upon our published data showing FV vectors effectively deliver anti-HIV transgenes that interfere with HIV-based lentiviral vectors.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health crisis of malaria-HIV co-infection is rapidly expanding in sub-Saharan Africa. Lowland western Kenya in particular is holoendemic for malaria transmission and is plagued with catastrophically high rates of HIV/AIDS infection. A 2006 mathematical model of transmission in this region retrospectively predicted that co-infection has resulted in a cumulative excess of 8,500 HIV-1 infections and 980,000 malaria episodes since 1980. Individuals infected with HIV experience more frequent and more severe episodes of clinical malaria and the risk increases with advancing HIV disease. However, our pilot studies and a significant body of published data also suggest that specific increases in asymptomatic parasitemias and gametocytemias also are likely to occur in HIV-infected individuals in malaria-holoendemic areas. While numerous studies have examined one or more of the complicating aspects of co-infection and symptomatic malaria in cross-sectional studies, no studies have attempted to determine the longitudinal epidemiological impact of co-infection on asymptomatic malaria and specifically on malaria transmission in regions characterized by high transmission of both diseases and by increasing antimalarial drug resistance. Antifolates are widely prescribed for prophylaxis of HIV-associated opportunistic infections, yet they are also known to increase the appearance of gametocytes. We hypothesize that co-infection with HIV, and associated therapy, could be directly responsible for significant increases in asymptomatic parasite carriage and gametocytemia as well as increased antifolate- resistant parasite genotypes and, therefore, contribute directly to the increased burden of falciparum malaria. To this end, we propose to focus complementary clinical and entomological studies using highly sensitive and specific molecular tools in a highly endemic area of western Kenya to assess point and longitudinal prevalence's of co-infection in general and gametocytemia in particular with an emphasis on longitudinal risk of malaria transmission in the context of prevailing HIV therapies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is associated with serious cardiovascular complications that include atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and myocardial dysfunction even in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease, a disorder termed diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Data from studies of animal models and human subjects provide evidence that alterations in myocardial lipid metabolism is central to the pathogenesis of DCM, which early on can be asymptomatic, but which can progress to symptomatic heart failure. The ability to identify new disease markers to facilitate early detection and intervention is limited b inadequacies of existing measures of systemic and myocardial lipid metabolism in humans. In our Preliminary Studies, we have addressed this problem by using sensitive mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify two plasma very long-chain ceramides, Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0), that are highly correlated with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction in obese and type 2 diabetic humans. Cell biological and mouse model studies suggest these species arise from the unique intersection of ectopic lipid accumulation and activation of innate immune signaling pathways. We hypothesize that plasma Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0) reflect systemic alterations in lipid metabolism that can be exploited as novel biomarkers for DCM. While the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction can be readily made noninvasively by echocardiogram, Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0) track with pathophysiological consequences of ectopic lipid accumulation and thus have potential to predict individuals at risk, to further our understanding of disease mechanism, and to identify new treatment targets. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team to extend these findings by 1) Developing a robust high-throughput clinical assay for Cer(22:0) and Cer(24:0); 2) Validating and extending these findings in two existing cohorts of human subjects; 3) Exploring the mechanistic links between very long-chain ceramides and cardiac dysfunction in relevant mouse models of DCM; and 4) Defining the direction of causality in the relationships among lipid exposure, plasma ceramides, and cardiac function in humans with type 2 diabetes. Our approach has the potential to define an integrated measure of pathophysiologically relevant lipid exposure that can be used to track intervention success, data linking phenotype to a modifiable risk factor that is currently undertreated in the target population (dyslipidemia), and  marker for future disease risk that can be acted upon to prevent clinically apparent morbidity and mortality.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Otitis media is one of the most common diseases seen in pediatric practice and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S. The long-term objectives of our research team are to elucidate the contribution of infectious pathogens, and their complex interactions with other otitis risk factors in the pathogenesis of and recovery from acute otitis media (AOM), and to identify possible strategies for more effective prevention and/or treatment. Respiratory viruses play an important role in AOM pathogenesis; AOM often occurs as a consequence of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). One way to prevent AOM is to prevent URI or stop its progress to AOM; these require knowledge and understanding of the process of AOM development after URI and on bacteria and viruses involved. Recent use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect viruses has generated new questions on asymptomatic infection, viral persistence, and multiple viral infections during URI and its AOM complication. In this revision proposal, we will use a recently developed, cost-effective, high throughput, PCR-based system to identify and quantify a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses and sequence the viruses, to study early life viral infections, virl persistence and viral - bacterial interactions in AOM pathogenesis. Aim 1: Determine the causative viruses and the incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic viral URI in infants during the first 6 months of life and the effect of viral load and co-presence of pathogenic bacteria on URI symptoms and AOM development. Aim 2: Characterize rhinovirus and RSV that are detected repeatedly in sequential samples, to differentiate new infection from prolonged presence of virus nucleic acids in the respiratory tract using a cost-effective sequence-based screening paradigm. The parent grant supports an ongoing study of 300 infants with or without a known genetic risk, enrolled from near birth and followed to the first AOM episode or between 6-12 mos. of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens are collected monthly (mos. 1-6) to study the acquisition of bacterial pathogens and during symptomatic URI episodes and AOM. We will utilize these existing specimens for detection and quantification of 13 most common respiratory viruses. We will sequence the viruses that are detected repeatedly to differentiate new infection from prolonged presence. This study will determine the novel incidence of asymptomatic URI in young infants and define the role of asymptomatic URI in AOM pathogenesis. Quantitative PCR data will address the relationship between viral load and symptom severity and help indicate the likely pathogen in case of multiple virus detection; results will also provide an immediate benefiton PCR result interpretation during respiratory infections in clinical setting. Information generated from the study will be important to public health as it will have clinical implication an will lay the ground work for future design and development of novel strategies such as specific viral vaccines, use of antivirals or antibiotics to prevent URI and/or AOM to reduce the public health burden of these highly prevalent diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diverticular disease is one of the most prevalent disorders in western societies, and complications of diverticulosis are frequent, costly and often recurrent. Identification of individuals at high risk for these complications is of great clinical importance. However, few risk factors have been identified, and no preventative strategies exist short of segmental colectomy. The role of human intestinal microbiota in disease is increasingly being recognized. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology now enable cost-effective, large-scale profiling of the intestinal microbiota, and provide a new quantitative tool for the study of gastrointestinal disorders. The intestinal microbiota represent an attractive target for study in diverticular disease since they can be sampled, providing the basis for a potential biomarkers and preventative interventions. The overall goal of this proposal is to profile the intestinal microbiota in both patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis and those with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. We plan to use a combination of state-of-the-art molecular and novel metagenomic approaches, and to determine whether quantitative analysis of the intestinal microbiome can be used to differentiate diverticular disease phenotypes. Uncovering such differences would be of great potential clinical significance, since they could be modeled to (i) enable outcome prediction and risk stratification; (ii) provide avenues for treatment and prevention, and (iii) reveal insight into pathogenesis. In pursuit of this goal, we plan to profile the intestinal microbiome in diverticular disease using two parallel study cohorts: (i) 100 patients with asymptomatic diverticulosis recruited prospectively from the outpatient endoscopy units of two large teaching hospitals; and (ii) 100 prospectively identified patients with diverticulosis complicated by acute diverticulitis. Replicate fecal DNA samples will be collected longitudinally from each study individual using well-tested methods. We will then perform intestinal microbiome profiling using a combination of metagenomic Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism (tRFLP) analysis and a novel digital 16S fingerprinting approach utilizing next-generation sequencing. These data will yield deep, high-resolution fingerprints of the intestinal microbial metagenome in each disease population, which can then be compared to identify composite biomarkers that predict disease complications.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is superior to medical therapy in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, while the majority of patients who undergo carotid revascularization receive treatment for asymptomatic disease, the benefit of revascularization for patients with asymptomatic disease is quite modest. In addition, the clinical trials were initiated about 20 years ago, and in the intervening period, medical therapy has greatly improved for this vascular disease due to new pharmacological advances such as high potency statins, improved antiplatelet regimens, and better control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. In parallel, as the surgical complication rate for CEA has decreased, the use of carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been gaining favor in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. While recent trials have focused exclusively on comparing CEA to CAS, the declining stroke rate associated with medically managed carotid stenosis has led many to question whether either revascularization procedure is superior to aggressive vascular risk factor control. A three-arm RCT could answer this question, but such a study would be very expensive, not provide answers for a long time, and might only enroll the subset of healthiest patients typically studied in an RCT. Since the first RCT was published that demonstrated the superiority of CEA compared to medical therapy there has been a concern that the modest benefit observed in the trials may not be reproducible in the community. To address the ongoing debate of whether among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, CEA is still superior to medical therapy and whether CAS is superior to medical therapy (which has never been evaluated in an RCT), we propose to examine the comparative effectiveness of initial medical therapy compared to early carotid intervention in a retrospective cohort study of 6000 patients using merged Veteran's Health Administration and Medicare data. We will specifically compare each revascularization strategy to medical therapy and also examine the impact of a number of key variables (e.g. age, presence of atrial fibrillation) on the comparative effectiveness of intervention compared to medical therapy. We will use advanced statistical techniques to overcome observed and unobserved differences in the medical therapy and intervention cohorts. We will compare the 30-day and 5 year outcomes of 3175 patients managed medically, 1500 patients who received CEA, and 1325 patients who received CAS entering the cohort from 2005 to 2008. Our overarching hypothesis is that medical therapy has improved to a degree that only certain subgroups of patients may benefit from revascularization and that for many patients medical therapy may be the preferred treatment strategy.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcal meningitis is a devastating disease in AIDS patients, with a mortality of 12% in the U.S. and 20-90% in resource-limited settings. Cryptococcosis can exist as a latent infection with an average cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) positivity of 21 days prior to development of symptoms, although some studies suggest evidence of latency for years. Recent research found an 8-18% prevalence of CrAg+ in asymptomatic AIDS patients in Africa and Asia with CD4-/<100 cells/mm3. CrAg+ predicted development of symptomatic cryptococcal disease and subsequent mortality, while fluconazole use was associated with increased survival. Asymptomatic CrAg+ has not been characterized in HIV-infected patients in the United States. This study seeks to determine the prevalence and natural history of asymptomatic CrAg+ in the United States. For further investigation of latent cryptococcal disease and immune-mediated risks of reactivation, development of a murine model of latent cryptococcal disease is proposed.    Aims: 1) To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic CrAg among AIDS patients with CD4< 200 cells/mm3 in the United States, and to characterize the risk factors associated with the development of symptomatic cryptococcal disease. 2) To develop a murine model of latent cryptococcal infection, and use CrAg titers to monitor disease activity and quantify disease burden with immunosuppression and subsequent restoration of immune function.    Research Design: In Aim 1, stored plasma samples of asymptomatic HIV patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 enrolled in U.S.-based ACTG studies will be screened for CrAg to determine prevalence. To assess risk factors for developing disease, subjects positive for baseline CrAg who did, and did not develop cryptococcal disease will be compared with respect with serial CrAg titers, CD4, VL, timing of antiretroviral therapy, and fluconazole use. In Aim 2, a murine model of latent cryptococcal infection will be developed by inhalationally infecting mice with C. neoformans to establish persistent, low level infection. Latently infected mice will be immunosuppressed with anti-CD4 antibody, with one group of mice subjected to persistent CD4-depletion, while the other group will have immunosuppression lifted. Both groups will be followed for reactivation, persistence or spontaneous resolution of disease. Serial quantitative CrAg lateral flow assays (LFAs) will be followed in whole blood, serum and urine, and correlated with fungal burden in mouse organs.    Implications: This study will provide the first description of asymptomatic cryptococcal disease inthe United States, and is a necessary step towards developing appropriate treatment guidelines for CrAg+ HIV/AIDS patients in the United States. Development of a murine model that allows for manipulation of immune status will contribute to a greater understanding of the disease in AIDS patients, and provide a valuable tool for further study of pathogenesis and disease management.',\n",
       " \"Malaria continues to cause marked morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infection can result in severe life threatening disease, mild symptoms or an asymptomatic carriage state. Protection from severe disease outcomes naturally occurs in residents high Plasmodium falciparum transmission regions This protection is related to repeated malaria exposures which result in mild to asymptomatic carriage rather than devastating complications which occurs in non-immune individuals. The basis of this clinical observation made decades ago remains poorly characterized. Our group and others have identified a role for type IINF response during malarial infection. Type I INF is known as a powerful immunomodulatory molecule that can promote activation, differentiation or even apoptosis of effector cells such as NK and T lymphocytes ahd favor cross-priming by DCs. Thus our working hypothesis proposes that a stronger type I IFN response in malaria infections is associated with a more protective host innate and adaptive immune responses. We will examine the role of type I INF during mild malaria and whether this response changes during repeated infections in one individual, alters the risk of re-infection and is associated with transmission intensity. This proposal brings Dr. Lauvau's expertise in studying immune responses against microbial pathogens, Dr. Daily's expertise in transcriptional analysis with the Malawi ICEMR program to characterize innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses in children with mild disease in a longitudinal study. This proposal will enhance the Malawi ICEMR goals of understanding the determinants of malarial disease. Host immune responses alter the development of malarial disease and thus this proposal will provide a further characterization of host responses to inform disease models. We will also address how changes in transmission intensity through malaria control interventions in the parent study may alter host response and disease presentation. Finally this proposal will further the training mission of the Malawi ICEMR by training Malawian scientists and building in-country laboratory and scientific capacity in malaria immunology.\",\n",
       " 'AbstractNumerous clinically used agents contain the ester chemotype, a moiety frequently added to smallmolecules to improve their water solubility and bioavailability. However the inclusion of this function inthese compounds makes them substrates for carboxylesterases (CEs), enzymes that can eitherinactivate or activate these agents. Typically examples include the anticancer agent CPT-11 (irinotecan,Camptosar) that is a prodrug of SN-38, a potent topoisomerase I poison, and the antiviral drugoseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) that requires hydrolysis to the carboxylate form to yield the activeneuraminidase inhibitor. Hence, compounds that might inhibit the hydrolysis reactions would limit theefficacy of these drugs. We have identified a class of compounds (tanshinones) that are present withinthe Chinese herbal medicine Danshen. Extracts from this material can potently inhibit human CEs andmodulate drug activity in vitro. Importantly however, the FDA has just approved the use of Danshen inclinical trials. Hence any esterified drug that is administered in conjunction with the herbal medicine mightlead to reduced molecule hydrolysis, thereby mitigating the efficacy of the agent. We seek therefore, toevaluate the active component(s) in Danshen and to assess whether these molecules can modulate drugactivity in defined animal models.The specific aims of this application are: 1) To determine the inhibitory compounds present withinDanshen; 2) to assess the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by these compounds; 3) to assess thebiological activity of these extracts in vitro; and 4) to determine the effect of such compounds/extracts ondrug efficacy in animals models.We anticipate that compounds present within Danshen will inhibit the CEs in vivo, resulting insignificantly reduced drug hydrolysis, and as a consequence, reduced drug efficacy. Since this materialis currently in clinical trials, the information derived from these studies may identify novel drug:druginteractions that potentially would impact the effectiveness of clinically used esterified compounds. Weenvisage that the studies proposed here will validate this hypothesis and provide information concerningthe use of such extracts in defined patient populations.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is a major cause of vision loss worldwide. The long term goal of this competitive renewal application is to develop an effective vaccine that will produce protective immunity against ocular herpes. Natural HSV-1 immunity does not efficiently protect against recurrent infections or new infections, suggesting that an effective vaccine will have to induce different and/or more vigorous immune responses than the sub-optimal natural immunity. The research in this application will specifically focus on:(1) Identifying human HSV-1 epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from individuals with high (symptomatic) and no (asymptomatic) recurrent herpes disease. (2) Using asymptomatic epitopes only to design a powerful  protective  T cell based herpes vaccine. During the initial funding cycle (2003-2009) and one year of ARRA funding (2009-2010), we have discovered that some HSV-1 gB and gD epitopes were strongly recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from asymptomatic patients but not from symptomatic patients, while other gB and gD epitopes were strongly recognized by T-cells from symptomatic but not from asymptomatic patients (P<0.005). Lack of strong response is not due to clonal deletion of an epitope specific TCR, since the response is not missing, it is just much lower. We obtained proof-of-principle that intranasal immunization of double transgenic mice expressing both class 1 and class 2 Human Leukocyte Antigens (i.e. HLA-DR and HLA-A2.1) with  asymptomatic  CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes linked to a lipid moiety (lipopeptides), but not with  symptomatic  CD4+ and CD8+ peptide epitopes, induced strong local HSV-specific T cells and provided protection against ocular challenge with HSV-1. Besides, gB and gD, HSV-1 tegument proteins VP11/12 and VP13/14 are also major targets for effector T cells. These intriguing results, together with relate reports by others in the field, lead us to hypothesize that: (1) Some HSV-1 epitopes are recognized differently by T cells from symptomatic compared to asymptomatic individuals. (2) Some epitopes recognized only by T cells from symptomatic individuals are pathogenic ( symptomatic epitopes ); whereas some epitopes recognized only by T cells from asymptomatic individuals are protective ( asymptomatic epitopes ). Our Specific Aims include: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that, although most HSV-1 epitopes are recognized by both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, there are human CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes from gB, gD, VP11/12 and VP13/14 that are strongly recognized only by asymptomatic patients or only by symptomatic patients; Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that immunization with a combination of multiple  asymptomatic  epitopes from gB, gD, VP11/12 and VP13/14, will increase the magnitude, breadth and duration of T-cell protective immunity. A vaccine that incorporates only asymptomatic HSV-1 human T-cell epitopes and excludes symptomatic epitopes is a novel approach that should break new ground in our understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying ocular herpes disease and may ultimately lead to an effective vaccine.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery results in neurological problems. Inflammatory cytokines in the plaque induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thus thinning the fibrous cap and resulting in plaque destabilization and rupture. During the initial funding cycle, we made novel observations that IGF-1 is more potent in inducing the survival of VSMCs in carotid endarterectomy tissues of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. Also, atheroma-associated cytokines decrease IGF-1-induced survival and proliferation of VSMCs. In our follow-up studies we observed specific differences in the profile of dendritic cells (DCs), T-regulatory cells, and NPY and NPY receptors in symptomatic (unstable) and asymptomatic (stable) plaques. Also, stronger immunoreactivity of Foxp3, IL-10 and CD25 with preponderance of CD4? T cells in carotid plaques of asymptomatic than symptomatic patients. IGF-1 increased mRNA transcripts of NPY-Y2 and NPY-Y5 receptors in asymptomatic but not in symptomatic plaque SMCs. These novel findings suggest a cell-mediated immune response in carotid plaques which is regulated by NPY. Our central hypothesis is that the inflammation in the carotid plaque is modulated by interaction of NPY with DCs and T cells leading to increased inflammation and apoptosis of VSMCs in carotid plaques of symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis, and that atheroma-associated cytokines modulate NPY receptors and their function in VSMCs of carotid plaques. In Aim 1, we will examine the phenotypes of dendritic cells and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules in DCs in the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. In Aim 2, we will examine the phenotype of T-regulatory cells (inducible CD4? T-regs and naturally-occurring CD4???? T-regs) and the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of IGF-1, on the cell surface expression of the receptors for co-stimulatory molecules (PD-1, CTLA- 4) in T-regs from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. We will also determine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of atheroma-associated cytokines, on the differentiation of naive T cells into T-regulatory cells. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of NPY, in the presence and absence of inflammatory cytokines, on the survival and apoptosis of VSMCs isolated from the carotid plaques of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the instability and rupture of carotid plaques in patients with carotid stenosis. Such investigations would provide unique insights to the pathophysiologic process of neurological diseases associated with the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and the means to prevent the disease in patients with carotid stenosis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many patients with blockade of their neck artery develop neurological symptoms including transient ischemic attack or stroke. This is primarily due to breaking off the atherosclerotic plaque in the neck artery. In this project experiments are proposed to examine the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the plaque rupture. Information obtained from this study should provide an opportunity to formulate superior therapeutic approaches in the prevention of stroke.',\n",

These new translational research skills will enable me to achieve the career goal of making the transition to an independent investigator. Environment: I have assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentor (Dr. Philip De Jager, an expert in incorporating human genomics techniques into the study of complex neurologic disorders) and co-mentors (Dr. Issac Kohane, an expert in bioinformatics and predictive modeling; Dr. Daniel Reich, an expert in MS neuroimaging), consultants and senior faculty members with complementary expertise who will guide my research and promote my career development. This multi-layered mentor structure is embedded in a highly collaborative environment of unparalleled intellectual caliber that is part of Harvard-affiliated institutions: BWH Department o Neurology, BWH Institute of Neurosciences, Broad Institute, and HMS. Dr. Martin Samuels (Chairman of BWH Department of Neurology) and Dr. David Silbersweig (Chairman of BWH Institute of Neurosciences) are both supportive of my career plan. Research: An important challenge facing clinical care in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the lack of robust predictive tools toguide individualized risk stratification for subjects at risk of developing MS. The overall goal ofthe study is to test the efficacy of an algorithm that integrates existing genetic and environmental data into a single, individual estimate of the risk of developing MS. We hypothesize that such an algorithm can provide MS risk stratification for asymptomatic subjects at risk of MS, such as family members or patients with Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS: asymptomatic individuals with incidental findings of MS-like lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). First, we will calculate our MS genetic and environmental risk score (GERSMS) in a cohort of 500 neurologically asymptomatic first-degree relatives of MS patients and assess whether the 100 subjects with the highest GERSMS exhibit an MS-associated peripheral blood biomarker profile when compared to the 100 subjects with the lowest GERSMS. Second, we will assess the efficacy of GERSMS in predicting the presence of MRI-defined MS lesions and other MS-related MRI outcomes in neurologically asymptomatic first- degree relatives and assess whether the 50 subjects with the highest GERSMS have more MS-like lesions, smaller brain volume or greater diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes that suggest loss of white matter tract integrity when compared to the 50 subjects with the lowest GERSMS. Finally, we will assess the efficacy of GERSMS in predicting conversion to clinical MS in RIS patients identified from existing EMR-derived data. Innovation: This proposal is innovative since it applies a novel approach to address an understudied question: how do we identify asymptomatic individuals who are at the highest risk of developing multiple sclerosis? The proposed study leverages a recently published, robust analytic method that is further enhanced by the most up-to-date genetic information and validated epidemiological data to produce a novel single estimate of risk for MS. We will test the method in two unique sample collections of asymptomatic subjects: (a) asymptomatic first-degree relatives of MS patients, (b) RIS patients identified from one of the largest EMR systems Specifically, we will assess the efficacy of this method in the selection of cutting-edge blood biomarkers and sensitive neuroimaging measures. If validated, our approach has the potential to make the study of asymptomatic subjects feasible by identifying the subset of subjects at the highest risk of transitioning from health to MS, thus opening up a whole new area of investigation in MS that could ultimately shed light on the design of strategies to prevent the onset of MS. Finally, the utilization of an EMR-derived virtualcohort for translational genetics research opens a rich resource for tackling challenging translational research questions that cannot be easily addressed by traditional cohort studies: (1) unforeseen co-morbidities of neurological disorders, (2) unrecognized neurological complications of medications on the market, particularly new immune modulating biologic agents. These future studies are not restricted to the field of MS and create future areas to develop independent investigation.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Redox sensitive transcription factors are pivotal in maintaining the normal oxidative milieu of cells. While an imbalance in redox status is implicated in hypertension, the link between this phenomenon and hypertension is not clear. In addition, it has been shown that many bioactive compounds, extranutritional constituents (nutraceuticals) that typically occur in small quantities in foods, have antioxidant properties and lower blood pressure, the exact mechanism for these beneficial effects is unclear. We, and others, have reported that renal dopamine via activation of D1 receptor (D1R) plays a major role in regulation of sodium homeostasis and blood pressure (BP). Renal D1R function is down-regulated in chronic diseases, especially in oxidative stress related hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the identification of cellular molecules which contributes to D1R dysfunction as well as the mechanism by which dietary compounds can preserve renal D1R function will provide a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate hypertension.  Transcription factors such as AP1 and SP3 play an important role in oxidative stress related pathophysiological conditions. Conversely, redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 activates a highly regulated defense system against oxidative stress which involves transcriptional activation of phase II defense and antioxidant genes. Our preliminary studies showed that mice treated with L-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), a glutathione synthesis pathway inhibitor exhibited oxidative stress, high BP, renal proximal tubular D1R dysfunction and up-regulation of AP1 and SP3. These phenomena were exaggerated in BSO-treated renal proximal tubule specific Nrf2 knockout mice. More importantly, sulforaphane (a polyphenol antioxidant) activated Nrf2, reduced oxidative stress, normalized AP1 and SP3 activation, preserved DIR function and lowered BP in BSO-treated wild type mice but failed to normalize renal D1R function or reduce BP in Nrf2 knockout mice. Further experiments in human kidney cells (a proximal tubular epithelial cell line) also indicated that: 1) BSO via AP1 activated SP3 which in turn transcriptionally down-regulated D1R expression and 2) sulforaphane, via Nrf2 activation, abolished BSO-induced AP1 and SP3 activation and D1R dysfunction. These findings led us to hypothesize that: 1) oxidative stress via AP1-SP3 pathway down-regulates D1R expression and function which leads to decrease in sodium excretion and hypertension and 2) antioxidants via Nrf2 activation reduce oxidative stress and normalize AP1-SP3 signaling and D1R function which reduces BP. Therefore, it is likely that polyphenols, such as sulforaphane and resveratrol, via activation of Nrf2 signaling would provide a novel mechanism to protect D1R function and mitigate hypertension during oxidative stress. These studies will have significant impact on understanding the mechanisms for potential public health benefits of antioxidants as recent studies in humans have shown that polyphenols and direct Nrf2 activators can reduce BP and improve kidney function in CKD and type 2 diabetic patients.',\n",
       " 'Project 6: Mothes/Blanchard Conformational trajectories of inhibitor-bound HIV-1 envelope Summary The design of effective antiviral therapies directed against HIV Env pursued by this program requires a fast method to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV Env inhibition by small molecule inhibitors. Towards this end, we have established single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) methods to visualize directly the structural dynamics of HIV Env in the context of the complete trimer on the surface of HIV virions. As a proof of concept we have successfully applied smFRET to the X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3- Our work reveals that the unliganded HIV Env is conformationally dynamic and intrinsically capable of sampling receptor CD4- and 17b-stabilized conformations. Importantly, the co-receptor binding site is more likely to be accessed from the CD4-induced state. Binding of CD4 lowers the energy of the CD4-stabilized conformation and prepares the HIV Env for co-receptor binding. These data explain how HIV Env is activated in a stepwise manner by CD4 and the co-receptor. Here, we will extend the application of smFRET to include physiologically relevant R5-tropic HIV-1 Env isolates. Dually modified HIV-1 Env variants will be used to determine the conformational trajectories of HIV Env induced by CD4 mimetics and antagonists. This will allow distinction between CD4 mimics such as NBD556 that induce CD4-like conformational changes and antagonists such as DMJ-l-228. smFRET imaging will also permit an understanding of conformational molecular events underlying HlV-1 inactivation either by prematurely activating Env, kinetic traps or allosterically diverting Env into off-pathways. As such, these smFRET technologies will provide a critical tool to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV Env antagonism and inactivation developed by the Program Project Team and aid in a rational design of antiviral therapies that exploit the intrinsic vulnerabilities of HIV. smFRET technologies will accelerate pharmaceutical discovery by enabling screening for desired conformational effects that block, trap or inactivate HIV-1 Env.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Diverticulosis is a common and expensive condition in the United States. In 2004 there were 815,000 hospitalizations for diverticular disease, 3.3 million ambulatory care visits, and 2.4 million prescriptions written. With an aging population allthese figures will increase. Despite the considerable economic and medical burden from diverticular disease, information on the etiology is largely nonexistent because asymptomatic diverticulosis has never been adequately studied. The proposed study builds upon a cross sectional study in which, contrary to expectation, the investigators found that a high-fiber diet was associated with increased (rather than a decreased) prevalence odds of diverticulosis with a significant dose response and a stronger effect among individuals with more frequent diverticula. The study will test the hypothesis that gut microbes are responsible for an altered immune response and a state of chronic inflammation that could lead to the development of diverticulosis possibly through alterations in the integrity of the colonic wall or altered motilit. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the prevalence and demographic characteristics of asymptomatic diverticulosis among a group of individuals undergoing first time screening colonoscopy. (2) To determine dietary and lifestyle risk factors for diverticulosis. (3) To evaluat the association between the adherent microbial flora and diverticulosis. (4) To assess local inflammation and immune activation in the colonic mucosa to support an inflammatory etiology for diverticulosis. To conduct the study, detailed dietary and lifestyle information will be colleced on 900 study subjects who undergo complete screening colonoscopy with careful investigation for diverticulosis. Sigmoid colon biopsies will be used to evaluate adherent bacterial organisms using pyrosequencing. Local inflammation and immune activation in tissue will be measured by immunohistochemistry. Blood will be stored for future studies of genes that might predispose to diverticular disease. The study is designed to correct the shortcomings of prior research on asymptomatic diverticulosis and test biological hypotheses about etiology. The proposed study is a first step in understanding the cause of diverticulosis with the hope of preventing the disease and its complications',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is a revision of grant number R01-ES01219, entitled  Factors modifying the Neurotoxicity of Methylmercury . The revision will expand the parent grant to create a Virtual Consortium for Translational/Transdisciplinary Environmental Research (ViCTER). The aim of the original grant is to extend the Seychelles Child Development and Nutrition Study (SCDNS) to study in more depth the investigators' novel finding of an apparent modulation of MeHg neurotoxicity by maternal long- chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status. The investigators hypothesize that the apparent effect modification seen in their earlier study may have been due to anti- oxidants (selenium and vitamin E) in the maternal diet, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 PUFA from fish consumption. Glutathione (GSH) is essential for excretion of MeHg and there is recent evidence that variants of genes associated with GSH metabolism are determinants of MeHg retention in the body. This genetic association has yet to be determined in a well-characterized high fish eating population. Furthermore, genes responsible for PUFA metabolism have been shown to influence the systemic PUFA status. These genetic variations may influence MeHg and PUFA dose that in turn strongly offset MeHg neurotoxicity and similarly influence the protective anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 PUFA. Understanding these genes' influence on MeHg, PUFA and antioxidant metabolism would clarify, for the first time, whether population differences in the ris-benefit ratio for fish intake can be accounted for by genetic variation.  The proposed project willcreate a Virtual Consortium with the theme: Genetic Modifiers of Mercury Toxicity and Nutrient Metabolism. The consortium will include two new partners. Dr. Karin Broberg, a genetic epidemiologist at the University of Lund, has studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to metal toxicokinetics in human populations for several years and will analyze DNA samples from the SCDNS cohort mothers. Once maternal blood samples have been characterized for MeHg and PUFA related SNPs, statistical analyses will be used to investigate how genetic variation may modify individual MeHg exposure and PUFA status and, in turn, explain how the SNPs modify MeHg toxicity (toxicodynamics) in the parent study. Dr. Matthew Rand, a developmental neurobiologist at the University of Vermont, has used a Drosophila platform to identify genes associated with tolerance to MeHg during development. Both new investigations add novel and innovative mechanistic studies to characterize human genetic variations that impact on the kinetics and toxicity of MeHg as well as beneficial effects of PUFA and dietary antioxidants. Their previous collaborations have demonstrated innovative transdisciplinary and translational synergies such that genes identified by Dr. Broberg can be tested in Dr. Rand's laboratory while genes and genetic variations in those genes linked to MeHg tolerance in Drosophila by Dr. Rand can help focus Dr. Broberg's work on SNPs that appear particularly important to the neurotoxicity of MeHg.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Anti-angiogenic therapy (AAT) targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis is an important component of treatment for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Many novel therapeutic strategies are being developed in combination with AAT in the next generation of clinical trials for GBM. Unfortunately, these combinations have been developed without an understanding of how AAT influences the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in and around the tumor core and the subsequent delivery of novel chemotherapeutic agents across the BBB. During gliomagenesis, expression of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors promotes development of an immature tumor vasculature with partial BBB disruption. AAT-mediated inhibition of VEGF signaling can restore tight junction integrity and potentially promote expression of BBB drug efflux transporters, i.e.,  normalize  theBBB vasculature. Many drugs being tested in GBM clinical trials in combination with AAT have limited BBB penetration. Studies in this application will test the central hypothesis that AAT-mediated restoration of BBB integrity may paradoxically reduce delivery of concomitantly administered drugs to the tumor, leading to reduced efficacy. This hypothesis will be tested both in the Mayo panel of primary GBM xenografts and in University of Minnesota-derived genetically engineered GBM models (GEMMs). Aim one will determine the influence of the anti-VEGF antibody, Bev, the VEGFR inhibitor, cediranib, and a novel PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, GNE-317, on brain microvasculature function (perfusion, tight junctions and efflux transport) in primary GBM xenografts and GEMMs. Aim two will examine how anti-angiogenic effects of Bev and GNE-317 alter drug delivery (site-specific pharmacokinetics) for relevant agents that have different BBB permeability characteristics (e.g., temozolomide, erlotinib, GDC-0980 and GNE-317). We hypothesize that AAT will have a variable detrimental impact on delivery and resultant efficacy depending on the combination therapy. Aim three will test two distinct strategies to improve the efficacy of combination therapies: a) disruption of BBB efflux transporter activity to enhance the efficacy of AAT-transporter substrate combinations, and b) manipulation of chemical structure to reduce efflux liability and increase passive permeability to enhance efficacy of AAT + PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combinations. Many novel agents for GBM being developed in combination with AAT are excluded by the BBB. Thus, understanding the impact of AAT on BBB integrity and drug delivery is critical for successful development of AAT combination therapies for recurrent GBM. The planned studies will define critical parameters that influence the efficacy of AAT combination regimens and use that information to improve patient outcome in future trials that combine anti-angiogenic agents with other novel therapeutics.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is more common in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) than in the general population. Clinical manifestations of PHPT are more severe in vitamin D deficient patients, and even in those with mild disease, patients with low vitamin D levels have higher PTH concentrations and bone turnover markers. Given the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the PHPT population, it is likely that our current understanding of the biochemical and skeletal features of PHPT reflects an admixture of these two conditions. The central hypotheses of this proposal are that in patients with PHPT: 1) Vitamin D deficiency worsens the hyperparathyroid state and is associated with its own specific skeletal features; and 2) Repletion of vitamin D will ameliorate those aspects of the disease that are due to vitamin D deficiency, and thus reveal the true biochemical and skeletal phenotype of the underlying disease. To test these hypotheses, this proposal will utilize state-of-the-art biochemical and skeletal imaging methods. The proposal has the following aims: 1. To compare PHPT patients with and without vitamin D deficiency in order to: a) determine the skeletal features of the hyperparathyroid state that are attributable to vitamin D deficiency; and b) to describe the skeleton in PHPT without the confounding effects of co- existing vitamin D deficiency. 2. To investigate the early effects of high dose vitamin D repletion on histomorphometric parameters of bone remodeling (by quadruple labeled bone biopsy). 3. To investigate the effects of three vitamin D repletion regimens on biochemical, denstometric, microarchitectural and biomechanical features of PHPT. This proposal will fulfill a key mandate of the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism (2008) to obtain more data on vitamin D deficiency in individuals with PHPT. The recently published International Consensus Guidelines on Asymptomatic PHPT (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 94:335-9, 2009) specifically call for measurement of 25- hydroxyvitamin D in all patients with PHPT, and repletion of low levels (<20 ng/ml). However, no recommendations for repletion were included in the Guidelines, because of limited data upon which to base them. This information is urgently needed, as are data on the effects of vitamin D treatment in PHPT upon clinically relevant endpoints such as bone density, skeletal microarchitecture, bone remodeling and bone strength. This proposal will therefore enhance our understanding of the skeleton in PHPT, while providing information that may help in formulating recommendations for vitamin D repletion, a key research goal of the new Consensus Guidelines, and an imperative for clinicians treating this disorder. The ultimate benefit will be to patients with PHPT, for whom clinical decision-making will be strengthened by data that have heretofore not been available.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to effective breast cancer care is a critical factor in Appalachia contributing to health disparities among this population. Poor adherence to adjuvant cancer treatment has been reported to increase risk of death and associated with increased medical costs in breast cancer. Patient medication use behaviors are critical to the cancer heath disparities in Appalachia, and research on essential medication use and quality in rural areas is scant. Data suggests that designing an effective intervention targeting determinants of access to cancer care in Appalachia will provide patients an opportunity to receive appropriate medical treatment to alleviate disparity in cancer morbidity and mortality. The major impact of this study will be the production of a concrete intervention design aimed at reducing cancer health disparities in Appalachia by targeting modifiable contributors such as accessibility of medical care, quality and quantity of pharmacological treatment delivery, and adherence behaviors and their determinants. The purpose of this application includes an innovative approach to model accessibility to cancer care resource influences guiding appropriate treatment delivery and medication use behaviors (persistence and adherence to prescribed treatment), and how such factors impact cancer survival. Our central hypothesis is that patients who are able to access adequate medical care are more likely to receive standard treatments and persistently follow recommendations which lead to better therapeutic outcomes (such as survival). The strategies proposed will address the following specific aims: 1) Assess the complexity of the relationship between access to cancer care resources and patient prescribed guideline appropriate for adjuvant cancer treatments, 2) Delineate the manner in which specific social, system-specific, and individual determinants of access to cancer care affect patient medication use behaviors of persistence and adherence, and 3) Model cancer survival as a function of patient and system specific dimensions of access to cancer care, prescribing guideline appropriate adjuvant treatment and medication use behaviors. This study will use a unique NCI-funded linked dataset of 7,566 patients with breast cancer assembled from cancer registries, Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare claims data, US Social Security Administration's Death Master File (DMF), American Medical Association (AMA) Master file for information on physician and practitioners, American Hospital Dictionary (AHD) for healthcare facility characteristics. We hypothesize that there are modifiable individual and health-system related factors that impact the patient's receipt of optimal pharmacological treatment. The rationale for the proposed study is that, once medication access and utilization factors to which disparity in cancer survival can be attributed, are identified and accurately modeled, effective interventions targeting influential factors for breast cancer survival can be developed and tested in the same population and adapted to other populations burdened with similar inequalities, resulting in reducing health disparity in Appalachia and other regions.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal application is designed to obtain extended follow-up of a unique cohort of asymptomatic patients with rotator cuff tears from which substantial and encouraging data has been obtained. The broad aim of this proposed research is to determine the natural history of rotator cuff disease and factors important in the clinical deterioration of tears. This information is fundamental for determining proper surgical indications and optimizing outcome. These patients offer a rare opportunity to determine risk factors for tear degeneration over time as treatment intervention has not been necessitated by the onset of symptoms. Additionally, we aim to establish two new follow-up cohorts which should provide important adjunctive information regarding partial-thickness tear progression and the relationship between the development of fatty degeneration with tear size, tear location and the development of new pain. Our specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: To obtain long-term follow-up of full-thickness tears to evaluate factors important for tear deterioration and symptom development. A population of 89 individuals identified as having unilateral asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have been followed for minimum period of 2 yrs. Important information regarding alteration in glenohumeral kinematics, rate of tear enlargement, changes in muscle strength and fatty degeneration are anticipated with longer-term follow-up. These patients will be followed with yearly radiographic, outcome, ultrasound and clinical exams for up to 10 yrs. Specific Aim 2: To determine the probability of partial tear progression to full-thickness tears. For 48 individuals previously enrolled with partial-thickness rotator cuff tears and 50 new recruitment patients, yearly high resolution ultrasound exams will be performed to determine the risk of complete tear degeneration. Specific Aim 3: To longitudinally follow full-thickness tears to determine factors important to the development of fatty degeneration. Fatty degeneration of rotator cuff muscles is an irreversible phenomenon associated with decreased healing and outcome following surgical treatment. Ultrasound will be employed to assess what factors such as tear location, tear size, and patient age may be important in the development of fatty degeneration. To date, data from the enrolled population of patients with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears have provided a wealth of new information regarding the natural history of cuff disease and important factors for surgical indications. The proposed project could be an important next step in understanding the natural history of cuff disease and innovative in that a unique study population of asymptomatic tears and partial tears will be longitudinally followed during an extended time of symptom development and tear deterioration with fatty degeneration. With the proposed study design, risk factors for irreversible tendon or muscle deterioration will be studied. This knowledge is important to determine the necessity for early operative treatment.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Disease related to CDI ranges from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrheal disease to severe pseudomembranous colitis. Despite the extensive characterization of the histologic lesions associated with C. difficile infection, virtually nothing is known mechanistically about the contribution of host factors in disease. It is likely that some of the clinical differences encountered in infected individuals are due to variation in host response to colonization with C. difficile. We hypothesize that variation in the host innate and adaptive responses for C. difficile are in part responsible for the different clinical phenotypes that are seen in the setting of CDI. Furthermore, we speculate that these variable responses reflect underlying genetic and possibly epigenetic differences in the host. To address these hypotheses we propose the following specific aims: In the first aim we will characterize the innate and adaptive immune response to C. difficile colonization and determine the role of this response in determining the disease manifestations. In the second aim we will identify serum fecal biomarkers and epigenetic changes that correlate distinct clinical outcomes. This aim will examine samples obtained from the Project area #1 for this purpose. The third aim will examine the interaction between host genetics/immune response and C. difficile genotype in the pathogenesis of disease. Mice with defined differences in host response will be challenged with C. difficile strains generated and characterized from the human studies in Project area #1. This will provide an examination ofthe relative contribution of host and pathogen factors in disease. These experiments will increase our understanding ofthe host and microbial mechanisms of C. difficile-induced colonic inflammation vs. asymptomatic colonization and identify biomarkers that can be used to improve clinical treatments and outcomes.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need for objective markers of progression from genital tract infection to tissue damage resulting in morbidities of chronic pelvi pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy and premature delivery. The long term goal of the proposed research is to develop methods to prevent sexually transmitted infection and reproductive tract sequelae in women exposed to sexually transmitted pathogens that cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The central hypothesis is that biomarkers that predict development of reproductive tract disease or genetic markers of increased risk are present in host inflammatory and repair (fibrogenic) pathways. The objective of this application is to identify these key pathways and develop and validate a predictive clinical instrument based on these biomarkers, with the rationale that this tool can be used to identify vulnerable individuals. To identify candidate biomarkers and risk factors to be integrated into a predictive tool and to test our hypothesis we will pursue the following specific aims during the R21 phase of this proposal: (1) Identify the local inflammatory and fibrotic pathways most strongly regulated during Chlamydia trachomatis infection by performing microarray-based analysis of RNA isolated from endometrial tissue biopsies obtained from women with symptomatic PID. (2) Identify markers for susceptibility to C. trachomatis infection and for progression to tubal pathology by analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to incidence and severity of STI. This contribution is significant because development of this screening tool will directly benefit individuals diagnosed with active STI by identifying those at risk for sequelae arising from even asymptomatic infection. The proposed research is innovative because it combines two complimentary approaches for the identification of biomarkers associated with PID and its sequelae. Achievement of critical milestones: (1) a PID transcript signature, and (2) SNPs associated with genetic traits that predispose to infection and tubal pathology will drive transitin to the translational R33 phase of the proposed research. This will include an unbiased Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) to find genetic variations that further define risk for sequelae and evaluation of a panel of protein candidate biomarkers for their ability to predict inflammationand disease in a clinical setting. In the concluding years, all of the data will be integrated to develop a predictive model that will be tested using two geographically defined cohorts of women at high risk for STI and reproductive tract disease. This contribution is significant because development of this screening tool will directly benefit individuals diagnosed with active STI by identifying those at risk for sequelae arising from even asymptomatic infection. It also has broad application to evaluation of novel vaccines and interventions to prevent reproductive morbidities.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and fatal clonal plasma cell (PC) malignancy.  All MM cases are preceded by a highly prevalent asymptomatic premalignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or a less prevalent, more advanced stage called smoldering MM (SMM).  MGUS and SMM patients exhibit significant risk of progression to MM, with rates estimated at 1% and 10% per year, respectively.  Importantly, a diagnosis of MM depends on overt clinical manifestations of serious end-organ damage.  Therefore, treatment is not initiated before evolving MGUS and SMM patients reach an advanced disease stage.  Because currently identified risk factors lack sufficient accuracy to justify treatment initiation of asymptomatic patients using agents with considerable toxicities, our specific goal is to identify accurate biomarkers that detect the earliest stage of PC malignant transformation such that MGUS and SMM patients in the process of progressing can be identified prior to the onset of serious end-organ damage.  A number of useful prognostic factors have been identified, however, the field still lacks an accurate and sensitive biomarker(s) that identifies MGUS and SMM patients who, in spite of being asymptomatic, have begun to progress.  Although MGUS and SMM PCs harbor genetic lesions typical of MM, they can somewhat surprisingly remain remarkably stable for years suggesting the presence of a currently unknown barrier(s) to further expansion.  Because these initial lesions are insufficient to cause symptomatic disease, the critical question that needs to be answered is what are the specific biological/genetic changes that occur to permit the abnormal PC clone to overcome this barrier(s) in patients who progress to MM?  In this regard, it is notable that common themes observed during malignant progression include metabolic changes, remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (ME), and increased cell proliferation, all of which have also been identified in MM.  In preliminary studies, we have obtained provocative evidence that the transmembrane CD147 molecule, also known as EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] inducer), may be playing an important biological role in MM PCs and that its expression may become induced during disease progression.  Thus, we hypothesize that CD147 is not only an exceptionally promising biomarker of MGUS and SMM progression, but that malignant PCs require its expression for growth and survival as well as for its ability to modify the ME in a manner that fosters further disease progression.  Two aims are proposed. Aim 1 will evaluate the ability of PC CD147 expression to identify asymptomatic MGUS and SMM patients with evolving disease.  Aim 2 will elucidate the role of CD147 in MM cell proliferation and modification of the tumor ME.  The overall impact of our study derives from the mechanistic insights that will be gained and the discovery of an important role for CD147 in progression to MM.  Furthermore, demonstration that this molecule is required for disease progression and/or pathogenesis would also foster development of novel targeted therapies to CD147.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A viruses are a major global health concern. Despite annual vaccination programs in the US, 10-15% of the population is infected annually accounting for an estimated 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations. Two classes of antiviral drugs have been approved for influenza prophylaxis and treatment. Alarmingly, the past decade has witnessed the emergence of drug-resistant as well as novel 2009 pandemic (H1N1) and highly pathogenic (H5N1) strains of influenza A. Amantadine-resistance has become so widespread the adamantanes have become all but ineffective. Significant resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has also been observed in some influenza A strains. Thus, there is an urgent need for new and more effective antiviral therapies. Optimally, as adopted for the treatment of other viral diseases, combination drug therapies would be used to provide the most effective prophylaxis and treatment and to inhibit the emergence of drug-resistance. Here we propose to optimize potency and cytotoxicity properties of identified novel hit series compounds that overcome current drug-resistance mechanisms to inhibit both amantadine-sensitive and -resistant forms of the M2 proton channel. Optimization of these chemical series could provide novel broad-spectrum therapeutics for new mono- and combination antiviral drug therapies for influenza A; a designated NIAID high priority area of interest.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposures to chemical threat agents oftentimes induce strong inflammatory tissue responses that contribute to morbidity and prevent tissue repair and recovery. Pulmonary exposures to chlorine trigger a potent inflammatory response resulting in vascular leakage, cardiopulmonary depression, neutrophil infiltration and a pulmonary and systemic hypercytokinemia comparable to the cytokine storm observed in sepsis. Similar inflammatory responses are observed after inhalation exposures to phosgene and acidic (HCl) or alkaline gases (ammonia) and reactive industrial chemicals such as acrolein, and to riot control agents (CS, CN or CR), and following cutaneous exposures to vesicants. Classical anti-inflammatory treatments against chemical injury have focused on interference with target pathways involved in the initiation and maintenance of inflammation. These strategies have only been partially successful, due to the large variety of pathways and pathologies involved. The inflammatory response is divided into three temporal phases, initiation, amplification and maintenance, and resolution. A new area of inflammation research has focused on the process of inflammation resolution, an active mechanism involving the activation of signaling pathways during inflammation initiation, and the later generation of omega 3 fatty-acid derived inflammation-resolving mediators that activate resolution mechanisms. In our preliminary studies we observe that post exposure treatment with Resolvin D1, an inflammation-resolving agent, strongly inhibited skin edema formation and inflammation in mice exposed to the vesicant, CEES, and the electrophilic riot control agent, CS. Our proposed studies are designed to 1: Examine the effects of inflammation-resolving agents in mouse models of cutaneous exposures to vesicants and electrophilic chemical threats and, 2: Study the effects of inflammation-resolving agents on pulmonary injury progression in mice exposed to chlorine and HCl.',\n",
       " 'TB diagnosis in India relies on clinical symptoms, microscopic examination of smears made directly from sputum and/or chest X-rays (CXR). The immune dysfunction caused by HIV-infection alters clinical and radiological presentation of TB, and microbiological confirmation of TB is problematic since HIV+TB+ patients have increased frequency of smear-negative (SN) TB and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Despite being totally treatable with the existing drugs, the poorer performance of insensitive diagnostic tests in HIV+ patients leads to significant under-diagnosis of TB in the very population where TB progression is rapid and often fatal. A simple, rapid test to identify smear-positive (SP) and SN symptomatic or asymptomatic TB in HIV+ patients would have significant impact on TB-related morbidity and mortality.   Five immunogenic proteins of M. tuberculosis that are potential candidates for devising a simple diagnostic test for TB in HIV+ patients have been identified. These are MS, MPT51, PPE55, ESAT6 and CFP10. Antibodies (Abs) to these antigens have been demonstrated at all levels of immune-suppression, regardless of pulmonary manifestations and site of TB in HIV+TB+ patients, and are also detectable in sera of asymptomatic HIV+ patients who progressed to symptomatic TB in the subsequent 2-6 months. Absence of Abs to these antigens in retrospective sera from CD4 T cell-matched HIV+ patients who did not eventually develop TB suggests that in HIV+ patients, these Ab responses signal active TB whether or not clinical symptoms of TB are present and before the bacterial burden reaches the threshold of detection by direct microscopy. In the current studies we propose to evaluate the potential of these Abs to identify SN and SP symptomatic/asymptomatic HIV+TB+ patients in prospective studies and to map their dominant epitopes that are recognized by Abs in Indian patients. For this, we will recruit a cohort of ~200 ART-naive HIV+ patients and investigate them for TB using direct microscopy as well as with decontaminated/concentrated sputum smears, cultures on solid media and NAAT evaluation of sputum, blood and urine (Aim 1); evaluate the presence of Abs to recombinant purified MS, MPT51, ESAT6, CFP10 and PPE55 in serum specimens from the recruited individuals and correlate the presence of Abs with bacteriological confirmation of TB (Aim 2) and identify the immunodominant epitopes on the 5 antigens recognized by serum Abs from Indian patients on peptide microarrays to define peptides that can be used to devise a peptide-based rapid test for TB in Indian HIV+ patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria, caused by four Plasmodium species transmitted between humans and Anopheles mosquitoes, continues to be a major global public health problem. Annually, more than 300-400 million people worldwide develop malaria; each year, malaria kills ~800,000, primarily due to P. falciparum infecting children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is no highly effective, deployable malaria vaccine, and the prevalence of drug-resistant malaria is increasing throughout Africa, Asia and South America, which has been associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Even chloroquine-resistant P. vivax is emerging as a public health problem, mostly in Oceania but occasional cases have been reported elsewhere including in Peru. Alternative strategies for preventing and reducing the human burden of malaria are imperative. A major challenge confronting the malaria field is how to apply advanced genomics-based knowledge towards the amelioration of malaria at both the field level and in the real world setting. This project will take such an approach towards understanding mechanisms of naturally acquired anti-malarial immunity in a low-transmission setting, lessons that may be generalizable to other regions. The major hypothesis to be testing in this project is that asymptomatic parasitemia reflects clinical immunity to which complex interactions of antibody, memory B cells and helper CD4+ T cells contribute. Prior human studies clearly indicate that specific antibodies can mediate at least a reduction in parasitemia, and hence contribute to clinical immunity. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1, To determine differential antibody responses of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax malaria patients to asexual blood stage antigens; 2, To quantify antigen-specific B cell and compare memory B cell phenotypes in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic P. vivax malaria patients; and 3, To compare and quantify antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic P. vivax malaria patients. This project, to investigate the human immune responses of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with P. vivax malaria in the Peruvian Amazon, will be carried out in conjunction with individuals at UC San Diego, La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, UC Irvine, and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia. This project will provide the intensive career development experience that will enable me to obtain state-of-the-art, multidisciplinary training in malaria immunology, with guidance from an internationally-renowned group of mentors with varying and complementary expertise. The implications of this study will extend to P. falciparum and to malaria immunity studies in multiple different contexts of malaria epidemiology and transmission, and provide the basis to extend and continue such work towards more effective malaria vaccine development in the future (i.e. towards research career independent, new R01 grant, etc.)       RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to learn more about how people become immune to malaria. Studying patients with malaria due to Plasmodium vivax in the Amazon of Peru, we will compare people who have become immune to malaria after natural infection to people who are not immune. The results of this study will allow us to better design a vaccine to prevent and perhaps treat malaria.',\n",

To determine transcriptional signatures in whole blood and/or splenic aspirates from active and past cases, and Quantiferon and/or antibody positive asymptomatic infected donors (Project 1), carrying risk versus protective HLA DRB1 allele groups. 2. To determine at mRNA and protein levels ex vivo, and following stimulation/infection of cells in vitro, whether cis-acting regulatory polymorphisms are functional correlates of risk and protective HLA DRB1 allele groups. 3.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies over the last decade have dramatically changed our understanding of the early natural history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by demonstrating convincingly that RA-related autoantibodies are elevated in asymptomatic individuals for at least several years prior to the development of clinically apparent signs and symptoms of RA. This autoantibody positive but asymptomatic phase is then followed shortly before the onset of clinically apparent signs and symptoms of arthritis by the development of increased systemic inflammation that is manifest by elevated serum/plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines. Because of these findings, we now have a general conceptual framework of how the disease develops in its earliest phases. However, despite these gains in knowledge, the initial citrullinated epitopes to which pathogenic B and T cells respond are unknown. This knowledge is critical to our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms that underlie disease development as well as the future design of tolerance-based therapies. We have established a unique cohort of individuals under the umbrella of the Studies of the Etiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA) who are at the highest definable risk for the future development of RA. Two Co-Investigators in this project application, Drs. Robinson and Buckner, have developed novel approaches to identify and characterize antigen-specific B and T cell responses to citrullinated and other RA-related autoantigens. To advance our understanding of the autoimmune response at the earliest time points in the development of RA, we propose to utilize these techniques in high-risk SERA participants and pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim #1. Identify the innate and adaptive immune response modifications that are causally associated with the break in tolerance to citrullinated autoantigens and progression to active disease; Specific Aim #2. Use novel single-B-cell expression techniques to identify the RA-related autoantigens that are targeted in the initial preclinical phases of disease development; and Specific Aim #3. Determine what peptide autoantigens are recognized by T cells in the initial phases of the loss of self tolerance in the preclinical period of disease development.',\n",

The major resource of our center is having access to large families with known PD genes, including those with SNCA, LRRK2, MAPT, GRN, DCTN, TDP-43, FUS, VPS35, elF4G1 and others. Through our collaborative network we also have access to other families with PRKN, PINK1, and other gene mutations. In our large families, many asymptomatic mutation carriers request clinical genetic testing; therefore they are aware of their mutation status. For this project we will consider them first since they are healthy individuals and can easily travel to our center for clinical evaluation and skin biopsy. We will also target affected individuals if their disease is in eariier stages and they can still travel alone or with minimal assistance from a companion. There are also asymptomatic mutation carriers who are unaware of their mutation status that we need to target to fulfill the proposed recruitment. These individuals are willing to participate in the research in a blinded fashion; therefore for this specific situation we will invite another family member who is not a mutation carrier. We will cover the cost of this from other grants. If needed, we will also recruit research subjects from abroad. We will pay their travel costs and will translate our consent form to their native language. We will also provide translation services in our clinic as needed. Mayo Clinic Florida has an International Department on site with interpreters who are able to assist with recruitment and consenting. They are specially trained to explain the complexities of medical procedures. We will use this service to discuss the consent form prior to making the arrangements for travel for the intemational research subjects.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The abundant genetic diversity exhibited by P. falciparum, shaped by host and vector immunity, drug pressure, environmental change? is a key element to its success as a persistent pathogen. Understanding the nature, extent and distribution of genetic diversity and how it changes over time will be key to devising the most efficient and effective control measures for malaria. To date, there is no data on the population genetics of P. falciparium in the southern region of Africa. The overall goal of Research Area C is to establish regional profiles of the population genetics of P. falciparium in the ICEMR study sites. This will be accomplished using array-based and PCR-based approaches that will provide both high- and low-resolution profiles of parasite genetic diversity. In addition to population-based issues, the proven merozoite surface protein-2 (msp2) genotyping assay will be used to assess intra-individual parasite diversity with special emphasis in asymptomatic/silent infection in areas of low transmission. Aim 1) Obtain a high-resolution profile ofthe genotypic differences between parasite isolates within and between ICEMR study sites in order to establish the nature and scope of parasite genetic diversity. A high-density P. falciparum tiling array on the Affymetrix platform will be used for these studies. Aim 2) Implement and refine a PCR-based barcode approach as a simple, cost-effective tool for routinely monitoring changes in the genetic structure of parasite populations in the ICEMR study sites. The barcode will consist of -25 SNPs defined by real time RT PCR. While the barcode will provide a lower resolution genotype than the array-based approach, its lower cost and ease of use will allow a much more comprehensive profile of regional population genetic structure that will facilitate the identification of changes over time due to control measures or other factors. Aim 3) Determine the level and dynamics of parasite clonal diversity within individuals residing in low- and high-transmission areas in the ICEMR study sites. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) will be assessed based on the detection of polymorphisms in the msp2 gene by PCR. Special emphasis will be placed on asymptomatic and silent infections and the role that these individuals may have in transmission. The expectatoin is that the genotyping and MOI data will be used to create models for prediction of genetic diversity influence upon transmission dynamics, drug treatment efforts, and pathogenesis',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor Nrf2 has emerged as a master regulator of a cellular protective mechanism by upregulating antioxidant response element (ARE)-bearing genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, and stress response proteins. Keap1, a substrate adaptor protein for a Cullin3 (Cul3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, tightly regulates the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is constantly targeted for Keap1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation to maintain a low constitutive level in al human organs. Upon activation of the pathway, the enzymatic activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2 downstream genes. Since the discovery of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway in 1999, Nrf2 has been viewed as a  good  transcription factor that protects us from oxidative stress-related diseases, including cancer. The chemopreventive property of Nrf2 has been well documented by the following two facts: (i) many of the well- studied chemopreventive compounds elicit their activities through activation of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway, and (ii) Nrf2-null mice are highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and are no longer protected by chemopreventive compounds. Paradoxically, the  dark side  of Nrf2 has recently been revealed. For instance, somatic mutations that disrupt the Keap1-mediated negative regulation of Nrf2, resulting in a high constitutive level of Nrf2, have been identified in several types of tumors and cancer cel lines, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Furthermore, mounting evidence has emerged, indicating that Nrf2 contributes to chemoresistance, the major obstacle in cancer treatment. The discovery of the  dark side  of Nrf2 has clearly illustrated the urgent need to identify Nrf2 inhibitors and develop them into druggable compounds to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. We have screened a large number of natural products for their inhibition of ARE-luciferase activity using a stable cell line established in our lab, MDA-MB-231-ARE-Luc, containing an ARE (from GST-Ya)-dependent luciferase gene. Using this method, we have identified a plant extract that is able to inhibit ARE-luciferase activity. Furthermore, a pure compound, brusatol, has been isolated from the extract and has been found to inhibit the protein level of Nrf2 and exhibit potent anti-cancer activities. So far, we have obtained a substantial amount of preliminary data demonstrating that brusatol sensitizes several cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and, more significantly, brusatol sensitizes lung cancer xenografts to cisplatin in vivo in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Based on the ability of brusatol to specifically inhibit Nrf2 and sensitize cultured cancer cells and xenografts to cisplatin treatments, we hypothesize that brusatol can enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through inhibition of the Nrf2-dependant protective mechanism. The goal of the proposed research is to further characterize the anti-cancer properties of brusatol using a preclinical lung cancer model and delineate the molecular targets and mechanistic actions of brusatol. The proposed study will not only provide a framework for the development of this Nrf2 inhibitor into a therapeutic drug to combat chemoresistance, but also provide the first Nrf2 inhibitor for basic research in the field, both of which will have profound impacts on human health worldwide. Therefore, the following three aims will be pursued: Aim #1. Characterize the mechanistic actions of brusatol-mediated Nrf2 inhibition Nrf2 is primarily regulated by the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase at the protein level through ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, we will investigate the effects of brusatol on the proteins that may enhance the activity of the E3 ligase, such as the protein subunits of the E3 ligase, as well as regulatory proteins that control the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the ligase complex. Aim #2. Determine the molecular targets of brusatol The target proteins of brusatol will be identified and verified. The biological functions of these proteins, in particular their crosstalk with the Nrf2 signaling pathway, wil be investigated. Most likely, these proteins will directly or indirectly regulate the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase. Aim #3. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of brusatol using an LSL-KrasG12D/+ mouselung cancer model The feasibility of using brusatol as an adjuvant to enhance current cancer treatments and to combat both intrinsic and acquired resistance will be tested in this preclinical model that recapitulates the development and progression of human lung cancer. !  !',\n",

Project 1 will also contribute to assess the role of asymptomatically infected individuals (those who do not progress to disease) in L. donovani transmission. This project will combine field and laboratory work. Two serological surveys of leishmaniasis infection will be done in high transmission areas to identify recent asymptomatic seroconvertors and controls in the study area (see Core C for details). Similariy, VL cases and controls (i.e healthy household contacts) will also be identified and included in the different studies. Project 1 is divided in 4 specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the association of HLA-type with seroconversion and disease progression controlling for several confounders identified in the previous risk factor studies. Aim 2 will use a recently developed quantitative PCR to assess parasite load in different subpopulations (i.e.seroconvertors and seronegative individuals) and assess its influence in progression to VL taking into account genetic and environmental factors. Aim 3 will examine the association between co-infections with other Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) and VL in two case-control studies. (1) An unmatched case-control study comparing Leishmania seropositives with the general population and (2) a matched case-control study comparing VL cases to community controls will be used to assess the effect of filaria- or geo-helminths-L. donovani co-infection on progression to VL. Finally, Aim 4 will contribute to study the role of asymptomatically infected persons by (1) validating a modified SLA-based Quantiferon to detect cellular immune response in asymptomatic individuals and (2) selecting individuals (peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) culture positive) to be included in the xenodiagnosis experiments (see Project 2 for details) .',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients often face high-risk health care decisions about vascular disease, and informed decisions are needed to obtain the best results. Carotid revascularization, via surgical carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting, is among the most frequently performed vascular procedures, and is widely recommended to prevent future stroke. Such treatment is commonly performed for asymptomatic stenosis, where the risk of future stroke is low without intervention, so the potential benefit of intervention is much less than in symptomatic patients. When considering revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis, patients and providers must weigh the up-front risk of surgery against the long-term risk of stroke, taken in the context of the patient's life expectancy. The best decision in ths clinical scenario is revascularization for low-risk patients who will live long enough to benefit from surgery, and medical treatment for higher risk patients with shorter life expectancy. However, providers and policymakers have found it difficult to identify the key variables to inform these decisions, both in terms of the short-term risks of endarterectomy, as well as the long- term risks of stroke or death.  Health IT can be leveraged to support two key facets of this health care decision: (1) short-term surgical risk stratification by using detailed patient and procedural variables, such as those present in a clinical registry, and (2) longitudinal follow-up o assess the effectiveness of the revascularization in preventing stroke during the patient's remaining life. Our group has demonstrated that the first component can be established using real world data from a regional registry, and the second can be achieved in a broad, cost-effective manner by using administrative claims data.  In the present application, we will develop and implement a merged clinical registry and claims health IT tool that will support clinical decision-making, in the ambulatory setting, for patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease. This approach leverages the clinical detail present in registries with the complete follow-up available from administrative claims. Specifically, we will: (1) identify which asymptomatic patients are likely to receive unnecessary carotid revascularization, using a merged registry-claims dataset, and design a Health IT tool to convey these findings to providers, and (2) determine the potential cost savings associated with avoiding unnecessary carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients.  This health IT tool will identify patients who are least likely to benefit from carotid revascularization and allow patients and providers to makemore informed choices in the ambulatory setting regarding medical management versus revascularization. This tool will also serve as a model for broader implementation, through the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative, and will inform policy makers about opportunities for reducing health care expenditures by reducing unnecessary care.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare At the present time it is not known how many carotid endarterectomy (CEA) procedures are performed in the VA on patients with asymptomatic carotid disease and how many are performed on patients with moderate stenosis of the carotid artery. Most importantly, given the advances in medical management in the last 10 years, it is not known for which subpopulations the benefits of these procedures outweigh the risks. This project would address these gaps in our knowledge with respect to CEA. VA patients would benefit from the study because better information would support improved decision making about patient level treatment. Optimal care for carotid disease depends substantially on life expectancy and comorbidity burden. This research would quantify how the presence of comorbid conditions affects the risks and benefits of CEA under current medical management practices. Project Background Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States with about 137,000 deaths attributable to stroke every year. Carotid artery stenosis is one of the principal risk factors for stroke, and patients with severe asymptomatic stenosis have annual stroke rates between 2% and 5%. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the most common procedure performed to alleviate stenosis and prevent stroke with an estimated 99,000 inpatient endarterectomies performed throughout the US in 2006. CEA is also a common procedure performed in the VA. A preliminary tabulation of VA inpatient and outpatient administrative records from FY2009 performed by our study team revealed approximately 10,000 unique VA patients with diagnosis codes for carotid stenosis and 2,500 with procedure codes for CEA. Project Objectives This pilot proposal has two objectives that will support a larger, future proposal. Objective 1. In one test year of data, identify a cohort of VA patients with asymptomatic carotid disease who had no prior carotid revascularization procedures. Extract and code stenosis rates from radiology data. Refine the sample by excluding those with maximum stenosis under 50%, and those over age 80. Determine number of years of data needed to achieve adequate expected statistical power in future proposal. Objective 2. In one test year of data, demonstrate geographic practice pattern variation in likelihood of receiving CEA as a function of medical center effects and distance to the nearest medical center. Control for known factors affecting choice of CEA including comorbidity burden and degree of maximum stenosis. Project Methods The proposed project is a retrospective observational study of secondary data from several sources. Primary data sources include patient-level administrative and claims data from two healthcare systems: VA and Medicare. This study will capitalize on variation in practice patterns to examine which treatments are most effective in patients with varying degrees of carotid stenosis and comorbidity burden. Using a unique national sample of veterans and instrumental variables analysis we will examine the causal relationship between treatment approach and risk-adjusted health outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Carotid artery stenosis is a well-known cause of atheroembolic stroke. Stroke prevention in these patients has been the focus of intense investigation. Cognitive impairment is a more insidious but poorly understood outcome in patients with  asymptomatic  carotid stenosis who have not suffered a stroke. Cognitive function describes how a person produces and controls mental processes such as thinking, learning, and problem solving. It is an important outcome measure that affects patient well-being and their ability to live independent productive lies. It is well-known that cognitive impairment coexists in patients with stroke from carotid stenosis. However, isolated cognitive deficits in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have not been looked for, and have therefore not been reported in any detail.  Asymptomatic carotid stenosis affects 2-12% of people. With 23.4 million veterans in the country, at least 1 million (4.3%) have asymptomatic carotid stenosis and are at risk for cognitive impairment. A subset analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Study found cognitive decline in 34% of 32 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In this proposal, we will define the extent of initial and progressive cognitive impairment in veterans with carotid stenosis who are currently labeled as  asymptomatic  in the absence of a focal neurologic deficit (stroke, transient ischemic attack). Programs to prevent, postpone, or mitigate cognitive impairment in patients with carotid stenosis will depend on the identification of mediators for cognitive impairment. Microembolic brain injury and cerebral hypoperfusion have been associated with cognitive impairment in elderly individuals. Therefore plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion are likely mediators of impaired cognition in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. As part of this proposal, we will identify the biological mechanisms by which carotid stenosis could result in cognitive impairment.  The goal of this proposal is to perform a systematic, adequately powered study to measure the magnitude of cognitive impairment in asymptomatic carotid stenosis, its impact on quality of life, and its potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Information from this study will define an unsuspected morbidity of carotid stenosis and identify subsets of patients at risk for cognitive impairment. It will form the foundation for future studies on prevention, pre-emptive treatment, or rehabilitation of patients with carotid stenosis. It will also improve the selection of patients with carotid stenosis to decrease unnecessary revascularization procedures.  Specific Aim 1 will assess if patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis differ in cognitive function compared to age-matched controls without carotid stenosis but with similar vascular risk profiles. We hypothesize that in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis 50% who survive stroke free for 2 years; the change in overall and domain-specific cognitive function will be significantly different compared to those without stenosis. The study will recruit 284 subjects and will detect a clinically significant difference in cognitive score with 90% power. We will use a novel battery of cognitive tests specifically developed to address the unique issues relating to carotid stenosis. Specific Aim 2 will define plaque-morphometric, biologic, and hemodynamic characteristics that correlate with cognitive impairment in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. We hypothesize that carotid plaque architecture, plaque composition, microembolic counts, serum pro-inflammatory markers, and cerebral hypoperfusion could each mediate cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up period. We will implement a novel clinical 3D B-mode ultrasound imaging technique developed to obtain reliable serial plaque measurements. Specific Aim 3 will measure the impact of cognitive impairment on quality of life. We hypothesize that at 2 years, regardless of plaque features, cognitive impairment will correlate with a reduction in health-related quality of life measures.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYOccupational Asthma (OA) is the most common occupational lung disorder and diisocyanates the mostcommon causes of OA. Despite many years of research, there are no reliable predictors of risk orsusceptibility to diisocyanate asthma (DA). In our current candidate gene association study (NIOSH RO1),we replicated a Korean GWAS study by demonstrating that two SNP variants (rs10762058, rs7088181) ofthe CTNNA3 gene (coding for ¿-catenin) are associated with DA in Caucasian workers. ¿-T-catenin, ¿-and ¿-catenin are cytoplasmic proteins that complex with E-cadherin to form the epithelial junctionalcomplex (EJC), critical in cell-cell adhesion and for maintaining epithelial integrity. In this renewal, wehypothesize that fine mapping of CTNNA3 loci and genotyping other proteins of the EJC will revealgenetic functional variants that define susceptibility for DA among exposed workers. To test thishypothesis, we will use sequence capture and next generation DNA sequencing of 170 kB of the CTNNA3locus containing rs10762058 and rs7088181 to identify new candidate SNPs with higher allelefrequencies in DA+ workers compared to comparator asymptomatic workers (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we willgenotype tagging SNPs (tSNP) within E-cadherin, ¿, ¿ and ¿ catenin genes with an r2=0.8 and minorallele frequency e 0.1. These and SNPs identified by DNA sequencing will be tested for associations withconfirmed DA (n=150) versus two comparator groups of 150 asymptomatic workers (AWs) exposed tomethylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). All DA-associated SNPswill be re-genotyped and replicated in a distinct background population of 73 Korean workers with DAand 100 AWs. Finally (Aim 3), the possible functional role of replicable DA associated SNPs will bestudied by measuring myc-tagged CTNNA3 protein expression in A549 cells transfected with constructscontaining different coding region SNPs. The allele-specific changes in the expression of CTNNA3 will bedetected by Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody. This novel approach can identify functionalDA-associated genotypes that will enable identification of exposed workers at highest risk and definesafe exposure levels for genetically susceptible workers.',\n",
       " 'This project will address the Overarching Challenge of development of effective treatments and addressing mechanisms of resistance for men with a high risk of prostate cancer (PCa).  The Focus Area will be Therapy.  Nevertheless, elements of the other Overarching Challenges and Focus Areas will be present in that a tool for detecting clinically relevant disease in asymptomatic men and new imaging agents will be generated.  This broad applicability of the proposed work derives from it being a platform technology, i.e., one in which various modules can be switched out depending on the application.  Radical new agents capable of imaging and therapy at the same time, i.e.,  theranostics,  for prostate cancer (PCa) are proposed that leverage the cancer specificity of certain gene promoters.  A gene promoter is the part of a gene that turns on the rest of the gene to produce proteins necessary for the cell.  The promoters described here, however, are only active in the presence of cancer -- not normal tissues or inflammation.  New reagents that can detect the presence of PCa in urine as well as image -- and potentially treat -- micrometastatic disease are proposed.  The promoters, known as the progression elevated gene-3 (PEG-Prom) and astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-Prom) have not been used in vivo for PCa, but this technology is feasible because the promoters are activated by transcription factors present in a wide variety of cancers, including prostate, and it has been shown that in vivo imaging is possible with these reagents when delivered systemically using a commercial polyethyleneimine (l-PEI) nanoparticle that has been in clinical trials.  Focusing this on PCa rather than other tumors is particularly important for two primary reasons: (1) unlike other cancers, PCa is not as readily amenable to molecular imaging due to its relatively indolent nature and lack of avidity for the current standard clinical method, namely, positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose; and, (2) biomarkers such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may indicate the presence of disease, but (a) may be inaccurate, causing the emerging perception of over-treatment of PCa, and (b) will not identify the location of the disease, such that further tests must be done to determine tumor burden and ultimately, therapy (systemic vs. localized).  Because a platform technology with exchangeable modules is proposed, diagnosis, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as therapy, can all be effected by similar agents, merely by switching out the promoter or  reporter  used to detect it.  The hypothesis to address is that PCa will be able to be detected in urine of tumor-bearing animals with high sensitivity and that the same agent, after switching out the reporter gene, can be used both for imaging and molecular radiotherapy.  The in vitro reporter will be secreted beta-hCG, while the in vivo reporter will be HSV1-TK.  While the former will be detected with an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test, the latter will be used in conjunction with [125I]FIAU for imaging and [211At]FAAU for therapy of metastatic prostate cancer.  211At is preferred to 131I because of the high linear energy transfer (LET) and consequent efficacy of alpha-particle irradiation (211At) vs. beta-particle irradiation (131I).  Furthermore alpha-particle irradiation is ideal for micrometastatic disease, which can be used in patients with biochemical-(PSA)-only recurrence as might be detected with the proposed urine test.  To summarize the ultimate clinical goals of this project: (1) a commercially available nanoparticle that has been in clinical trials will contain a gene promoter that will turn on only when it comes into contact with PCa; (2) the gene promoter will start producing secreted beta-hCG, which can be detected with a urine pregnancy test, effectively turning a pregnancy test strip into a device for cancer detection; (3) one can switch out the secreted beta-hCG for HSV1-TK and then inject the patient with imaging or therapeutic versions of FIAU to enable imaging or therapy of PCa -- potentially in asymptomatic men.',\n",

       " 'While it is clear that HIV-1 assembly occurs predominantly on the plasma membrane (PM), the itinerary that the Gag precursor follows to reach its destination remains ill defined. Likewise, the host cell machinery that promotes Gag trafficking to the PM is incompletely understood. We and others have demonstrated that the matrix (MA) domain of Gag regulates targeting to the site of virus assembly, and we discovered that the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 and the ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) serve important functions in directing Pr55Gag to the PM. We are actively engaged in studies to elucidate further the cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 Gag trafficking. This effort combines virology, biochemistry, cell biology, and imaging techniques and is also being extended to the nonprimate lentiviruses equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Proteins of particular interest in this area include the Arf proteins, SNAREs, F-BAR domain proteins, clathrin, and FLJ90680. In studies related to Gag trafficking, we are also investigating the host cell machinery required for Gag localization to, and virus transfer across, the virological synapse. The viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins are incorporated into virions during the assembly process. We have shown that point mutations in the MA domain of Gag block Env incorporation, and demonstrated that the long gp41 cytoplasmic tail plays a cell-type-dependent role in Env incorporation. Despite the evidence for a direct interaction between MA and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail, the molecular mechanism by which Env is incorporated and the basis for cell type dependence of cytoplasmic tail function remain to be defined. We will address the hypothesis that host cell factors are likely to play an important role in Env incorporation into virions. We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay for Gag-Env interaction that will be useful in evaluating this hypothesis.

       " 'Obesity is a huge and increasing medical problem, with inadequate therapeutic options.  One approach to the treatment of obesity is long-term pharmacotherapy.  While only one modestly effective drug marketed in the United States (orlistat), two drugs have recently been approved by the FDA (lorcaserin, Qsymia).  The limited efficacy of single agents has lead to the idea that combination therapy will be required.  To facilitate combinations, we are testing the physiology of dinitrophenol (DNP) as a model system for chemical uncoupling as a treatment of obesity.  We are currently designing animal protocols that will use mice to explore combination therapy for obesity.  A specific interest is the rational combination of a centrally (brain) acting drug with one that acts peripherally (outside of the brain). This approach has potential to allow use of lower doses of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, minimizing adverse effects while maintaining weight reduction efficacy, via targeting of both metabolic rate and food intake.We are also exploring the use of mice housed under thermoneutral conditions to see if this provides a metric of efficacy translatable into humans.',\n",

We have extended and replicated our earlier findings by demonstrating that women with PMD (n = 35), who respond to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced ovarian suppression experience a recurrence of PMD after the initial re-exposure to combined estradiol and progesterone.  However, recurrent symptoms do not occur once hormone levels are stabilized over the subsequent two months of continuous replacement therapy.  These observations are of both clinical and scientific importance, as they identify promising phenotypes and suggest the physiologic basis for the susceptibility to experience PMD and will also provide alternative hormone-based therapies for women with this condition.  In addition to our studies on the behavioral effects of changes in ovarian steroids across the menstrual cycle and during the postpartum, we employ methodologies to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms of these conditions including studies investigating positron emission tomography (PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  First, our neuroimaging studies have identified both a neural substrate of risk in PMDD as well as a brain-region specific response that could underlie the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids in this condition.  We performed O15 PET and fMRI studies in women who are participating in the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism study.  In this study, cognitive activation was achieved using the N-back test which allows us to vary the cognitive load and the effort required to perform the task.  We observed that women with PMD show abnormal prefrontal recruitment, specifically greater activation than controls throughout the DLPFC bilaterally.  These findings are robust and observable in both 015 PET and fMRI techniques.  In both imaging modalities, significantly increased DLPFC activations in PMDD compared with controls occurred in all three hormone conditions and, therefore, were independent of hormone condition.  Moreover, DLPFC activations in PMDD correlated negatively with measures of PMD functional impairment (i.e., global assessment of functional impairment GAF scores), age of onset of PMDD, and baseline (prior to Lupron) symptom severity measures  the greater the over-activation, the greater the disability, the earlier age of onset, and the more severe baseline symptomatology.  Our findings suggest that these persistent effects, even in the clinically asymptomatic phase of the hormone-manipulation paradigm (i.e., Lupron alone), may represent an enduring, trait-like predisposition to this hormonally-triggered disorder.  By identifying the prefrontal cortex, specifically the DLPFC, as key in the pathophysiology of PMDD, these data provide insight into potential neural mechanisms contributing to this disorder.  Women with PMD (n = 19) and controls (n = 32) underwent resting state PET studies during each of the three hormone conditions.  We observed significant diagnosis by hormone interactions in the subgenual cingulate (BA25), medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC), and right hippocampal/parahippocampal region.  Post-hoc analyses revealed that in PMD higher resting rCBF was present during hypogonadism (when PMD symptoms are in remission) compared with estradiol or progesterone replacement (when PMD symptoms are at risk of recurring), whereas the opposite pattern (i.e., lower resting rCBF during hypogonadism compared with either estradiol or progesterone) was observed in controls who experience no change in mood across identical hormone conditions.  These data demonstrate for the first time a differential pattern of rCBF within a neuroanatomical locus implicated in the process of affective adaptation.  Additionally, the fact that the changes in rCBF correspond in time to the hormone state-related changes in symptoms raises the possibility that the changes in rCBF may reflect the altered mood state rather than a direct effect of hormonal state.We collaborate with Drs. Rima Kaddurah-Daouk at Duke University and Thomas Hankemeier at Leiden University to more comprehensively examine the profile of steroid and steroid metabolites with a metabolomics platform employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy.  Our strategy is to perform metabolomic studies in women with PMD who respond to Lupron with elimination of symptoms and who experience return of symptoms during progesterone or estradiol replacement.  Thus, we wish to specifically examine the effects of both estradiol and progesterone on the pattern of steroid metabolites in women with PMD and an asymptomatic comparison group.  Our metabolomic and neuroimaging studies will be complemented by a new series of functional genomic studies performed in collaboration with David Goldman's laboratory at NIAAA, in which we employ lymphoid and fibroblast cell-lines obtained from women with PMD and controls who participate in our Lupron studies.  We hypothesize that the capacity for phenotypic differences between women with and those without PMD will be preserved in their cellular function.  These experiments allow us to explore the nature of the differential behavioral response by examining protein expression and changes in cellular behaviors associated with the exposure to physiologic levels of either estradiol or progesterone across the two different behavioral phenotypes (women with PMD who experience a remission of PMDD during ovarian suppression and a recurrence of PMDD when ovarian steroids are added back, and controls who are asymptomatic during all three hormone conditions).  Preliminary results show that women with PMD express more estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (but not beta) compared with controls (consistent with our findings of differential ER alpha allele frequency in PMD compared with controls observed in a prior study).  Additionally, RNA sequencing strategies investigate the response to steroid hormone exposure in immortalized lymphoid cells in these same groups of women.  We observed statistically significant, quantitative and widespread differences in the PMDD transcriptome compared to a carefully selected asymptomatic control group.  Our analyses identified several molecular pathways that appear to be altered in women with PMDD; one of these pathways, the chromatin modifying ESC/E(z) complex, is of particular interest as a potential candidate since it is regulated by estradiol and leads to genomic regions of transcriptional repression.  The mechanism by which these pathways converge and possibly alter CNS function sufficient to manifest in PMDD will be the focus of our future studies in induced neuronal and glial cells.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Occupational Asthma (OA) is the most common occupational lung disorder and diisocyanates the most common causes of OA. Despite many years of research, there are no reliable predictors of risk or susceptibility to diisocyanate asthm (DA). In our current candidate gene association study (NIOSH RO1), we replicated a Korean GWAS study by demonstrating that two SNP variants (rs10762058, rs7088181) of the CTNNA3 gene (coding for catenin) are associated with DA in Caucasian workers. T-catenin and catenin are cytoplasmic proteins that complex with E-cadherin to form the epithelial junctional complex (EJC), critical in cell-cell adhesion and for maintaining epithelial integrity. In this renewal, wehypothesize that fine mapping of CTNNA3 loci and genotyping other proteins of the EJC will reveal genetic functional variants that define susceptibility for DA among exposed workers. To test this hypothesis, we will use sequence capture and next generation DNA sequencing of 170 kB of the CTNNA3 locus containing rs10762058 and rs7088181 to identify new candidate SNPs with higher allele frequencies in DA+ workers compared to comparator asymptomatic workers (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will genotype tagging SNPs (tSNP) within E-cadherin, and catenin genes with an r2=0.8 and minor allele frequency e 0.1. These and SNPs identified by DNA sequencing will be tested for associations with confirmed DA (n=150) versus two comparator groups of 150 asymptomatic workers (AWs) exposed to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) or hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI). All DA-associated SNPs will be re-genotyped and replicated in a distinct background population of 73 Korean workers with DA and 100 AWs. Finally (Aim 3), the possible functional role of replicable DA associated SNPs will be studied by measuring myc-tagged CTNNA3 protein expression in A549 cells transfected with constructs containing different coding region SNPs. The allele-specific changes in the expression of CTNNA3 will be detected by Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibody. This novel approach can identify functional DA-associated genotypes that will enable identification of exposed workers at highest risk and define safe exposure levels for genetically susceptible workers.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Salmonellae are Enterobacteriaceae that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans and animals, including enteric (typhoid) fever and gastroenteritis. Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is a life-threatening systemic disease that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality annually worldwide. Approximately 3-5% of individuals infected with S. Typhi become chronic carriers with the gallbladder (GB) as the site of persistence. S. Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen, therefore asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for further spread of disease. We have demonstrated that gallstones aid in the development and maintenance of GB carriage in a mouse model and in humans, serving as a substrate to which salmonellae attach and form a protective biofilm. However, the molecular basis of chronic carriage of Salmonella in the GB, both from the host and bacterial perspectives, is poorly understood. Our goal is to better understand the environment that allows for asymptomatic chronic carriage and to develop therapies to reverse/prevent it. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will examine the ongoing dynamics of the GB response to Salmonella colonization in our gallstone mouse model to better understand the role of the host in permitting asymptomatic chronic carriage. We will also expand preliminary data implicating IL-10 in the development of GB chronic colonization. In Aim 2, we intend to examine the response and adaptation of the bacterium throughout the establishment of chronic infection, including genes specifically expressed in carriers and putative GB-driven adaptive mutations, in enhancing biofilm formation and colonization. In Aim 3, we will initiate development of novel treatments for chronic carriage that have emerged from our discovery research efforts. These approaches target kinases required for biofilm formation and the gallstone itself. This work will identify key host and bacterial factors at play during chronic infection of the GB by Salmonella, thus presenting new targets for therapeutic/preventive approaches to eliminate the carrier state.',\n",

A comparison group of 24 high school athletes with orthopedic injury (OI) will also be recruited. Weekly assessment via telephone of post-concussion symptoms will identify athletes who are asymptomatic by one month and cleared for RTP. At one month post-injury both groups will return to clinic for neurobehavioral assessment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional connectivity (FC) of brain regions. Data analysis will test between-group differences in integrity of white matter tracts (DTI) and FC of brain regions.

Drug use rate are highest among Hispanic middle school youth and to date there are few if any treatments that have been proven effective with substance abusing Hispanic adolescents. Further treatment for Hispanic youth and families is complicated by the fact that these families often differ from mainstream drug users in values, beliefs and behaviors that can directly impact engagement, retention, and efficacy/effectiveness of drug treatment. Our efforts to develop and fully test a more powerful treatment that can address these issues began with a Stage 1 study that: 1) led to the development of a flexible manual that allows treatment tailoring to the unique family characteristics, 2) showed highly promising feasibility and acceptability indicators (Santisteban and Mena, in press) and 3) showed highly promising preliminary outcomes on both drug use and family-level hypothesized mediators (Santisteban et al., unpublished manuscript). This application proposes a Stage II randomized trial with 220 Hispanic youngsters' ages 14-17 meeting criteria for drug abuse and their families. The study will test the treatment's efficacy compared to a control condition, in impacting drug use, risky sexual behavior, and hypothesized mechanisms (family functioning and therapeutic alliance) of change, in a larger and more rigorous trial. The study also includes a test of the dose-response relationship and exploration of moderators of treatment outcome. This application responds to a Program Announcement (PA-07-111) that outlines as areas of interest  ...women, minorities, families, couples, specific cultural groups, adolescents...  The Stage II trial focuses on a treatment designed to boost the treatment effects by building in a flexible tailoring process to better address the specific needs of: 1) adolescents, 2) minorities and a special cultural group - Hispanics, via a treatment that works with 3) couples and families.\",\n",

The career development plan will increase Dr. Shepherd's knowledge and skills in 1) pathologic and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 2) advanced MRI techniques for clinical imaging, and 3) clinical research methodology (including training in scientific integrity and the responsible conduct or research). This will be achieved via highly-structured mentoring, multidisciplinary coursework and seminars across multiple institutions at New York University (NYU). Mentorship will be provided by Fernando Boada, Steven Ferris and Thomas Wisniewski, who are each internationally recognized for their contributions to advanced MRI techniques, clinical and pathological changes in early Alzheimer's disease respectively. Dr. Shepherd also will be mentored by Robert Grossman, the Dean of NYU School of Medicine, a highly-successful clinician- scientist and role model in Dr. Shepherd's clinical specialty. Els Fieremans, a key collaborator is an expert in diffusion kurtosis MRI and modeling. An advisory committee will provide quarterly feedback to Dr. Shepherd and assess his progress so that he meets his training objectives, produce high quality data and publications, and develops a competitive application for RO1 funding at the end of the K23 career development period. The K23 research plan will test the overall hypothesis that targeted high-resolution MRI can distinguish pathological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures known to be affected early in the disease process. Previous work has demonstrated that structural MRI can be sensitive to the local functional organization of normal tissue and suggests AD pathology changes to tissue organization also will be detectable. The project consists of 2 aims; 1) correlate the hallmarks of AD pathology to changes in the MRI properties (diffusion kurtosis, white matter integrity and T2) of MTL substructure tissue samples (e.g. entorhinal cortex), and 2) use targeted MRI of the MTL to characterize MRI property changes in a cross- sectional study of subjects categorized to different preclinical and clinical stages of AD. This project incorporates multiple innovations that suggest the impact of structural MRI as a biomarker for AD has been underestimated in the past; 1) specifically targeting MTL structures known to be sequentially involved by early AD pathology in asymptomatic patients, 2) novel parallel transmission MRI technology to obtain accurate diffusion data in the MTLs, 3) advanced models of T2 relaxation, diffusion kurtosis and white matter microstructure to better detect local changes in functional tissue organization by AD pathology. Results may warrant further NIH-supported investigation of region-specific targeted MRI as a noninvasive biomarker to diagnose underlying AD pathology and disease progression for asymptomatic patients.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeffDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to examine the clinical presentation and biomarkers that accompany chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts. A history of repetitive head impacts is a necessary factor in the development of CTE, though it is not a sufficient cause of the disease. The specific head impact exposures, other modifying risk factors (e.g., genetics), and incidence and prevalence of CTE remain unknown. To be able to address these critical issues, as well as to begin clinical trials, it is necessary to develop methods of detecting and diagnosing CTE during life and distinguish it from other clinically similar presentations. This proposed investigation is a continuation of the Diagnosing and Evaluating Traumatic Encephalopathy with Clinical Tests (DETECT) project. Our study population will include 110 former NFL players (high exposure to head impacts; HE) and 30 former elite non- contact sport athletes (low exposure to head impacts; LE). The HE group includes symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects; the LE group includes only asymptomatic subjects. All subjects will undergo a two-day evaluation, including clinical examinations (neurological, motor, cognitive, mood and behavioral evaluations), blood draw (for genetic sequencing and genotyping of APOE, MAPT, and MAO-A), EEG, lumbar puncture (CSF tau, p-tau, and Abeta42; monoamine metabolites), and neuroimaging (including volumetrics, cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging, free water imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Specific tests were chosen to maximize the ability to share and compare data through datasets such as the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) informatics system and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. For the 80 subjects (60 HE and 20 LE) who previously participated in the initial DETECT study, this evaluation will serve as a 3-yr follow-up. The remaining former HE and LE subjects will return for a 3-yr follow-up evaluation within this study cycle. We will also examine 20 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease and 20 individuals with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD). AD and MCI subjects will have no contact sport or TBI history and will only receive a single evaluation for ths study; their data are only for cross-sectional comparison purposes. This project will utilize a multi-modal approach evaluating the relationship between head impact exposure and later-life clinical and biomarker outcomes, taking into account potential modifying variables. Additionally, expanding the cohort to include individuals with AD and MCI as well as older and asymptomatic HE and LE subjects will provide a more comprehensive picture of the repercussions of repetitive head impacts, and the factors that differentiate CTE from other disease processes. Furthermore, longitudinal evaluation will allow for important examination of the progression of clinical course and biomarker outcomes. Given the millions of Americans who participate in contact sports at all levels of play this study has the potential to have a tremendous impact on public health.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall theme and objective of this Center is to develop new classes of host-targeting antiviral therapeutics that are capable of treating multiple NIAID Emerging and Re-emerging Priority Pathogen viruses, when used alone or in combination with other available agents. The range of planned activities spans the translational development spectrum: from generating new host target focused leads, to validating promising lead molecules, and advancing optimized leads. We hypothesize that a collection of exciting preliminary datasets now offer the potential to be collaboratively translated into the development of novel broad spectrum antivirals. More specifically, we will test the following hypotheses: 1) human haploid genetic screens can identify novel host genes required for multiple RNA viruses, and recombinant AAV viral vectors can both validate these targets and serve as development candidates against the identified genes; 2) a suite of novel computational methods can identify compounds with affinity for dominant drug targets and thereby yield new antiviral therapies based on poisoning essential oligomeric viral or viral-host protein complexes; 3) recent insights into the mechanistic basis of how interferons engage their receptors and transduce their antiviral gene expression program can be leveraged into the development of interferons with novel antiviral properties, and that a unique small molecule inhibitor of PDE12 2' phosphodiesterase (A-74528) can prolong the antiviral programs generated by both these novel and currently approved interferons (IFNs); 4) the apparent widespread dependence of RNA viruses on specific intracellular pools of phosphoinositides such as PI4P and PI4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) can be translated into an effective host cell based antiviral therapy via the development of appropriate small molecule inhibitors of specific PI4- and PIP5- kinases; 5) the development of novel countermeasures against RNA viruses can be accelerated through repurposing of existing approved drugs, and that the same type of meta-analysis of high throughput (HT) molecular measurements that has uncovered new opportunities for treating transplant rejection and fatty liver can be applied to infectious diseases and thereby yield a pipeline for identifying novel hosttargets upon which viruses depend and that can be inhibited with approved drugs; 6) the therapeutics contemplated above can be used in combination to achieve still more potent, broad-spectrum antiviral therapies with high barriers to resistance\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous clinically used agents contain the ester chemotype, a moiety frequently added to small molecules to improve their water solubility and bioavailability. However the inclusion of this function in these compounds makes them substrates for carboxylesterases (CEs), enzymes that can either inactivate or activate these agents. Typically examples include the anticancer agent CPT-11 (irinotecan, Camptosar) that is a prodrug of SN-38, a potent topoisomerase I poison, and the antiviral drug oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) that requires hydrolysis to the carboxylate form to yield the active neuraminidase inhibitor. Hence, compounds that might inhibit the hydrolysis reactions would limit the efficacy of these drugs. We have identified a class of compounds (tanshinones) that are present within the Chinese herbal medicine Danshen. Extracts from this material can potently inhibit human CEs and modulate drug activity in vitro. Importantly however, the FDA has just approved the use of Danshen in clinical trials. Hence any esterified drug that is administered in conjunction with the herbal medicine might lead to reduced molecule hydrolysis, thereby mitigating the efficacy of the agent. We seek therefore, to evaluate the active component(s) in Danshen and to assess whether these molecules can modulate drug activity in defined animal models. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To determine the inhibitory compounds present within Danshen; 2) to assess the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by these compounds; 3) to assess the biological activity of these extracts in vitro; and 4) to determine the effect of such compounds/extracts on drug efficacy in animals models. We anticipate that compounds present within Danshen will inhibit the CEs in vivo, resulting in significantly reduced drug hydrolysis, and as a consequence, reduced drug efficacy. Since this material is currently in clinical trials, the information derived from these studies may identify novel drug:drug interactions that potentially would impact the effectiveness of clinically used esterified compounds. We envisage that the studies proposed here will validate this hypothesis and provide information concerning the use of such extracts in defined patient populations.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal uses proteomics to better understand Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis with a large-scale, unbiased, and direct approach to discover and validate novel disease processes in postmortem AD brain, and to prioritize new targets for early stage therapeutic intervention. The AD proteome mediates the effects of aging, genetics and other risk factors and contains unidentified protein targets for therapies. The approach leverages the strengths of a national team of collaborating AD Centers and associated studies of aging, an innovative proteomics platform, advanced systems biology, and model systems to produce new treatment targets. The first aim will identify novel proteomic targets selectively altered in asymptomatic AD brain. Brains will be analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS), yielding discovery proteomes to compare 1) controls free of AD and other pathologies; 2) asymptomatic controls with AD pathology; 3) non-demented mildly impaired cases with AD pathology, 4) definite AD, and 5) other neurodegenerative diseases. Protein changes in synapses, insoluble aggregates, glial and neuron-specific nuclei, and select posttranslational modifications will be determined. Bioinformatics will be used with available large-scale data to identify potentially druggable targets in key networks and cellular processes. The second aim will validate candidate proteomic targets in postmortem brains from independent community and clinic-based cohorts and determine relationships with clinicopathological features, including cognition. Absolute levels of candidate proteins will be quantified using selected reaction monitoring MS. The third aim will establish links between the validated proteome and AD pathogenesis and druggability. The most promising candidates will be studied for effects on neuronal viability and interactions with Ass and tau using cell culture and drosophila models. These results and other data will drive selection of the most promising candidates to advance to mouse models to assess therapeutic potential.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an attractive model for study because the responsible mutations have known biochemical consequences that underlie the pathological basis of the disorder. The opportunity to determine the sequence of imaging and biomarker changes in asymptomatic gene carriers who are destined to develop AD may reveal critical information about the pathobiological cascade that culminates in symptomatic disease. Because the clinical and pathological phenotypes of autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) appear similar to those for the far more common late-onset  sporadic  AD, the nature and sequence of brain changes in ADAD also may be relevant for late-onset AD. However, individuals with ADAD are few and are geographically dispersed worldwide. In its initial funding period, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) has established an international, multicenter registry of individuals (gene carriers and noncarriers; asymptomatic and symptomatic) who are biological adult children of a parent with a known causative mutation for AD in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes in which the individuals are evaluated at entry and longitudinally thereafter with standard instruments to include the Uniform Data Set of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, structural, functional, and amyloid imaging protocols developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), biological fluids (blood; CSF) in accordance with the ADNI protocols, and histopathological examination of cerebral tissue in individuals who come to autopsy also using ADNI protocols. In addition to establishing the DIAN registry, support was found for DIAN's major hypotheses examined. First, AD biomarker changes will identify MCs many years before these individuals develop symptomatic AD, thus supporting the concept of preclinical AD. Second, the initial biomarker changes in the preclinical stage of ADAD will involve Aß42, followed by changes related to neurodegeneration, followed by cognitive decline. Third, the clinical and neuropathological phenotypes of ADAD will be similar to, but not identical with, those of  sporadic  LOAD. Although data obtained in the initial budget period provide support for each of these hypotheses, all have yet to be confirmed with longitudinal data analyses. Hence, this application now emphasizes longitudinal data collection and analyses to truly appreciate how biomarkers change over time. This renewal application continues to address the 3 original DIAN hypotheses with increased emphasis on longitudinal data (increasing visit frequency for asymptomatic participants) and maintain current aims (maintenance of the established international DIAN registry of individuals (MCs and NCs, symptomatic and asymptomatic) with attention to preparing and adjusting for participants who participate in current and planned prevention trials. New scientific studies are planned; many funded independently of the DIAN grant and conducted within the DIAN infrastructure at no cost to DIAN.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Establishing a transcriptional pathway for cell-fate and synaptic plasticity We hypothesize that the FOXO transcription factor controls motoneuron plasticity across lifespan in Drosophila. FOXOs are evolutionarily conserved proteins that coordinate cellular responses to developmental and environmental stimuli. Well known for their central position in molecular circuits regulating healthy aging and stress responses, their developmental functions have recently come into focus. In particular, FOXOs have emerged as important regulators of brain development. Neuronal functions of FOXOs have been investigated in mice, C. elegans, and Drosophila. To date, these functions include neuronal polarity, morphology, synaptic function, and memory consolidation. Though FOXO proteins are key regulators of multiple aspects of neuronal development and physiology, the neuronal-specific pathways in which they act are as yet undefined. Here we propose to analyze components of a novel neuronal FOXO pathway using combined molecular, genetic, and genome-wide approaches. We will test the hypothesis that FOXO activity is stimulated by Toll-6 signaling to inhibit apoptosis during embryogenesis and promote synaptic organization and plasticity during larval development. Mechanistic under- standing of FOXO's role in these processes requires the identification of its transcriptional targets. To this end, we propose an unbiased large-scale RNA-seq approach to identify the FOXO-dependent transcriptome. Thus, we propose an initial characterization of an entirely novel pathway, as well as a genome-wide screen for effector molecules. Together, these studies aim to define a novel neurotrophic pathway from cell surface to nuclear response in a powerful genetic model system. There is significant interest in modulating both the survival and synaptic functions of neurotrophic pathways in contexts as varied as neurodegenerative diseases, normal aging, and injury. The proposed genome- wide screens for effectors may suggest unexpected and novel players in these critical signaling pathways.\",\n",
       " \"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiple genetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset for AD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individuals with 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetime AD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many of the apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stay asymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the latter group to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk. Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRN mutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how the same mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial for unraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments. Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in human neurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well- characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to study disease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this project are to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to AD pathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How do heterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e., FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., Aβ production/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine the transcriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlying mechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations cause NCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeutic development by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  Four to eight percent of adults have asymptomatic carotid stenosis exceeding 50%. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. Medical therapy has improved. The ACST trial demonstrated that medical management of hyperlipidemia can attenuate the benefits of revascularization in patients with asymptomatic stenosis. Further advances in managing atherosclerotic risk factors may negate benefit that might otherwise be realized through revascularization, making the morbidity of the procedures unjustifiable. Endarterectomy and stenting have also improved. The results for endarterectomy in CREST showed a periprocedural stroke and death rate of 1.4%. For stenting, the rate was the lowest yet reported in a randomized controlled trial, 2.5%, and that rate was improving in the last tertil of enrollment.  We will conduct two parallel randomized, multicenter non-inferiority trials (CREST-2). The primary specific aims will be to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to carotid endarterectomy (n=1050) and also to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management to stenting (n=1050) for patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The primary endpoint will be a composite of any stroke or death within 30 days of randomization plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. Vascular risk factors,including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia, will be managed centrally using modern aggressive targets. Should intensive medical management be declared non-inferior to endarterectomy, stenting or both, up to 5,000 periprocedural strokes may be prevented.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing renewal of our MERIT Award, the central goal is to further the understanding of the occurrence of asymptomatic amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and its progression to clinical cognitive impairment. During the previous eight years we collected Aβ imaging and cognitive data on 75 cognitively normal older adults to determine if the variability in cognition in this group was explained largely by Aβ deposition and found that it was not. This cohort has now matured to the point that the occurrence of incident Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and incident Aβ-positivity [incident-Aβ(+)] is sufficient to address other important hypotheses that could not be properly addressed until sufficient follow-up was in place - as is the case now. One critical hypothesis that we can now test is that Aβ-positive cognitively normal older adults are at high risk to develop clinically-significant cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI) (Aim 1). In addition, our growing cohort of incident-Aβ(+) subjects allows us to observe the transition from being Aβ-negative to the earliest Aβ-positive [Aβ(+)] state (Aim 2.2). This enables us to measure the time spent Aβ(+) and avoids many other limitations of cross-sectional studies. Also, our longitudinal fMRI data in incident-Aβ(+) individuals will allow us to test for the first time the assumption that higher hippocampal activation in Aβ(+) individuals reflects a true increase from baseline, and not just a maintenance of lifelong high activation as suggested by studies of cerebral metabolism and will aid us in predicting when Aβ(+) individuals will develop cognitive decline (Aim 3). Finally, we propose to enhance our cohort to more effectively address the relationship between Aβ deposition and cognition by broadening the cognitive range of our cohort (Aim 2.1). We will do this in an innovative way by adding a group of individuals who do not meet criteria for MCI, but show mild neuropsychological deficits without cognitive or functional complaints. The overall impact and significance of this study will be to further our understanding of: 1) the incidence of asymptomatic β-amyloidosis; 2) the relationships between early Aβ deposition, hippocampal activation and cognition; and ultimately, 3) the relationship of asymptomatic β-amyloidosis and clinical MCI (and the timing of that association). We will continue to employ state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (including the Pittsburgh Compound-B amyloid imaging technology developed by our group) along with both standard and innovative neurocognitive and clinical measures. Innovative aspects of this project include: 1) the study of incident MCI in Aβ(+) individuals; 2) the study of incident-Aβ(+) cases; and 3) the longitudinal study of the natural history of hippocampal activation in incident-Aβ(+) individuals and its relationship to progression to MCI. Completion of our study will result in a predictive model of MCI that will incorporate the Aβ and neurodegenerative parameters of the preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) criteria. This data will aid in the design and interpretation f existing and ongoing prevention trials for AD and thus have great relevance to the major public health threat posed by this disease.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in the field of aging and dementia is the inability to predict asymptomatic individuals who will develop dementia and, in particular, Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal brain changes precede clinical cognitive changes by 10 to 20 years providing a window of opportunity to prevent dementia. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association published guidelines to characterize the pre-clinical and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stages of Alzheimer's disease, placing a major emphasis on biomarkers. However, we have limited information on the prevalence of biomarkers at the population-level in mid-life and late- life, and on their ability to predict cognitive outcomes. Inaddition, the assessment of abnormal brain changes in asymptomatic individuals using imaging biomarkers may not be a cost-effective screening approach for secondary prevention and may not be applicable to all persons. The few risk scores that have been proposed thus far to predict dementia do not assess the risk of MCI and do not consider biomarker abnormalities. The broad, long-term goal of this renewal application is to develop tools to predict and prevent cognitive decline and dementia. To accomplish this goal we propose 4 specific aims: 1) To estimate the prevalence of neuroimaging biomarkers such as brain amyloid accumulation, neurodegenerative pathology, and vascular pathology in a defined population; 2) To prospectively examine the association of these imaging biomarkers with cognitive outcomes; 3) To develop risk scores to predict biomarkers and cognitive outcomes; and 4) To provide data and materials for related projects. To successfully address these gaps in knowledge and to accomplish our study goal, this project will capitalize on 2 unique and established resources available in the Olmsted County, MN population. The population-based and prospective Mayo Clinic Study of Aging has enrolled nearly 4,000 participants to date; of whom over 1,000 have extensive neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration. The Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system is used to recruit population-based samples, to identify demographics and clinical risk factors, to study cognitive outcomes for subjects who could not be studied face-to-face, and to compute weights to adjust for non-participation. At the completion of this project, we will have estimated the population-based prevalence of neuroimaging biomarkers, determined their predictive value for cognitive outcomes, developed a risk score to predict imaging biomarkers, and determined the added predictive value of a risk score that includes neuroimaging biomarkers. These findings will provide critical information for public health planning, endpoints for therapeutic trials, and costeffective tools for the early detection of brain abnormalities and cognitive outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid tumors will not grow beyond 3 - 4 mm in diameter without building up their own blood supply. Due to the essential role of tumor angiogenesis, anti-angiogenesis, mono-therapy or in- combination with other therapeutic agents, represents a very promising approach for cancer treatments. Great successes have been achieved, such as Avastin, a FDA approved anti- angiogenesis drug. However, clinical studies revealed that the cancer patient survival benefits of antiangiogenic drugs have thus far been insignificant. In addition, most current studies in development of anti-angiogenesis agent have been mainly focused on strategies of blocking VEGF/VEGFR signaling. Many agents that are developed against the VEGF/VEGFR pathway often cause unwanted biologic side effects. There is urgent need to develop anti-angiogenesis agents by targeting many other biological pathways that are involved in both stimulation and inhibition of cancer angiogenesis. We have developed a new class of anti-angiogenesis proteins by integrin ¿v¿3 at a novel site, the large pocket formed by the I-domain of ¿v and the PSI domain of ¿3. Computational modeling demonstrated that the domain 1 of rat CD2 and human CD2 spatially fit into the designed site very well. Mutations introduced at the D1-CD2 to bridge several key contacts between designed protein and the integrins optimize the binding of the designed protein with integrin. The designed proteins exhibit strong in vitro activity in induction of apoptosis on endothelial HUVEC cells with no effects on other cells. Tests with tumor nude mice PC-3 xenografts show that the designed proteins strongly inhibit tumor growth. Parallel analyses suggested that our developed protein anti-angiogenesis agents are significantly more effective than Avastin in inhibiting tumor growth. In this proposed research project, we propose experiments to further verify whether the designed protein indeed interact with integrin at the designed site, and whether the designed protein indeed exert its activity by targeting the integrin. We will extensively test the effectiveness of the developed protein anti-angiogenesis agents by various animal models of human cancers. We also design experiments to test whether our developed anti-angiogenesis proteins will have great potency for cancer treatment in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. To facilitate potential future clinical applications, we propose experiments to extensively characterize toxicity and bio-distribution of the protein agents. Our study will lead to development of a new and more effective anti-angigenesis agent for cancer treatment.',\n",
       " 'Institutions based in two malaria-endemic countries, Brazil and Peru, are partnering with a leading research group in the USA with the long-term goal of providing scientific evidence that can be translated into effective public health interventions for malaria control in Amazonia. To determine whether asymptomatic parasite carriage is a major contributor to malaria transmission across the region, we aim: (a) to estimate the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for asymptomatic malaria parasite carriage in rural Amazonia; (b) to estimate the prevalence, incidence, average duration and risk factors for gametocyte carriage; (c) to compare the ability of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of gametocytes to experimentally infect wild caught local vectors; (d) to compare prospectively the risk of subsequent clinical malaria among asymptomatic parasite carriers and non-infected controls living in the same communities and to determine whether these episodes are due to persistent parasite lineages or to new infections; and (e) to test whether intra-host competition of genetically distinct parasite clones contributes to increased parasite virulence, greater risk of disease, and increased gametocyte production. These aims will be achieved with population based surveys, using uniformized clinical and laboratory protocols, in three epidemiologically diverse Amazonian settings: (a) a typical agricultural settlement with endemic malaria transmission in Brazil, (b) periurban villages in Peru that became recently exposed to epidemic malaria, and (c) gold-mining enclaves in Peru with explosive malaria outbreaks due to P. vivax. The field-based clinical and epidemiological analysis will be complemented with measurements of immunological parameters, extensive parasite genotyping and experimental infections of mosquitoes through membrane-feeding assays, providing a unique multidisciplinary perspective on the public health significance of asymptomatic parasite carriage in the Amazon Basin. Of crucial importance, the infrastructure and the data resulting of seven years of active malaria surveillance in the field sites will establish the bases for the vector biology and pathogenesis components of this proposal and for implementing future malaria vaccine trials in the Amazon region.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate, early disease diagnosis and monitoring are critical aspects to effective prevention, treatment, and remission of disease. Most diagnostic methods available today are not simple or sensitive enough to significantly impact patients' response to treatment or survival outcome. This unmet need is highlighted by diseases, such as brain cancers, that often remain asymptomatic at early stages and then grow aggressively- with fast, fatal outcomes. We have invented immunosignatures (IS) as a new approach to disease diagnoses that addresses these problems. IS is based on querying blood-serum. Using antibodies as biomarkers of disease takes advantage of a stable and easily accessible molecule and the immune system's convenient properties of diversity, surveillance, and biological amplification. The complexity of a mammalian immune system is staggering and therefore so is the information content. The reductions in cost, elimination of surgery, imaging, and the simplicity of this rapid assay pave the way to frequent, accurate monitoring of individuals in remission and those in trials with new therapies.  The innovative program presented here will build IS into a rapid, accurate diagnostic tool and demonstrate its effectiveness for brain cancer.In phase I we will validate the power of HealthTell's platform to identify peptide mimotopes (selected from a library of 330,000 random sequences) that accurately diagnose gliomas from other cancers, and classify them relative their pathological types and grades, and molecular subtypes. These will be rigorously explored and expanded in phase II to include analyses of additionally important groups: the lower grade primary gliomas and secondary brain cancers such as metastatic lung and breast cancers. Inclusion of sera from healthy volunteers in geographically matched sites relative to patients and additional blinded cohorts studies will provide data for high level performance metrics to be established. Within the term of this program, the peptide signatures will facilitate remission-stage and treatment monitoring, enabling more effective management of gliomas including better modulation of chemotherapy and radiation, and faster, more accurate evaluations of new targeted therapies. We intend to partner with the CAP/CLIA certified DNA Diagnostics Laboratory situated on the St. Joseph's Hospital Medical Center/Barrows Neurological Institute (BNI) campus for commercialization and validation relative to conventional diagnostics. Combined with the fact that BNI sees more brain tumor patients than any other place in the US, we are strongly positioned for moving this diagnostic product quickly into clinical use. Beyond this program, the peptide biomarkers identified and validated in this program will serve as early stage watch-dogs for new brain cancers on a single, universal health chip. This aligns with HealthTell's business plan of commercializing a simple, inexpensive microchip to monitor asymptomatic people for early development of disease. Continuous monitoring of healthy people would permit perturbations, such as brain cancer signatures, to be detected early.\",\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT The prevalence of food allergy is rising at an alarming rate in the United States and in other parts of thedeveloped world. Environmental stimuli that alter populations of beneficial commensal bacteria have beenimplicated in this increase. Earlier work from our laboratory showed that mice unable to signal via TLR4 exhibitenhanced allergic responses to food. We hypothesized that commensal bacteria were the source of the TLR4ligand and demonstrated that neonatal administration of a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx) inducedan allergic response in TLR4 sufficient mice equivalent to that seen in TLR4 mutant mice. In the preliminarydata presented in this revised application we have established a novel gnotobiotic model of food allergy andshow that a defined bacterial consortium, derived directly from the intestinal microbiota of healthy mice,protects against systemic hyperreactivity to a food allergen. We demonstrate that bacteria in the Clostridiaclass selectively induce a barrier protective response that includes activation of the IL-23/IL-22 axis, inductionof the expression of the anti-microbial peptides Reg3b and Reg3g and the expansion of intestinal Tregs andIgA secreting B cells; part of this response is TLR4-dependent. We hypothesize that a Clostridia-containingmicrobiota is sufficient to elicit a barrier protective response that protects against allergic responses to food. Inthe experiments proposed we will examine how allergy-protective bacterial populations deliver signals to theirhosts at both the cellular and molecular level. Seven new figures of preliminary data are provided in support ofthe two Aims outlined in this revised application. Aim 1 will determine which cellular interactions withcommensal bacteria are necessary and sufficient to induce a barrier protective response. We have used Cre-Lox technology to generate mice with targeted mutations in MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ dendritic cells (DC)and in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). We will also examine whether TLR4 signaling is required by the Tregsthemselves. Microarray analysis of intestinal epithelial cells highlighted two novel genes/pathways selectivelyupregulated in the epithelium of Clostridia colonized mice; the anti-microbial peptide Reg3b and a target genefor the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). Both pathways have been intimately linked to the regulation ofintestinal immunity. Aim 2a will examine how Ahr-mediated signals and IL22 contribute to a Clostridia inducedbarrier protective response that prevents against an allergic response to food. Finally, Aim 2b will examinehow Clostridia mediated activation of the innate and adaptive immune system impacts epithelial tight junctionprotein expression and function. The successful completion of the Aims proposed holds promise for thedevelopment of novel approaches to prevent or treat food allergy based on modulation of the composition ofintestinal microbiota.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    HIV is the most common risk factor for the emergence of active tuberculosis (TB) after previously controlled infection (latent infection). Our data suggest that tuberculous granulomas in a single host are independent and dynamic such that clinical outcome is the sum result of these interactions. Our overarching hypothesis is that each lesion bears its own risk of reactivation that is dependent on immunologic, mycobacterial and viral (HIV) interactions. We will focus on two types of asymptomatic, paucibacillary infection commonly disrupted by HIV infection, classic latent infection that occurs after recent infection (i.e., HIV induced reactivaton) and controlled infection after short course treatment for active TB (i.e., HIV driven relapse). These studies will involve the non- human primate model in which M. tuberculosis and SIV (a surrogate to HIV) infection is similar to humans. In aim 1, we will characterize the process of reactivation among CD4 depleted and SIV infected animals with latent infection. We will use bar-coded M. tuberculosis strains, in vivo imaging (PET CT) and molecular methods to detect granuloma-specific growth and killing to examine the lesional conditions that lead to reactivation compared to latent controls in the non-human primate model. We will characterize lesion specific viral load, bacterial burden and immune responses to determine what factors lead to lesional reactivation. In aim 2, we will develop a model for relapse in which asymptomatic, paucibacillary disease occurs after short course treatment for active TB. We will identify bacterial reservoirs of relapse, track bacterial relapse during SIV-Mtb co-infection and determine the lesional risk factors of relapse. In both aims 1 and 2, we will generate a road map of reactivation/relapse, identify the lesions at greatest risk and dissect the immunologic, mycobacterial and viral interactions that contribute to their risk of reactivation/relapse on a lesional level. Many of these findings, especially PET CT characterizations, are likely to be directly translatable to humans. Results of these studies will ultimately lead to better drugs strategies (targeting sites of residual bacteria at high risk of reactivation or relapse) and immun modulating modalities (either as vaccine or supplement to drug treatment).',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The abundant genetic diversity exhibited by P. falciparum, shaped by host and vector immunity, drug pressure, environmental change? is a key element to its success as a persistent pathogen. Understanding the nature, extent and distribution of genetic diversity and how it changes over time will be key to devising the most efficient and effective control measures for malaria. To date, there is no data on the population genetics of P. falciparium in the southern region of Africa. The overall goal of Research Area C is to establish regional profiles of the population genetics of P. falciparium in the ICEMR study sites. This will be accomplished using array-based and PCR-based approaches that will provide both high- and low-resolution profiles of parasite genetic diversity. In addition to population-based issues, the proven merozoite surface protein-2 (msp2) genotyping assay will be used to assess intra-individual parasite diversity with special emphasis in asymptomatic/silent infection in areas of low transmission. Aim 1) Obtain a high-resolution profile ofthe genotypic differences between parasite isolates within and between ICEMR study sites in order to establish the nature and scope of parasite genetic diversity. A high-density P. falciparum tiling array on the Affymetrix platform will be used for these studies. Aim 2) Implement and refine a PCR-based barcode approach as a simple, cost-effective tool for routinely monitoring changes in the genetic structure of parasite populations in the ICEMR study sites. The barcode will consist of -25 SNPs defined by real time RT PCR. While the barcode will provide a lower resolution genotype than the array-based approach, its lower cost and ease of use will allow a much more comprehensive profile of regional population genetic structure that will facilitate the identification of changes over time due to control measures or other factors. Aim 3) Determine the level and dynamics of parasite clonal diversity within individuals residing in low- and high-transmission areas in the ICEMR study sites. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) will be assessed based on the detection of polymorphisms in the msp2 gene by PCR. Special emphasis will be placed on asymptomatic and silent infections and the role that these individuals may have in transmission. The expectatoin is that the genotyping and MOI data will be used to create models for prediction of genetic diversity influence upon transmission dynamics, drug treatment efforts, and pathogenesis.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease is usually characterized as a movement disorder; however cognitive abilities, such as working memory and executive function, decline at early stages of the disease in most patients. The changes in brain that underlie the cognitive deficits are not well understood. We hypothesize that reduced dopamine transmission in the prefrontal cortex in Parkinson's disease is a harbinger of detrimental morphological changes in pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex whose function is necessary for normal cognition. Our data show that a partial loss of dopamine innervation to the prefrontal cortex in monkeys elicited by systemic low-dose MPTP treatment produces cognitive deficits in prefrontal cortex-dependent tasks. Other preliminary data show that there is a decrease of asymmetric (excitatory) synapses on the spines of dendrites on pyramidal neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of MPTP-treated monkeys. Together these findings suggest that the number of spine synapses on dendrites in the prefrontal cortex is dopamine-dependent and may be a morphological substrate of the cognitive deficits induced by sustained reductions in dopamine neurotransmission in this region. Modulation of spine synapses number represents a novel neuroplasticity function for dopamine. That cognitive deficits are persistent in the motor-asymptomatic MPTP-treated monkey suggests that this is a good model for the stage of Parkinson's disease in which there are few if any noticeable motor abnormalities, but significant detectable cognitive deficits. The Specific Aims of this proposal will examine this new direction, by investigating the dopamine dependency and specificity of spine synapse changes in the motor-asymptomatic primate MPTP model, examining GDNF gene transfer and pharmacological strategies for their restoration, using biochemical, electron microscopic and behavioral methods, and taking advantage of the primate facilities at the St Kitts Biomedical Research Foundation. This research will use the best animal model available to examine causes and treatments for cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, which has received scant research attention, despite its substantial impact on patients and caregivers, and ineffectiveness of available therapy.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is the 2nd most common hematologic malignancy accounting for ~1 percent of all cancers in the Western countries. Despite recent advances in treatment options, it remains incurable with high rates of relapse and drug resistance, with a median survival of ~5 years. Although the etiology of MM is unclear, it is preceded by precursor asymptomatic plasma cell dyscrasias known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM). Despite the availability of clinical risk models, genomic aberrations and imaging, efforts to utilize theseindices to accurately classify early stage precursor disease and monitor clinical course have not been successful. In contrast, recent advances in transcriptome sequencing offer new opportunities to characterize miRNAs as novel biomarkers, which could significantly change the paradigm of MM classification, and ultimately, management and treatment. The goal of the proposed investigation is to identify and characterize the contribution of miRNAs in serum exosomes on the presence of MM, and within the spectrum of progression, MGUS and SMM. We will test the overarching hypothesis that distinct serum exosome miRNAs will correlate with the presence of each precursor disease and myeloma phenotype and a subset of serum exosome miRNAs will correlate with the presence of all precursor disease and myeloma phenotypes relative to controls, giving rise to high priority targets important for MM risk. In addition, we hypothesize that miRNAs influence precursor disease and myeloma phenotypes by altering target gene expression. To address this hypothesis we intend to: (1) identify miRNAs associated with the presence of MM and its asymptomatic precursor states using discovery and independent replication populations and (2) characterize miRNA target genes important for the presence of MM and its asymptomatic precursor states using a whole transcriptome miRNA-mRNA approach. Direct modeling of miRNA-mRNA relationships is critical to advance our understanding of the role miRNAs in regulating post-transcriptional expression of target genes and in so doing, providing insight into biologic mechanism fundamental to disease etiology. This project leverages existing partnerships, resources and comprehensive, high quality clinical data and biospecimens collected in a network of populations to fill a critical gap in knowledge required to improve our understanding of myeloma etiology and disease states associated with progression. Such characterizations can be used to significantly transform the current paradigm for disease surveillance by advancing a set of biomarkers to target high-risk populations who may benefit from early detection and individualized clinical management.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia worldwide. Although new AF treatment strategies have emerged over the last decade, a major challenge facing clinicians and researchers is the paroxysmal, often short-lived, and frequently asymptomatic nature of AF. Given that paroxysmal and asymptomatic AF is a growing clinical and public health problem, better, cheaper, and more readily available AF detection technology is needed. There is, therefore, a pressing need to develop methods for readily-accessible monitoring device as well as an accurate AF detection algorithm in order to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs associated with treating these arrhythmias and their complications. To this end, we have previously developed sensitive, real-time realizable algorithm for accurate AF detection using commercially available, clinically applicable electrocardiographic recordings. We have also made improvement to the algorithm so that it can detect AF episode that is as short as 12 beats. Further, we have recently developed a smart phone application to measure heart interval series which can be used to detect AF in real time. Given the ever-growing popularity of smart phones, our approach to AF detection using a smart phone will give patients as well as health care providers the opportunity to monitor AF under a wide variety of conditions outside of the physician's office and outside of the patient's home. Because our approach does not involve a separate ECG sensor but instead uses only standard smart phone hardware, it is cost-effective, thereby leading to better acceptance and use by patients. Our mobile health for AF detection platform has the potential to markedly change the traditional delivery of AF healthcare, allowing for more frequent, rapid, and patient-directed AF detection. Our AF prototype using 2 minutes of iPhone 4s recordings has demonstrated a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 97% on 76 subjects with known persistent AF who underwent electrical at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory. Although our algorithm is robust for AF detection, a major limitation is that it is not designed to discriminate premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and premature atrial contractions (PAC) from AF. Hence, the objective of this R15 project is to enhance our real-time realizable AF algorithm for accurate detection of, and discrimination between, normal sinus rhythm, AF, PVCs, and PACs; capabilities that are not yet available. We believe this research will result in rapid translation into innovative AF detection solutions, leading to more effective monitoring and diagnosis of AF. Finally, the proposed work has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs and enhance patient care by accurately and rapidly establishing the diagnosis of AF in at-risk groups, thereby providing clinicians with an opportunity to prevent secondary complications of these life-threatening arrhythmias.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Identification of the C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat expansion as the most common cause of ALS and FTDhas generated wide interest in elucidating disease mechanisms associated with this mutation. Importantly,varied clinical manifestations and penetrance are striking characteristics of ALS associated with the C9ORF72repeat expansion (c9ALS). Diverse neuropsychological and motor features, association with 5-7% of sporadicALS, onset from the 4th to 8th decade and apparent nonpenetrance in obligate carriers suggest that thepathogenesis of c9ALS may differ among patients, and could be influenced by associated disease modifyinggenes. To elucidate the molecular basis of c9ALS and better understand its variable expression and presentationwill require correlation of clinical phenotypes with effects of the repeat expansion on disease expression andpotential concomitant molecular markers. Pathogenic significance of structural characteristics of the repeatexpansion in relation to disease penetrance, such as repeat length and the presence of short deletions in theGC-rich sequence adjacent to the repeat is not well established. A variable loss of C9ORF72 expression inrepeat carriers resulting from epigenetic changes, including trimethylation of histone H3 and H4, may also affectdisease penetrance and presentation and the relationship of these molecular markers to the onset of clinicalmotor and neuropsychological abnormalities in c9FTD/ALS remains unknown. Alterations in C9ORF72 mRNAexpression associated with aberrant histone methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells mayrepresent a disease-specific biomarker of toxic RNA expression and clinical features of c9FTD/ALS. In vivobiomarkers linking clinical manifestations of disease with underlying pathology could facilitate estimation oflifetime disease risk in mutation carriers, support earlier diagnosis, and provide a direct means to monitorresponse to therapy. However, investigation of these markers in relation to clinical phenotype, will require cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical data in c9ALS patients and asymptomatic repeat expansion carriers. As such,we hypothesize that penetrance, progression and clinical features of c9ALS may be associated withseveral molecular markers in peripheral blood, including the length of the C9ORF72 repeat expansionand its sequence context, tri-methylation of histone H3K9 and H3K27, expression C9ORF72 mRNAand/or TMEM106B genotype. In this Project, we propose to assess whether C9ORF72 repeat lengths (Aim 1),aberrant histone methylation (Aim 2) and C9ORF72 mRNA expression (Aim 3) respectively differ betweensymptomatic and asymptomatic repeat carriers, change over time in symptomatic and/or asymptomatic repeatcarriers, and associate with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical measures. Finally, we will determine whetherTMEM106B is associated with the severity of cognitive changes in c9ALS patients (Aim 4).',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, theinterdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- na¿ve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemotherapy using cytotoxic drugs is presently the most commonly used weapon in the treatment of advanced cancer. However, the therapeutic efficacy of cancer chemotherapeutic agents is limited by factors such as tumor heterogeneity, host toxicity and drug resistance. Recent advances in drug development have provided new opportunities to improve cancer therapy using drugs that target the tumor vasculature and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. To date, however, the survival benefit of these angiogenesis inhibitors has been rather modest and efforts to improve activity by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs have been only partially successful. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel, more effective approaches to combining angiogenesis inhibitors with traditional cancer chemotherapeutics, building on progress made in the last project period in studies using the VEGF receptor-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib and the liver cytochrome P450-activated anti-cancer prodrug cyclophosphamide. The major aims of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the mechanism whereby anti-angiogenic drug treatment blocks tumor regression induced by metronomic cyclophosphamide treatment and then devise alternative therapeutic approaches that circumvent this block; 2) to investigate the use of provascular strategies to enhance tumor delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs given in conjunction with anti-angiogenesis; 3) to harness the anti-vascular effects of anti-angiogenic drugs so as to increase tumor cell exposure to cytotoxic drugs administered intratumorally via an intratumoral 'trapping' (enhanced drug retention) mechanism; and 4) to investigate the impact of changes in tumor microvessel density, neovascularization and vascular maturity on responsiveness to the combination of anti-angiogenic drug treatment with chemotherapy. Together, these studies will elucidate ways to increase responsiveness to anti-angiogenic drugs by combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in a way that improves overall therapeutic activity, and will thereby advance the development of anti-cancer therapies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the management of sepsis patients, a large number of those patients die from the ensuing septic shock and multiple organ failure. Thus, there is an urgent unmet medical need for a novel and effective therapy for sepsis. Excessive recruitment of activated neutrophils into various tissues is a major contributing factor for organ injury in sepsis. In the previous cycle of this project, we have demonstrated the beneficial effect of milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) in reducing inflammatory responses and organ injury, and improving survival in an animal model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We have recently discovered a novel property of MFG-E8 in inhibiting the infiltration of activated neutrophils into tissues. By analyzing the proten structure of human MFG-E8 for its binding to integrins, we have screened a large number of human MFG-E8-derived peptides. We have identified a short peptide, named MSP68, which inhibited neutrophil adhesion and migration. In this renewal application, we will focus on further characterization of MSP68 in alleviating tissue injury in sepsis and the development of MSP68 as a new anti-sepsis therapy. Post-treatment with MSP68 significantly decreased the inflammatory responses and attenuated organ damage in sepsis mice induced by CLP. MSP68 treatment reduced the number of neutrophils infiltrating into the lungs and liver of sepsis mice. The ten-day survival of sepsis mice was markedly improved with MSP68 treatment. MSP68 had a direct effect on regulating neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we further demonstrated that MSP68 bound to integrins directly. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that the human MFG-E8-derived peptide MSP68 inhibits neutrophil infiltration into tissues during sepsis, leading to the attenuation of tissue ijury and improvement in survival of sepsis animals. Accordingly, three specific aims are proposed: (1) to further investigate the role of MSP68 in inhibiting neutrophil infiltration in sepsis; (2) t determine the molecular mechanism responsible for such an inhibitory effect of MSP68; and (3) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSP68 as a therapeutic agent for sepsis. The proposed studies will lead to a new direction for the development of innovative therapeutics for patients with sepsis. Through this innovative research, it is expected that MSP68 will be developed as a novel drug to treat sepsis and septic shock.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary The structural & dynamic basis for the interdependence of drug resistance Project 1 - Schiffer, UMASS Medical School In many drug resistance variants variants, multiple site mutations co-evolve to both decrease the affinity of a particular inhibitor and increase the viability and fitness of the enzyme. We hypothesize that the impact of particular mutations on conferring drug resistance is not simply additive, but that these mutations have a complex interdependent effect leading to viable variants that are highly resistant to existing drugs. As a project team we will test this hypothesis through a systematic and quantitative evaluation of the interdependency in drug resistance at the molecular level in HIV protease, through changes in the protease structure, thermodynamics, enzyme kinetics and dynamics by state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques and apply this knowledge to develop inhibitors with high barrier to resistance. This data will identify residues and combinations of mutations that are pivotal signature sites in conferring drug resistance. Such a strategy is critical to revealing the complex molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, and both avoid resistance from the start and target highly resistant variants seen in clinic. This strategy will be directly applicable to other quickly evolving diseases where drug resistance thwarts effective therapy.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One challenge to understanding and preventing malaria is that people who are infected with Plasmodium parasites, and potentially infectious to mosquito vectors, are frequently asymptomatic, hence not recognized as contributing to transmission dynamics. This research project will determine which people are infected with Plasmodium gametocytes, evaluate resulting mosquito infections that derive from those infectious people, and infer population-level patterns of malaria risk that emerge from these transmission events. We will take advantage of ongoing NIH-funded research (International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research) in southern Malawi where different intensities of transmission occur. Using a new molecular-genetic detection technique (qRT-PCR) for recognizing low-density P. falciparum gametocytes that are not normally seen through microscopy, we will explore associations between infection and symptoms, treatment, age and various environmental/behavioral risk factors. Specifically, we will test three hypotheses addressing 1) the prevalence of parasitemia, and specifically gametocytemia, in relation to transmission intensity and treatment, 2) patterns of gametocytemia with regard to age, mosquito ecology, and anti-malarial interventions, and 3) impacts on household-level transmission to Anopheles vectors. This project is innovative in using a new molecular diagnostic method to evaluate naturally-infected, asymptomatic people combined with non-experimental field transmission to mosquitoes found in common living contexts of the region. We expect our results to have household- and community-level transmission implications for treatment and prevention that may affect the seasonality and annual re-intensification of transmission in ways that are dynamically counterintuitive.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the success of highly active anti-retroviral therapy in controlling virus replication in HIV-1 positive individuals, problems such as drug resistance and side effects often compromise the effectiveness of anti-HIV- 1 drug. Therefore, new anti-HIV agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed. In an effort to identify novel anti-HIV-1 agents, we have developed potent betulinic acid (BA) derivatives that inhibit HIV-1 maturation. These compounds are structurally and mechanistically novel when compared to the drugs currently used for AIDS therapy. Their potentials for treatment of AIDS are currently being evaluated under different stages of preclinical or clinical studies. Bevirimat is at the most advanced stage of drug development among the anti- HIV-1 BA derivatives. Although bevirimat is a potent HIV-1 maturation inhibitor, results of phase II clinical trials indicate that it is less effective in a subset (30-40%) of HIV-1 positive individuals. Therefore, bevirimat analogs that can overcome this high baseline drug resistance are expected to have great potential to be developed into anti-HIV-1 drugs. The objective of this study is to synthesize bevirimat analogs that overcome the high baseline drug resistance. We have previously identified the C3 side chain as the anti-HIV-1 maturation pharmacophore of bevirimat. We hypothesize that suitable modifications of the pharmacophore will create a new class of bevirimat analogs that are effective against the drug resistant viruses. We plan to test this hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this study with the following Specific Aims: (1) to synthesize BA derivatives with optimized pharmacophores. (2) To identify new terpenoid scaffolds and auxiliary groups for the synthesis of new anti-maturation inhibitors against the drug resistant viruses. (3) To determine the drug binding site and mechanism of action of the anti-HIV-1 maturation BA derivatives. Aside from the high baseline drug resistance to bevirimat, results from clinical trials have been promising. The proposed study is expected to overcome this drug resistance and, as a result, will have a high impact on developing a class of novel anti-HIV-1 maturation inhibitors for AIDS therapy.',\n",

There are currently no effective FTLD therapies, although new drugs are reaching the stage where clinical trials are warranted. The overarching goal of this proposal is to build a FTLD clinical research consortium (FTLD CRC) to support the development of FTLD therapies. The FTLD CRC will be headquartered at UCSF and will partner with six patient advocacy groups to manage the consortium. Patients will be evaluated at 13 clinical sites throughout North America, and a genetics core will genotype all individuals for FTLD associated genes. Clinical research projects will focus on specific FTLD syndromes where there is a strong correlation between clinical syndrome and underlying pathology, who are targeted for enrollment in new trials. Research Project 1 will collect cross-sectional data in sporadic FTLD patients using a new FTLD assessment battery, as well as screening all individuals for known FTLD-causing mutations and evidence of systemic inflammation, to prepare for trials of anti-tau and anti-inflammatory agents. Research Project 2 will collect longitudinal clinical and MRl data on familial FTLD (f-FTLD) individuals who carry mutations in MAPT, GRN and C90RF72 and their asymptomatic family members to enable disease prevention clinical trials. Our specific aims are to: 1) build a FTLD clinical trials network to facilitate the design and conduct of clinical trials; 2) determine the clinical, genetic and systemic inflammatory cytokine profile of sporadic FTLD targeted for new trials: semantic variant PPA, FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and PSPS; 3) determine the natural history of asymptomatic and symptomatic f-FTLD patients using novel clinical measures and MR imaging over one year; 4) obtain pilot data using the new tau PET imaging agent PBB3 in FTLD, and other novel FTLD biomarkers and clinical tools that may be employed in future trials; 5) train clinical researchers focused on FTLD therapeutic development.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by cellular resistance to apoptosis leading to prolonged survival and accumulation of tumor cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Standardized incidence rates of MM are increasing and are typically two-fold higher among African Americans and men. Although the etiology of MM is unclear, it is preceded by precursor asymptomatic plasma cell dyscrasias known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM). Despite the availability of clinical risk models, genomic aberrations and imaging, efforts to utilize these indices to accurately classify early stage precursor disease and monitor clinical course have not been successful. Alternatively, recent advances in transcriptome sequencing offer new opportunities to characterize miRNAs as novel biomarkers, which could significantly change the paradigm of MM classification, management and treatment. The goal of the proposed Exploratory/Developmental investigation is to characterize the role of heparanase (HPSE), a potent tumor regulator, and exosome mircroRNAs (miRNA) as biomarkers for early detection, classification and progression of individuals at highest risk for developing MM from asymptomatic precursor states. We will test the overarching hypothesis that serum exosome HPSE and miRNA profiles correlate with myeloma progression. To address this hypothesis we intend to: (1) characterize HPSE protein levels in exosomes isolated from the sera of patients with MGUS, SMM and MM and sex-, age-, ancestry-matched controls; (2) conduct miRNA profiling in serum exosomes; and (3) determine the extent to which HPSE influences exosome miRNA composition relative to myeloma progression. We intend to capitalize on a unique opportunity to explore these relationships in a large, well-characterized population of myeloma, while taking advantage of recent advances in HPSE and exosome biology and genome sequencing. We anticipate that findings from this investigation will be highly informative and provide the foundation necessary to propose biologic mechanisms underlying myelomagenesis as well as new biomarkers for disease. These novel biomarkers could significantly change the paradigm for myeloma diagnosis, classification, management and treatment and improve overall survival by reducing morbidity and mortality associated with advanced stage disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Signal transduction pathways rely on reversible chemical modifications to relay information within and across cells. Covalent modification of protein substrates by ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) contribute to pathways that regulate cellular functions including nuclear transport, cytokinesis, chromosome segregation, G2-M cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation among many others. Post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins requires the sequential action of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes and E3 ligases while Ub/Ubl processing and deconjugation is catalyzed by Ub/Ubl-specific proteases. Ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation play an integral role in eukaryotic nuclear metabolism and cell cycle control and our studies are of direct relevance to human health, cancer, and the mission of the NIH. This proposal seeks to address the functional significance for components of the ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation pathways through structural, biochemical and genetic studies that will establish the basis for Ub/Ubl 1) activation, 2) conjugation by E2 and E3 enzymes, 3) signal transduction through characterization receptors that recognize Ub/Ubl-conjugated substrates. The enzymes, mechanisms and factors that constitute ubiquitin and SUMO protein conjugation pathways are conserved so our studies will be broadly relevant and will impact research in other Ub/Ubl-related pathways.',\n",

       " 'Many species of insects have adverse effects on human society by acting as agricultural pests or vectors of human and animal diseases. Chemical pesticides remain the most common approach to managing insect pests and vectors. However, pesticides are an indiscriminate tool. In addition to their direct negative effects on human health, pesticides can harm beneficial insects such as crop pollinators and predators of insect and other arthropod pests. Genetic modification of insect pests and disease vectors presents an attractive alternative because its effects are inherently limited to the target species. Exogenous genes ( transgenes ) stably integrated into the genome cannot cross species barriers, and many approaches exist for preventing their damaging effects from spreading up the food chains. For example, conditional and sex-specific sterility caused by transgenic modification can decimate the populations of target species without affecting any other species or introducing toxic chemicals into the ecosystem. Recent advances in Drosophila and other animal models are opening the way for precise and targeted genome engineering using custom RNA-guided nucleases. The goal of this project is to enable this approach in a broad range of insect species by developing precise gene replacement techniques based on CRISPR/Cas nucleases. We will first examine and optimize this system in the model species D. melanogaster, where these experiments can be performed most easily. We will then apply the lessons learned from D. melanogaster to implement this approach in non-model species, including two species that have recently become invasive agricultural pests in the USA and Europe. This approach can be applied to any non-model insect that is amenable to germline delivery of RNA.',\n",

       " 'While it is clear that HIV-1 assembly occurs predominantly on the plasma membrane (PM), the itinerary that the Gag precursor follows to reach its destination remains ill defined. Likewise, the host cell machinery that promotes Gag trafficking to the PM is incompletely understood. We and others have demonstrated that the matrix (MA) domain of Gag regulates targeting to the site of virus assembly, and we discovered that the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 and the ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) serve important functions in directing Pr55Gag to the PM. We are actively engaged in studies to elucidate further the cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 Gag trafficking. This effort combines virology, biochemistry, cell biology, and imaging techniques and is also being extended to the nonprimate lentiviruses equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Proteins of particular interest in this area include the Arf proteins, SNAREs, F-BAR domain proteins, clathrin, and FLJ90680. In studies related to Gag trafficking, we are also investigating the host cell machinery required for Gag localization to, and virus transfer across, the virological synapse. The viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins are incorporated into virions during the assembly process. We have shown that point mutations in the MA domain of Gag block Env incorporation, and demonstrated that the long gp41 cytoplasmic tail plays a cell-type-dependent role in Env incorporation. Despite the evidence for a direct interaction between MA and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail, the molecular mechanism by which Env is incorporated and the basis for cell type dependence of cytoplasmic tail function remain to be defined. We will address the hypothesis that host cell factors are likely to play an important role in Env incorporation into virions. We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay for Gag-Env interaction that will be useful in evaluating this hypothesis. We have also demonstrated that MA trimerization plays a critical role in Env incorporation and have identified residues that are required for MA trimer formation.

       " 'Obesity is a huge and increasing medical problem, with inadequate therapeutic options.  One approach to the treatment of obesity is long-term pharmacotherapy.  While only one modestly effective drug marketed in the United States (orlistat), two drugs have recently been approved by the FDA (lorcaserin, Qsymia).  The limited efficacy of single agents has lead to the idea that additional agents and combination therapy are required.  Progress in FY2014 includes the following:  We published a re-examination of chemical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) as a treatment for obesity in mice.  DNP was an effective and widely used weight loss drug in the early 1930s.  However, the physiology of DNP has not been studied in detail because toxicity, including hyperthermia and death, reduced interest in the clinical use of chemical uncouplers. To investigate DNP action, mice fed a high fat diet and housed at 30 C (to minimize facultative thermogenesis) were treated with DNP in drinking water. DNP treatment increased energy expenditure but did not change food intake.  DNP-treated mice weighed 26% less than controls after 2 months of treatment due to decreased fat mass, without a change in lean mass. DNP improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic steatosis without observed toxicity. DNP treatment also reduced brown adipose tissue activity, demonstrating that DNP-mediated heat generation substituted for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.  At 22 C, a typical vivarium temperature that is below thermoneutrality, DNP treatment had no effect on body weight, adiposity, or glucose homeostasis. Thus, environmental temperature should be considered when assessing an anti-obesity drug in mice, particularly agents acting on energy expenditure. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of DNP suggest that chemical uncouplers deserve further investigation for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities.  We published a study that MTII, a widely used melanocortin agonist that increases metabolic rate, can also cause a transient hypometabolism and hypothermia.  We propose that the hypometabolism/hypothermia is a regulated response, potentially beneficial during extreme physiologic stress.  We published the effects of intermittent cold exposure (4 C for one to eight hours three times a week) on C57BL/6J mice fed a high fat diet. Despite the unchanged adiposity, the cold-treated mice showed transient improvements in glucose homeostasis. Administration of the cannabinoid receptor-1 inverse agonist AM251 caused weight loss and improvements in glucose homeostasis, but showed no further improvements when combined with cold exposure. These data suggest that intermittent cold exposure causes transient, meaningful improvements in glucose homeostasis, but without synergy when combined with AM251.',\n",
       " 'The objectives of this project, and related progress in the past year (2013-2014), are reviewed below.(1) DEVELOPMENT OF A REVERSE GENETICS SYSTEM THAT CAN BE USED TO MODIFY RV ANTIGENICITY AND VIRULENCE.Recently, we developed an RV single-segment reverse genetics system that allows replacement of the segment 8 (s8) RNA of the temperature-sensitive mutant virus, tsE, with a recombinant s8 RNA that encodes a fully functional NSP2. Using this system, we were able to engineer recombinant (r)RVs with s8 RNAs that were longer than wildtype, due to the introduction of sequence duplications and heterologous sequences. Subsequently, we have pursued two lines of experiments designed to generate rRVs with s8 RNAs that express foreign protein. (1) T7 transcription vectors for s8 were constructed in which a translational 2A skip element linked to a Gaussia luciferase ORF was inserted into the NSP2 ORF. Reverse genetics experiments to recover rRVs with the modified s8 RNA were attempted using a cell line (MA104-NSP2R) that expresses wildtype NSP2 and an shRNA targeting the tsE s8 RNA. (2) T7 transcription vectors for s8 were constructed in which a ribosomal-readthrough element derived from Colorado Tick Fever Virus (CTFV) segment 9 linked to a HA-ubiquitin ORF was inserted immediately downstream of an intact NSP2 ORF. Reverse genetics experiments to recover rRVs with the modified s8 RNA were attempted using a cell line expressing an shRNA that targeted the tsE s8 RNA. Analysis of virus in cell lysates obtained from reverse genetics experiments suggest that rRVs with the engineered s8 RNAs may be present, but at levels too low to be recoverable. Currently, we are modifying reverse genetics procedures to improve the efficiency of rRV formation and recovery. Generation of rRVs that express foreign proteins may be useful for engineering next generation RV vaccines that provide protection not only against RV disease, but also against diseases caused by other enteric pathogens.(2) ELUCIDATION OF RV MECHANISMS THAT SUBVERT HOST ANTIVIRAL PATHWAYS. The segmented RV genome allows the generation of new virus strains through reassortment. However, the vast majority of human RVs have either of two genotype constellations: G1/3/4/9/12-P8-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 (genogroup 1) or G2-P4-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 (genogroup 2). Thus, human RVs appear to be under strong selective pressures that favor the maintenance of certain genotype constellations, despite their opportunity to reassort with large numbers of co-circulating genetically-distinct human and animal RVs. The nature of the barriers that select against the emergence of reassortant strains is not understood, but may reflect the co-evolution of RV RNAs and/or proteins that function optimally when maintained as sets. In addition, adaptation of RVs to select hosts may have given rise to viral proteins that are species specific in their function. These latter proteins likely include the RV nonstructural protein, NSP1, which we have shown is an antagonist of host innate immune responses. NSP1 is a putative viral E3 ubiquitin ligase containing a conserved N-terminal RING domain and a highly variable C-terminal targeting domain. By phylogenetic analysis, we determined that the 18 NSP1 genotypes described to date can be resolved into 3 groups: OSU-like, UK-like, and SA11-4F-like. The OSU-like NSP1 group includes only the A1, A2, and A8 genotypes, and thus nearly all human RVs and select porcine RVs belong to this group. OSU-like NSP1 proteins are characterized by the ability to prevent the function of beta-TrCP, a cellular protein critical to NFkB activation and to the induction of host antiviral responses. As we discovered, a hallmark feature of OSU-like NSP1 proteins is the presence of a phosphodegron-like motif (DSGxS) in the C-terminal targeting domain; this motif mediates the interaction of NSP1 with beta-TrCP. RVs with UK-like and SA11-4F-like NSP1 proteins are almost exclusively animal strains; their NSP1 proteins target interferon regulatory factors (IRF3, IRF5, and/or IRF7), instead of beta-TrCP, and lack phosphodegron-like motifs. These findings indicate that the NSP1 proteins of human/porcine RVs (OSU-like) are functionally distinct from the NSP1 proteins of most animal RVs (UK and SA11-4F-like). Hence, the emergence of human reassortant RVs expressing animal NSP1 proteins as significant causes of human disease seems improbable, given that such reassortants would lack NSP1 activities normally associated with human RVs and that likely influence virulence and viral pathogenesis. (3) ANALYSIS OF THE DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION OF THE RV GENOME.(a) RVs with G10P11 genotype specificity have been associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic neonatal infections in Vellore, India. To identify possible viral genetic determinants that affect RV pathogenesis, the genome sequences of G10P11 RVs in stool samples of 19 neonates with symptomatic infections and 20 neonates with asymptomatic infections were determined by Sanger and next-generation sequencing. The data showed that all 39 viruses had identical genotype constellations (G10-P11-I2-R2-C2-M2-A1-N1-T1-E2-H3), the same as the previously characterized symptomatic Vellore isolate N155. The data also showed that the RNA and deduced protein sequences of all the Vellore G10P11 viruses were nearly identical; no nucleotide or amino acid differences were found that correlated with symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection. Next-generation sequencing data revealed that some stool samples, both from neonates with symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, also contained one or more positive-strand RNA viruses (Aichi virus, astrovirus, or salivirus/klassevirus) suspected of being potential causes of pediatric gastroenteritis. However, none of the positive-strand RNA viruses could be causally associated with the development of symptoms. These results indicate that the diversity of clinical symptoms in Vellore neonates does not result from genetic differences among G10P11 RVs; instead, other undefined factors appear to influence whether neonates develop gastrointestinal disease symptoms.(b) Genome reassortment allows RV to acquire advantageous genes and adapt in the face of selective pressures. Yet, reassortment may also impose fitness costs if it unlinks genes/proteins that have accumulated compensatory, co-adaptive mutations and operate best when kept together. To better understand human RV evolutionary dynamics, we analyzed the genome sequences of 135 strains (genotype G1/G3/G4-P8-I1-C1-R1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1) that were collected at a single location in Washington, DC, during the years of 1974-1991. Intra-genotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed for each viral gene using the nucleotide sequences, thereby defining novel allele-level gene constellations (GCs) and illuminating putative reassortment events. The results showed that RVs with distinct GCs co-circulated during the vast majority of the collection years, and that some of these GCs persisted in the community, unchanged by reassortment. To investigate the influence of protein co-adaptation on GC maintenance, we performed a mutual information-based analysis of the concatenated amino acid sequences and identified an extensive co-variance network. Unexpectedly, amino acid co-variation was highest between VP4 and VP2, which are structural components of the RV virion that are not thought to directly interact. These results suggest that GCs may be influenced by the selective constraints placed on functionally co-adapted, albeit non-interacting, viral proteins. This work raises important questions about the mutation-reassortment interplay and its impact on human RV evolution.',\n",
       " 'In 1927, Norris described individuals with low blood pressure (BP) as persons who lacked stamina, tiredeasily, complained of cold extremities and showed an inability to do prolonged mental or physical work; hewas quoted as saying;  they are not exactly ill; yet they are rarely well.  1 However, several more recentpapers have challenged the notion that low BP is a health concern, and even suggest that hypotension isthe ideal  normal  BP.2, 3 Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) above T5 are reported to struggle withchronic hypotension,4-11 episodic orthostatic hypotension (OH) 12-16 and post-prandial hypotension.17 Infact, we recently reported that, over the course of a typical 24-hour day, the incidence of hypotension wasas high as 70% in those with cervical lesions.18 In addition our unpublished data suggest that theincidence of hypotension is 2.5 fold increased in veterans with SCI compared to age-matched veteranswithout SCI. However, chronic hypotension is often not clinically addressed because the vast majority ofhypotensive individuals remain asymptomatic. That said there evidence in the general medical literaturesupporting associations between asymptomatic hypotension, cognitive deficits, adverse changes in moodand quality of life (QOL). Compared to normotensive age-matched controls, otherwise healthy subjectswith chronic asymptomatic hypotension are reported to have slowed cognitive speed, 19 fewer word recall,20 decreased accuracy of response,21 limited attention,20 prolonged reaction times,19, 21, 22 and reducedmemory and concentration capacity. 21, 22 In addition, several papers have reported findings suggestingsignificant associations between chronic hypotension and increased incidence of depression,23-30anxiety,25, 26 unexplained tiredness,24, 31 and poor perception of well being.32 Although many hypotensiveindividuals with chronic SCI remain asymptomatic and do not raise clinical suspicion warrantingintervention, we believe, and have demonstrated that asymptomatic chronic hypotension has adversecognitive consequences.33-35 It must be appreciated that the superimposition of cognitive impairment onthe physical, social and emotional limitations already experienced by many individuals with SCI mayseverely impact autonomy and social independence thereby diminishing QOL.36, 37 There is compellingevidence in the general medical literature suggesting that elevation in systemic BP, following midodrinehydrochloride administration, increases resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and improves CBF responses tocognitive testing resulting in better test performance in healthy individuals with chronic hypotension. 38, 39Because it is believed that the etiology of hypotension in the SCI population is the result of adrenergicinsufficiency, midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, is considered a first line treatment, 40-42 and we havedemonstrated significant increases in systemic BP in hypotensive individuals with SCI.43, 44 However, ingeneral, data describing the BP effect of midodrine have been collected in small samples of hypotensivesubjects with SCI during laboratory observations,44, 45 the benefit of sustained elevation in systemic BP onCBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL has not been rigorously studied in the SCI population. Datagenerated in this pilot project will be used to power a large-scale clinical trial to determine theclinical benefit of sustained increases in BP on CBF, cognitive function, mood and QOL in personswith SCI.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Working Group for Civilian Biodefense reviewed potential biological threat agents and listed those considered to pose the greatest threat to the civilian population. Variola and other orthopox DNA viruses were identified as a potential bioterrorism threat. Additionally, other DNA viruses are of increasing concern in a public health context due to the emergence of new pathogens and the potential for development of drug resistance among currently recognized viruses. Thus, the development of new, more effective broad-spectrum antiviral compounds against category A-C and emerging pathogens is a high priority for NIAID. The DNA viruses, which include herpes-, adeno-, pox-, polyoma- and papillomaviruses, have a requirement for DNA synthesis during their life cycle. This common element therefore becomes a common target for broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. The nucleoside phosphonates (NP), exemplified by HPMPA and cidofovir, have shown strong activity across a wide spectrum of DNA viruses. However, their development as antiviral drugs has been hampered by their inherent lack of bioavailability due to their highly polar nature. Our research efforts have centered on overcoming the lack of oral bioavailability and low cellular permeability of available broad-spectrum antiviral cyclic and acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (CNP and ANP) drugs by means of a novel prodrug strategy. In the Phase I portion of the project, these efforts have yielded a lead series of prodrugs of HPMPC (cidofovir) and HPMPA with greatly enhanced in vitro antiviral potency against several DNA viruses, good oral absorption and significantly reduced risk of toxicity. In this Phase II SBIR project, we propose toscreen the lead compounds by fully characterizing their PK properties, testing their in vivo efficacy in a number of acceptable animal models and measuring their toxicity in order to select a lead compound to take forward into the clinic. The proposed program is based upon an established drug research partnership between Dr. John Hilfinger at TSRL, Inc. and Professor Charles McKenna at the University of Southern California and will draw upon essential and unique virological expertise from collaborators located at the University of Alabama Birmingham, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, St. Louis University, Utah State University, and SUNY Medical Center.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that is activated following Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Genetic variants in IRF5 hav been robustly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility in both genome-wide and candidate gene association studies. While IRF5 is strongly and consistently associated with SLE, the mechanisms by which IRF5 predisposes to human SLE are still unclear. Our central hypothesis is that SLE-associated variants in IRF5 promote autoantibody formation and alter transcriptional patterns in human immune cells following TLR ligation, resulting in risk of SLE. We have previously shown that SLE-risk haplotypes of IRF5 are associated with autoantibody formation in both SLE patients and healthy autoantibody positive individuals. The HLA locus is strongly associated with SLE, and the MHC molecules encoded by this locus can direct the immune response against particular self-antigens. We propose that SLE-associated variants in MHC molecules present self-peptides derived from particular nuclear antigens, and then IRF5 variants cooperate in autoantibody production by enhancing activation of self-reactive B-cells directed against these antigens. In our preliminary data, we support this concept with evidence for a strong gene-gene interaction between IRF5 and HLA upon autoantibody formation in SLE patients (OR=3.42). IRF5 is a transcription factor, and it seems likely that risk variants should influence SLE risk by altering transcriptional profiles in immune cells. In preliminary data, we show that IRF5 risk variants result in differential binding to ISRE promoter elements in human cell lines. IRF5 translocation to the nucleus was greatly augmented in SLE patient monocytes, while little increased translocation was observed in NK and T cell lineages. These data support an important role for IRF5 variations in human monocytes. We have two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define gene-gene interactions between HLA haplotypes and IRF5 genetic variants upon autoantibody traits in human populations. We will genotype 1500 SLE patients at the IRF5 and HLA loci to examine IRF5-HLA gene-gene interactions upon autoantibody traits. Additionally, we will study a unique cohort of individuals with SLE-associated autoantibodies who have a range of diagnoses, including asymptomatic people who are at risk of progression to SLE. Aim 2: Determine changes in transcriptional targeting of the IRF5 SLE-risk variants in monocytes and B cells from SLE patients, autoantibody positive asymptomatic subjects, and healthy controls. We will purify cells from the two lineages noted above from subjects homozygous for risk or protective haplotypes of IRF5. Cells will be stimulated with TLR7 or TLR9 ligands. ChIP-seq will be performed, and peaks will be compared between genotype categories and between patient groups. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of human SLE, so that diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be informed by the molecular biology of disease in a given individual. We will make progress toward this goal via the following expected outcomes: 1. Identify robust IRF5-HLA interactions that contribute to the break in tolerance to nuclear antigens observed in autoimmune disease and 2. Define transcriptional targets of IRF5 that are characteristic of the SLE-risk haplotypes and determine how these transcriptional patterns are associated with varying degrees and stages of autoimmunity in human populations (healthy, asymptomatic seropositive, and SLE).',\n",
       " \"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACTAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiplegenetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset forAD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individualswith 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetimeAD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many ofthe apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stayasymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the lattergroup to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk.Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerativedisorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN)gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRNmutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how thesame mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial forunraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments.Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derivedfrom AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in humanneurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well-characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to studydisease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this projectare to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to ADpathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How doheterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e.,FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., A¿production/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSClines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine thetranscriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOADpatients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlyingmechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations causeNCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeuticdevelopment by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels.\",\n",
       " \"instructions): Our Overall theme and objective of this Center is to develop new classes ofhost-targeting antiviral therapeutics that are capable of treating multiple NIAID Emerging and Re-emergingPriority Pathogen viruses, when used alone or in combination with other available agents. The range ofplanned activities spans the translational development spectrum: from generating new host target focusedleads, to validating promising lead molecules, and advancing optimized leads. We hypothesize that acollection of exciting preliminary datasets now offer the potential to be collaboratively translated into thedevelopment of novel broad spectrum antivirals. More specifically, we will test the following hypotheses: 1)human haploid genetic screens can identify novel host genes required for multiple RNA viruses, andrecombinant AAV viral vectors can both validate these targets and serve as development candidates againstthe identified genes; 2) a suite of novel computational methods can identify compounds with affinity fordominant drug targets and thereby yield new antiviral therapies based on poisoning essential oligomeric viralor viral-host protein complexes; 3) recent insights into the mechanistic basis of how interferons engage theirreceptors and transduce their antiviral gene expression program can be leveraged into the development ofinterferons with novel antiviral properties, and that a unique small molecule inhibitor of PDE12 2' phosphodiesterase(A-74528) can prolong the antiviral programs generated by both these novel and currentlyapproved interferons (IFNs); 4) the apparent widespread dependence of RNA viruses on specific intracellularpools of phosphoinositides such as PI4P and PI4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) can be translated into an effectivehost cell based antiviral therapy via the development of appropriate small molecule inhibitors of specific PI4-and PIPS- kinases ; 5) the development of novel countermeasures against RNA viruses can be acceleratedthrough repurposing of existing approved drugs, and that the same type of meta-analysis of high throughput(HT) molecular measurements that has uncovered new opportunities for treating transplant rejection andfatty liver can be applied to infectious diseases and thereby yield a pipeline for identifying novel host targetsupon which viruses depend and that can be inhibited with approved drugs; 6) the therapeutics contemplatedabove can be used in combination to achieve still more potent, broad-spectrum antiviral therapies with highbarriers to resistance.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In South Africa, HIV-infected children in poorer families are often responsible for the parental care of younger (often uninfected) siblings and so any disease events they experience have far-reaching consequences. As in adults, atherosclerosis due to HIV-related chronic inflammation despite adequate viral suppression is a growing concern for children on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Effective lifestyle, diet and therapeutic interventions are available but efficacy is limited unless instituted early in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Diagnosis of asymptomatic increased atherosclerosis risk requires effective nationwide surveillance at primary health clinic level. This longitudinal cohortcontrol study intends to quantify excess atherosclerosis risk in HIV-infected children on ART and to generate and validate a low tech screening algorithm to identify affected asymptomatic individuals using simple input variables that can be routinely collected during primary healthcare follow-up. AIM 1 will investigate the magnitude and longitudinal evolution of atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) risk in virally-suppressed perinatally-infected children on ART. Aorto-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial elasticity, predicts incident cardiovascular events in asymptomatic adults and is a reliable gold- standard marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. We will compare longitudinal change in PWV Z-score over 5 years in children with and without HIV. PWV in this Primary Cohort will be adjusted for systolic blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose, BMI, diet and tobacco smoke exposure. AIM 2 will generate a low tech, low cost, scalable diagnostic screening algorithm to detect asymptomatic increased AVD risk (defined as abnormally raised PWV) in a resource limited setting. We will compare various candidate screening tests that are predictive of incident cardiovascular events in adults, with PWV as a gold standard. Measures collected in the Primary Cohort will be used to develop the algorithm. Measures will be repeated in a Validation Cohort of 75 additional pre-pubertal HIV-infected children receiving the national first- line ART regimen in a programmatic setting, who will be recruited in year 3 and followed longitudinally until year 5 to validate the sensitivit and specificity of the algorithm. AIM 3 will investigate whether the circulating biomarkers most strongly predictive of vascular disease in adults correlate with abnormal PWV in virally-suppressed children and are useful for identifying increased AVD risk. Expected outcomes: A simple surveillance tool will enable nurse-driven, low-cost, high-efficacy country-wide surveillance for increased AVD risk in HIV-infected children on ART using widely-available equipment and easily-obtainable skills, facilitating therapeutic intervention early in pathogenesis Ultimately, early intervention will substantially reduce overall AVD burden in adulthood in this high-risk population, preserving their ability to care for the needs of family members and younger siblings.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) entry is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Binding of the gp120 domain of Env to CD4 leads to conformational changes that expose the coreceptor binding site. Interaction with the coreceptor activates the gp41 domain of Env to promote fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. HIV-1 Env remains an attractive target for vaccines and antiviral therapies as it is the only viral protein exposed on the surface of HIV-1 virions. Based on the metastable nature of the unliganded HIV-1 Env trimer, antiviral strategies have followed three main concepts: 1) competitive inhibition without allosteric activation; 2) premature allosteric activation in the absence of target cell membranes; and 3) diversion into off- pathway conformations. This application proposes to test the hypothesis that the stabilization of the ground state conformation of Env, which prevents the activation of Env, is an underutilized antiviral strategy. Support for this hypothesis is based on the impact on Env conformation of antibodies that neutralize up to 98% of all HIV-1 isolates. To test this hypothesis, we have established single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging methods to directly visualize the conformational dynamics of single Env molecules within the native trimer on the surface of intact virions. Fluorophores introduced into variable regions V1, V4, and V5 of gp120 of the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 allowed the time-resolved monitoring of structural dynamics of individual gp120 domains within the context of the native Env trimer on the surface of intact virions. These data reveal that the unliganded HIV-1 Env is dynamic and intrinsically accesses the receptor- and coreceptor- stabilized conformations. The establishment of smFRET for HIV-1 Env allows insights into the inner workings of this molecular machine and how it is activated for fusion by the two-step receptor and coreceptor mechanism. Moreover, it offers a fast and reliable assay for the conformational state of HIV-1 Env on the surface of virions. Using this approach we have shown that the broadly neutralizing antibodies, VRC01, PG16, PGT128, PGT145, and 2G12, stabilize HIV-1 Env in its ground-state conformation despite engaging Env in fundamentally different ways. VRC01 recognizes an epitope in the CD4-binding site; PG16, PGT128, and PGT145 bind V1/V2 at the apex of the trimer; and 2G12 recognizes conserved glycans at the base of the V3 loop. These results suggest that stabilization of the ground state but not of an activated intermediate or off- pathway conformation represents a powerful antiviral strategy. Notably, the above experiments were performed with the neutralization-sensitive NL4-3 HIV-1 isolate. Here, we will test whether broadly neutralizing antibodies similarly function on Env from clinical HIV-1 isolates. We will also test the conformational consequences of entry inhibitors, such as BMS-626529 that may similarly stabilize the ground state. In so doing, the proposed studies have the potential to establish that ground state stabilization is an effective way to antagonize viral membrane fusion machines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor Nrf2 has emerged as a master regulator of a cellular protective mechanism by upregulating antioxidant response element (ARE)-bearing genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, detoxifying enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, and stress response proteins. Keap1, a substrate adaptor protein for a Cullin3 (Cul3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, tightly regulates the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is constantly targeted for Keap1-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation to maintain a low constitutive level in al human organs. Upon activation of the pathway, the enzymatic activity of the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase is inhibited, resulting in stabilization of Nrf2 and activation of Nrf2 downstream genes. Since the discovery of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway in 1999, Nrf2 has been viewed as a  good  transcription factor that protects us from oxidative stress-related diseases, including cancer. The chemopreventive property of Nrf2 has been well documented by the following two facts: (i) many of the well- studied chemopreventive compounds elicit their activities through activation of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway, and (ii) Nrf2-null mice are highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and are no longer protected by chemopreventive compounds. Paradoxically, the  dark side  of Nrf2 has recently been revealed. For instance, somatic mutations that disrupt the Keap1-mediated negative regulation of Nrf2, resulting in a high constitutive level of Nrf2, have been identified in several types of tumors and cancer cel lines, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Furthermore, mounting evidence has emerged, indicating that Nrf2 contributes to chemoresistance, the major obstacle in cancer treatment. The discovery of the  dark side  of Nrf2 has clearly illustrated the urgent need to identify Nrf2 inhibitors and develop them into druggable compounds to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments. We have screened a large number of natural products for their inhibition of ARE-luciferase activity using a stable cell line established in our lab, MDA-MB-231-ARE-Luc, containing an ARE (from GST-Ya)-dependent luciferase gene. Using this method, we have identified a plant extract that is able to inhibit ARE-luciferase activity. Furthermore, a pure compound, brusatol, has been isolated from the extract and has been found to inhibit the protein level of Nrf2 and exhibit potent anti-cancer activities. So far, we have obtained a substantial amount of preliminary data demonstrating that brusatol sensitizes several cancer cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and, more significantly, brusatol sensitizes lung cancer xenografts to cisplatin in vivo in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Based on the ability of brusatol to specifically inhibit Nrf2 and sensitize cultured cancer cells and xenografts to cisplatin treatments, we hypothesize that brusatol can enhance the efficacy of current cancer treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through inhibition of the Nrf2-dependant protective mechanism. The goal of the proposed research is to further characterize the anti-cancer properties of brusatol using a preclinical lung cancer model and delineate the molecular targets and mechanistic actions of brusatol. The proposed study will not only provide a framework for the development of this Nrf2 inhibitor into a therapeutic drug to combat chemoresistance, but also provide the first Nrf2 inhibitor for basic research in the field, both of which will have profound impacts on human health worldwide. Therefore, the following three aims will be pursued: Aim #1. Characterize the mechanistic actions of brusatol-mediated Nrf2 inhibition Nrf2 is primarily regulated by the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase at the protein level through ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, we will investigate the effects of brusatol on the proteins that may enhance the activity of the E3 ligase, such as the protein subunits of the E3 ligase, as well as regulatory proteins that control the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the ligase complex. Aim #2. Determine the molecular targets of brusatol The target proteins of brusatol will be identified and verified. The biological functions of these proteins, in particular their crosstalk with the Nrf2 signaling pathway, wil be investigated. Most likely, these proteins will directly or indirectly regulate the Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 E3 ligase. Aim #3. Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of brusatol using an LSL-KrasG12D/+ mouselung cancer model The feasibility of using brusatol as an adjuvant to enhance current cancer treatments and to combat both intrinsic and acquired resistance will be tested in this preclinical model that recapitulates the development and progression of human lung cancer.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than three billion people live with the threat of malaria throughout the world, which results in a significant impact on the economic stability of developing countries and subsequently on the global economy. While improvements in terms of morbidity, mortality, and transmission have been achieved in the past 5 years, malaria parasites continue to evade elimination. Our long term goal is to aid global malaria elimination efforts through improved detection, diagnosis, and treatment. We hypothesize that the issue of ongoing malaria transmission can be addressed through better assessment of total malaria prevalence (overall) and a more accurate determination of gametocyte prevalence (specific). Without this kind of information many elimination efforts will fail. Our multidisciplinary team of malariologist, physicists, and biomedical engineers exploited the magnetic properties of malaria pigment, hemozoin, to develop a device that utilizes magneto-optical detection (MOD) of hemozoin thereby avoiding staining and microscopy-based examination of patient blood. This inexpensive, portable MOD device uses alternating magnetic fields to align hemozoin so that it blocks transmitted light in proportion to parasitemia (R2=0.9997). Laboratory studies of the MOD device have optimized signal to noise ratios to detect parasitemia < 0.00002% (<1 parasitized cells/µL) with a sensitivity of 94% in less than 1 minute. Further, to determine the levels of gametocytemia we will perform quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on samples which are positive for malaria by MOD. In accordance with the malERA Consultative Group on Diagnosis and Diagnostics recommendations, we will use our methodology (MOD) to conduct population surveillance for active case detection of very low levels of Plasmodium infection to help identify asymptomatic individuals contributing to malaria transmission. Evaluating large numbers of asymptomatic individuals over time will provide the first opportunity to assess the levels of gametocytes in a large population. In conjunction with clinical malaria prevalence and vector intervention we will be able to more effectively model the potential for ongoing malaria transmission. Therefore, this proposal will provide insights needed to predict the potential for resurgence of malaria transmission in endemic regions, which, ultimately, may lead to improved treatment and eradication efforts.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most common hospital-acquired infection worldwide, with an annual cost of approximately $451 million in the United States and an additional $2,900 per CAUTI- related bacteremia. Up to 86% of CAUTIs are polymicrobial, and CAUTI-related bacteremia is also often polymicrobial and carries a high mortality rate. Despite these clinical findings, experimental investigations have focused on single bacterial species in isolation. There is a fundamental gap in understanding of the influence of polymicrobial colonization on transition from asymptomatic bacteriuria to symptomatic CAUTI and the underlying mechanisms of progression from bladder and kidney colonization to bacteremia. Addressing these gaps in knowledge will be critical for developing new therapeutics and intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of CAUTI and enhance quality of life for catheterized individuals. The objective of this career development plan is to complement the candidate's background in bacterial polymicrobial interactions with training in experimental models of CAUTI, innate immunity, histopathology, clinical CAUTI research methods, and next generation sequencing techniques to establish an independent, translational research program investigating the pathogenesis of polymicrobial CAUTI. The central hypothesis of this proposal, guided by substantial preliminary data, is that polymicrobial colonization increases the incidence of bacteremia due to host cell damage from a potent innate immune response and synergistic production of virulence factors. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims that include utilizing a coinfection model developed by the candidate to 1) quantify bladder and kidney damage and identify host factors that contribute to cell damage and progression to bacteremia during coinfection, 2) identify bacterial virulence factors that contribute to bladder and kidney damage and progression to bacteremia during coinfection, and 3) analyze urine cultures and patient-level data from catheterized individuals to determine the influence of polymicrobial colonization on development of CAUTI and adverse outcomes such as bacteremia. An innovative, comprehensive model of polymicrobial infection will be developed through integration of experimental bacterial pathogenesis studies, innate immunity, histopathology, bioinformatics, clinical data, and patient samples. This research is significant because it will assess the influence of polymicrobial colonization on development of adverse and costly CAUTI complications, identify the most problematic bacterial species that correlate with adverse outcomes, and identify host and bacterial targets for therapeutic intervention. The knowledge gained will inform development of intervention strategies to reduce colonization by the most problematic bacterial species and to reduce the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The distinguished mentoring team assembled by the candidate combined with the environment at the University of Michigan will provide exceptional training and support for the proposed study and the candidate's transition to independence.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Salmonellae are Enterobacteriaceae that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans and animals, including enteric (typhoid) fever and gastroenteritis. Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), is a life-threatening systemic disease that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality annually worldwide. Approximately 3-5% of individuals infected with S. Typhi become chronic carriers with the gallbladder (GB) as the site of persistence. S. Typhi is a human-restricted pathogen, therefore asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for further spread of disease. We have demonstrated that gallstones aid in the development and maintenance of GB carriage in a mouse model and in humans, serving as a substrate to which salmonellae attach and form a protective biofilm. However, the molecular basis of chronic carriage of Salmonella in the GB, both from the host and bacterial perspectives, is poorly understood. Our goal is to better understand the environment that allows for asymptomatic chronic carriage and to develop therapies to reverse/prevent it. In Aim 1 of this application, we will examine the ongoing dynamics of the GB response to Salmonella colonization in our gallstone mouse model to better understand the role of the host in permitting asymptomatic chronic carriage. We will focus on the role of immune factors in this process, including IL-10, which we have demonstrated to participate in the development of GB chronic colonization. In Aim 2, we examine the bacterium throughout the establishment of chronic infection, including genes specifically expressed in carriers and putative GB-driven pathoadaptive mutations. In Aim 3, we expand the development of novel treatments for chronic carriage that have emerged from our discovery research efforts. These approaches target kinases required for biofilm formation and the gallstone itself. This work will identify key host and bacterial factors at play during chronic infection of the GB by Salmonella, thus presenting new targets for therapeutic/preventive approaches to eliminate the carrier state.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Classifying disease stage and elucidating a prognosis, which allow the most effective medical intervention, are unattainable when the underlying pathological changes, or the correlates of stage and prognosis, are associated with heterogeneous cells states within a larger population. Single cell analyses can provide an unsurpassed means to measure and unravel heterogeneity in complex biological systems, and thereby to understand the basis for (or to identify correlates of) changes in biological function and disease processes. Here we propose to develop a rapid assay for detection of antigen-specific responses in single T cells from small amounts of blood, based on state-of-the-art techniques that are sensitive and robust. Our proposal aims at developing a test that provides tuberculosis (TB) diagnosticians with the critical ability to distinguish stable latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (when the asymptomatic subject is not progressing to disease, is not infectious, and does not require treatment) from preclinical disease (when the asymptomatic subject is developing disease, is still not infectious, and requires early treatment to block progression of disease and drastically curb transmission of infection). Our multidisciplinary team includes expertise in development of novel single cell analysis methodology, cellular immunology, and biomarker research for TB, which still causes millions of cases of disease and death worldwide every year. Our assay is expected to yield multi-parameter measurements of single T cell functional states by integrating (i) use of artificial Ag-presenting cells (aAPC) to activate T cell receptor signaling and stimulation of gene expression, with (ii) measurement of inducible tell-tale markers of T cell activation and function by quantitative flow cytometry. Induced gene expression will be detected by mRNA enumeration using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). The research plan is articulated in four aims, each focused on the development of a specific aspect of the assay: (1) read-out: detection of activation markers in single T cells by smFISH and flow cytometry following conventional stimulation; (2) stimulation: response to aAPC assessed by detection of activation markers in single T cells; (3) response to infection-stage-specific Ag: association of single T cell responses with disease vs asymptomatic infection; (4) infection-stage-specific functional T cell signatures: multi-parameter characterization of single T cell responses and association with disease vs asymptomatic infection. The proposed plan should lead to recognizing and treating active TB prior to the appearance of microbiological and clinical signs and symptoms of disease. This is the current holy grail in TB diagnosis as it is considered to be critical to TB elimination efforts. The new assay principles will be translatable for diagnosis anddisease staging of any pathology with T cell involvement, including other infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmunity, and transplantation.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, theinterdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors.

Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will provide Timothy Shepherd, M.D. /Ph.D. with a focused training period during which he will refine the skills necessary to become an independent investigator in translational biomedical imaging with a focus on detection of asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease pathology. The career development plan will increase Dr. Shepherd's knowledge and skills in 1) pathologic and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 2) advanced MRI techniques for clinical imaging, and 3) clinical research methodology (including training in scientific integrity and the responsible conduct or research). This will be achieved via highly-structured mentoring, multidisciplinary coursework and seminars across multiple institutions at New York University (NYU). Mentorship will be provided by Fernando Boada, Steven Ferris and Thomas Wisniewski, who are each internationally recognized for their contributions to advanced MRI techniques, clinical and pathological changes in early Alzheimer's disease respectively. Dr. Shepherd also will be mentored by Robert Grossman, the Dean of NYU School of Medicine, a highly-successful clinician- scientist and role model in Dr. Shepherd's clinical specialty. Els Fieremans, a key collaborator is an expert in diffusion kurtosis MRI and modeling. An advisory committee will provide quarterly feedback to Dr. Shepherd and assess his progress so that he meets his training objectives, produce high quality data and publications, and develops a competitive application for RO1 funding at the end of the K23 career development period.  The K23 research plan will test the overall hypothesis that targeted high-resolution MRI can distinguish pathological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures known to be affected early in the disease process. Previous work has demonstrated that structural MRI can be sensitive to the local functional organization of normal tissue and suggests AD pathology changes to tissue organization also will be detectable. The project consists of 2 aims; 1) correlate the hallmarks of AD pathology to changes in the MRI properties (diffusion kurtosis, white matter integrity and T2) of MTL substructure tissue samples (e.g. entorhinal cortex), and 2) use targeted MRI of the MTL to characterize MRI property changes in a cross- sectional study of subjects categorized to different preclinical and clinical stages of AD. This project incorporates multiple innovations that suggest the impact of structural MRI as a biomarker for AD has been underestimated in the past; 1) specifically targeting MTL structures known to be sequentially involved by early AD pathology in asymptomatic patients, 2) novel parallel transmission MRI technology to obtain accurate diffusion data in the MTLs, 3) advanced models of T2 relaxation, diffusion kurtosis and white matter microstructure to better detect local changesin functional tissue organization by AD pathology. Results may warrant further NIH-supported investigation of region-specific targeted MRI as a noninvasive biomarker to diagnose underlying AD pathology and disease progression for asymptomatic patients.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance data of infectious diseases often constitute the first available source for studying the epidemiology of emerging diseases, and proper analysis of surveillance data can provide valuable insights on transmissibility and control strategies. However, proper analysis should address a few challenges. (1) there may be multiple transmission routes, e.g., from environmental reservoir to human and from human to human, and each route has its own spatio-temporal heterogeneity and correlation; (2) there may be multiple types of pathogens co- circulating and causing the same disease, but only a small proportion of cases are sampled to identify the responsible pathogen; and (3) a complex system including immunity, cross-immunity, unobserved asymptomatic infections, together with the birth and aging process of the population may have shaped the demographic, spatial and temporal structure of the surveillance data. Motivated by the Chinese surveillance data of the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) that is caused by a family of enteroviruses (EV), we propose to address above challenges via the following Specific Aims: (1) To build and test a Bayesian modeling framework for surveillance data of co-circulating pathogens to assess pathogen-specific environment-to-human and human-to-human transmissibility and associated risk factors, while accounting for spatio-temporal heterogeneity and correlation in transmissibility; with this model applied to the surveillance data of HFMD in China, to estimate the transmissibility and effects of risk factors for two major enteroviruses, EV 71 and Coxsackie A16; and (2) To extend the modeling framework in Specific Aim 1 with asymptomatic infection, immunity and cross-immunity from previous exposure, and birth, aging and death of the population; to use this extended model to explain the long-term evolvement of the HFMD epidemics, to predict the effectiveness of EV 71 vaccination programs, and to investigate possible replacement of EV 71 by other enteroviruses. Our preliminary simulation study on a simplified model showed feasibility of simultaneous estimation of transmission rates, spatial effects and temporal effects with a moderate number of geographic units and a small amount of laboratory validation. Once the modeling frame work is validated in simulation studies, we will adapt it to multiple years of surveillance data of the HFMD epidemics to detect unknown features about the HMFD-related pathogens, in particular asymptomatic infection and cross-immunity, and to make recommendations about vaccination programs to public health policy-makers. The proposed analytic framework may be generalized, with appropriate customization, to a broad range of acute infectious diseases including influenza, adenovirus, cholera and dengue.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The global health burden of annual influenza epidemics coupled with emerging influenza pandemics highlight the urgent need for new, effective treatments. The majority of current circulating seasonal influenza viruses, as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9, carry the S31N mutant in their M2 genes, which confers resistance to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine). Influenza viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir, the only orally available drug, are continuousy on the rise. Thus there is a persistent need for novel anti-influenza drugs. The M2-S31N mutation is persistent in more than 95% of currently circulating influenza A viruses, and it is oneof the most conserved viral proteins. Therefore inhibitors targeting M2-S31N will be excellent candidates for the next generation of anti-influenza drugs. This proposal focuses on developing M2-S31N channel blockers with favorable drug-like properties and in vivo activities. We implement a multi-faceted approach that includes structure-based drug design, medicinal chemistry, electrophysiology, and virology to design M2-S31N channel blockers. The goal is to develop broad spectrum antiviral drugs that are active against clinical isolates of influenza A viruses that are resistant to one or both classes of currently approved anti-influenza drugs.  In the R21 phase we will focus on optimizing our previously discovered M2-S31N inhibitors as well as exploring novel chemotypes. The inhibitor design will be guided by our previously solved solution NMR structure of M2-S31N. Synthesized molecules will be tested in antiviral assays against clinically relevant influenza A viruses that show resistance to either amantadine or oseltamivir or both. The mechanism of action will be confirmed using electrophysiological assays and solution NMR NOESY spectroscopy. To prioritize compounds for the in vivo studies, we will profile the ADME properties of top lead compounds as well as evaluate their tendencies to elicit drug resistance.  In the R33 phase, we will evaluate the combination therapy potential ofM2-S31N inhibitors with oseltamivir or ribavirin. The structure-activity relationship studies will e driven by the in vitro ADME properties, cytotoxicity, and synergistic effects with oseltamivir or ribavirin. We will assay the in vivo pharmacokinetic ADME properties of up to five compounds in mice. For efficacy studies, mice will be challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted influenza A viruses, and M2-S31N inhibitors will be administrated by oral gavage or tail vein injection. Survival rate, body weight loss, and other clinical signs will be used to evaluate the i vivo efficacy of M2-S31N inhibitors.  Upon successful completion of the proposed studies, we will have at least one compound that is ready for the next stage of studies needed for Investigational New Drug (IND) filling.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to explore a new mechanism of kidney regeneration which is based on newly identified angiogenic and glomerulotrophic functions of macula densa (MD) cells, and to test its potential therapeutic utility in chronic kidny disease (CKD). Our overall, long-term vision is that a new therapeutic approach, fundamentally different from existing strategies, one that amplifies this novel intrinsic renal repair mechanism,will provide the ultimate cure for this devastating disease. The salt-sensing macula densa (MD) cells of the distal tubule are chief cells within the kidney, strategically positioned at the glomerular entrance, and play key sensory and regulatory functions in body fluid- electrolyte homeostasis. Preliminary work using intravital multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of the same intact kidney region over several days provided visual clues that in response to MD-derived signals, mesenchymal progenitor cells residing in the renal interstitium proliferate and migrate towards the MD, and via the vascular pole into the glomerulus and proximal tubules. Therefore we hypothesize that MD cells are master regulators of renal tissue remodeling, and perform this new, non-traditional function via the generation of novel secreted angiogenic and glomerulotrophic factors, and their paracrine actions on the reactivation and recruitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Further, we hypothesize that augmenting these MD mechanisms in CKD may result in rapid tissue remodeling and improved kidney structure and function (regression). This project will use comprehensive experimental approaches including new transgenic mouse models, cell fate tracking, MD transcriptome analysis, bioinformatics, MPM imaging, and a model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The specific aims are to (1) functionally characterize the novel renal tissue remodeling function of MD cells, and to (2) examine the effects of MD activation on kidney structure and function in CKD. These novel MD cell functions may be targeted in the future development of new therapeutic approaches for the better treatment of CKD.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide high-content data that will be used for both basic and preclinical research. BASIC RESEARCH ASPECT: We will use a novel method of high-resolution, subcortical, in vivo imaging to fill critical gaps in knowledge about th dynamics of diffuse traumatic brain injury at a cellular level in subcortical white matter in live mice over a 60-day period post-injury. This knowledge will give us new insights into understanding the progressive degeneration that happens after TBI and for optimizing therapeutic windows for future combination drug therapy. We will obtain these images in live mice using a permanently implanted microlens positioned over a subcortical white matter tract and periodically image through this lens using a multiphoton microscope. We will reveal previously unseen spatio-temporal dynamics of axon degeneration, microglia infiltration and activation, and microvascular changes with cellular resolution in this region. PRECLINICAL ASPECT: We will also use 3 key outcomes from our observations to evaluate the efficacy of a drug which is now in preclinical trials. This drug, minocycline, is an FDA-approved antibiotic thathas reduced axonal loss and microglial activation when given in a single dose within a few hours of experimental traumatic brain injury in mice. We hypothesize that a dose given 3 days post-injury will have the same therapeutic benefits of significantly (1) reducing axonal loss and (2) reducing microglial activation. We further hypothesize that minocycline will result in significant improvement in microcirculation rates. Widening the therapeutic window for this promising drug will better position it for translation to the clinic.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by over-active parathyroid gland(s) and elevated blood calcium levels. Although 80% of PHPT patients are said to be  asymptomatic  (i.e. lacking the classical manifestations of nephrolithiasis and osteitis fibrosa cystica), this term is a misnomer because most patients report neuropsychological symptoms, including reduced memory and concentration. Although both hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) could have cognitive effects, the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PHPT has never been delineated. Most studies do indicate neuropsychological sequelae of PHPT but reversibility after parathyroidectomy (PTX) has been inconsistent across investigations. These inconsistencies may be related to small sample sizes in some studies and variability in the aspects of cognition examined. Because of such limitations, patients with cognitive symptoms are still deemed  asymptomatic  and cognitive dysfunction is not currently an indication for PTX. This remains the biggest unresolved issue in the management of asymptomatic PHPT. Recently, we made progress in this challenging area by showing with validated tools that specific cognitive dysfunction is present in PHPT and improves after surgical cure. A potential vascular mechanism is suggested by our work demonstrating increased aortic and carotid vascular stiffness in PHPT in association with extent of PTH elevation. Our new preliminary data supports the presence of similar PTH-dependent changes in the intracerebral vasculature that may underlie cognitive impairment in PHPT. There is support for this concept from work showing that cerebral hemodynamic dysfunction is associated with cognitive impairment in vascular dementia and carotid disease. Moreover, a recent epidemiological study found elevated PTH to be a risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults. The proposed studies are intended to determine if the above PTH-dependent vascular mechanism is responsible for cognitive dysfunction in PHPT, whether the process is attributable to PTH and reversible with cure of PHPT, and which brain regions are affected. First, we will use transcranial Doppler to confirm that intra- cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) is reduced in PHPT, and associated with elevated PTH (but not calcium) and cognitive changes. Second, we will determine if impaired VMR is reversible with PTX. Finally, we will identify the sites in the brain affected by PHPT usingfunctional magnetic resonance imaging. The data from these studies will address a research goal of the 4th International Conference on Asymptomatic PHPT (2013), which highlighted the need for data regarding the cognitive effects of PHPT. Ultimately this information may lead to alteration of surgical guidelines for PHPT patients. Further, if our hypothesis regarding PTH-dependent changes in cerebral vascular function and cognition is confirmed, these data would have implications for a much broader and larger group of patients with PTH excess, including those with secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease and other disorders.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Commercialization of a blood diagnostic for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease  The goal of this research is to demonstrate proof of concept in being able to utilize a disease marker in the blood to develop a diagnostic 'test' for the early detection and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. By 2050 the incidence of AD is expected to approach 1 million/year with a total estimated prevalence of 11-16 million at a cost of $172B. It is generally recognized that effective treatments for slowing or halting disease progression will have to be administered very early following onset of the disease. Identification of a robust blood test for identifying ealy AD will be essential as a population screening tool for identifying at-risk individuals for therapeutic interventions aimed at both halting disease progression and/or modifying the rate of cognitive decline. The sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and brain imaging technologies to stage AD disease progression are improving, but fall short of being used as regular screening techniques for various reasons. At present there are no accepted biomarkers in blood that are clinically useful to identify individuals for developing AD.  Recent discoveries have demonstrated that autoantibodies circulate in blood that have their antigen binding sites 'masked' such that they do not react with self-antigens. A novel class of masked autoantibodies against phospholipids (aPL) universally present in blood have been demonstrated to be present using proprietary technology to oxidatively 'unmask' autoantibody aPL reactivity. These redox-reactive autoantibodies (R-RAA) in blood samples can be quantitatively measured using standard clinical 'antigen down' ELISA assay formats, and form the basis of the diagnostic test.  Studies have been completed that demonstrate that the level of R-RAA aPL are significantly elevated in blood samples from subjects with amnestic Mild Cognitively Impaired (MCI) compared to blood samples taken from cognitively normal age-matched healthy subjects. NIH SBIR funding will be used to enable testing of blood samples taken from a relatively large number of subjects over a period of time (longitudinal studies). The R-RAA aPL data from these studies will allow comparison of blood biomarker levels taken when subjects are asymptomatic and followed as the earliest signs of cognitive impairment become apparent. The studies will determine if the biomarker can be used for identifying at-risk asymptomatic individuals early in disease progression. A successful outcome of these studies will determine if clinical validation and commercialization of the R-RAA aPL diagnostic test is warranted for use as a screening tool to meet this very challenging unmet medical need.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) is a class 1 membrane fusion machine that mediates virus entry into cells. HIV-1 Env consists of a trimer of gp120/gp41 heterodimers. Interaction with the CD4 receptor causes structural rearrangements in gp120, which lead to formation of a coreceptor-binding site. Subsequent interactions with the coreceptor trigger additional Env refolding, with gp41 rearranging into a stable six-helix bundle that is believed to drive fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Recent progress in the structural understanding have provided static images of the pre-fusion conformation of the HIV-1 Env trimer and post-fusion conformation of gp41. However, direct visualization of the conformational transitions, characterization of structural intermediates that lead to membrane fusion have been lacking. To provide insights into the dynamics of the native trimer, we have established single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging to measure the conformational changes of individual Env molecule in the context of a native trimer on the surface of intact virions. Our studies revealed that the unliganded HIV-1 Env is intrinsically dynamic, transitioning between three distinct prefusion conformations, whose relative occupancies were remodeled by receptor CD4 and antibody binding. Our analysis also directly reveals molecular and temporal events in gp120 that underlie the two-step activation of HIV-1 Env by CD4 and coreceptor through a necessary structural intermediate. Here we propose to concentrate on the next important goal, to directly visualize the conformational events within gp41 that lead to mixing between viral and cellular membranes. Towards this end, we have established suppressor tRNA technologies to introduce unnatural amino acids in mammalian cells. The introduction of a single fluorophore in gp41 in combination with an existing one in gp120 will monitor how CD4 primes gp41 and binding of co-receptor disrupts the association between gp41 and gp120. The insertion of two fluorophores before and after switch regions within HR1 and HR2 regions of gp41 will reveal how individual conformational transitions within the Env trimer lead to fusion peptide exposure and membrane fusion. Because our methods allows insights into the conformational state of native HIV-1 Env trimer on the surface of complete virions, we are also uniquely positioned to evaluate to what extent soluble or precursor constructs currently used to structurally characterize the HIV-1 Env trimer display features of the native Env. An increased understanding of the conformational events underlying HIV-1 Env activation will inform antiviral therapies and vaccine design.',\n",
       " 'This research will develop a mathematical model to understand the role of asymptomatic infections and protective immunity on the spread of Ebola virus. Based on their previous research the investigators have shown that 20-60% of people exposed to Ebola virus never develop clinical disease and remain asymptomatic.  It is unclear if a person who is asymptomatically infected gains protective immunity against future exposure to the Ebola virus. If asymptomatic infections do offer protection, this could be extremely important in understanding and reducing the spread of Ebola virus. As part of the project, the investigators will develop and share easy-to-use, open access modeling tools that can be utilized by the public health policy and research community.  The research team proposes five specific aims in modeling and understanding asymptomatic infections. They will design and study public health interventions that could leverage the effects of this protective immunity. One such strategy would include modeling a potential workforce comprised of caregivers who have been asymptomatically infected to establish a viral barrier similar to a ring vaccination strategy. They will characterize the implications of asymptomatic infections for vaccine trial design. They will utilize latent process models to determine if asymptomatic infections contributed to the scope and decline of previous Ebola epidemics, looking to see if there is a signature of asymptomatic immunity within an Ebola outbreak.',\n",

       " 'The long-term goal of this research is to bring a scientific perspective to the role of rotations in disease management based on an in-depth understanding of the interactions between the pathogen (in our case, Verticillium dahliae) and plant species, so that new sustainable and environmentally-friendly management practices based on rotations can be designed. Although Verticillium wilts are primarily managed through rotations with asymptomatic hosts, the efficacy of these rotations has been extremely inconsistent depending on the field and/or growing region. The research proposed here intends to be proof-of-concept that one mechanism by which an asymptomatic rotational crop such as oat can impact disease severity in a subsequent potato crop is through a change or shift in the pathogen population composition. This genotypic shift results from the endophytic interaction between the asymptomatic host and the pathogen. To address this hypothesis we will use a combination of field, microbiological and genetic analyses. Replicated field microplots will be infested with specific mixtures of V. dahliae genotypes and subjected to an oat-potato rotation. We will then monitor shifts in genotypic diversity due to the endophytic interaction of the fungus with the asymptomatic rotational crop oat. The genotype shift in soil V. dahliae populations will be identified based on the quantification of the frequencies of the genotypes present in soil based on Illumina sequencing of SNPs diagnostic for each genotype. We will also monitor disease development to make correlations between genotype shifts and disease suppression.',\n",

Examples are Phytophthora root rot, soybean cyst nematode, Fusarium root rot, Pythium damping-off, Sclerotinia stem rot, and seedling diseases of soybean. Various methods are used to study these diseases and the pathogens that cause the diseases.

       " \"Summary of work: As part of our program of research on early markers of Alzheimers disease, we are performing serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including measures of vascular changes, positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological assessments in participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to investigate the neurobiological basis of memory change and cognitive impairment. These evaluations allow us to examine changes in brain structure and function which may be early predictors of cognitive change and impairment, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We are continuing longitudinal testing of older participants and evaluating new participants, including MRI and concurrent neuropsychological assessments of participants less than 55 years old. For a subsample of individuals aged 55 and older, we also perform a single PET measurement of cerebral blood flow, followed by a PET scan using 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) to measure in vivo amyloid distribution. Our progress over the last year includes continued acquisition of new neuroimaging assessments as well as continued analysis of existing data and methods development. The MRI research protocol has been expanded to all BLSA participants eligible for MRI scanning and includes a resting state functional MR (rsfMR) and task activated fMR, alternating between a decision making task and an associative memory task.  Approximately half of the neuroimaging study participants are enrolled in the BLSA autopsy program, and we continue to use the 3-dimensional imaging findings to guide neuropathological investigations.  In addition, we are using neuroimaging tools to investigate modulators of cognitive and brain changes, including sex differences in cognitive and brain aging, genetic, metabolic, and inflammatory risk factors, and the effects of sex steroid and other hormones. An understanding of these brain-behavior associations and early detection of accelerated brain changes during the preclinical or asymptomatic stage of disease will be critical in identifying individuals likely to benefit from interventions if a successful treatment for prevention or delaying onset of disease is available.  These studies also inform the neurobiology and temporal progression of presymptomatic changes in Alzheimer's disease and may point to new targets for treatments.Over the last year, we have published a number of papers describing a variety of results from the BLSA neuroimaging study.  Expanding on our prior work identifiying changes in brain function occurring years before cognitive impairment, we investigated cortical thinning over time in BLSA participants who remained cognitively normal versus those who subsequently developed cognitive impairment (Pacheco et al., 2015).  We demonstrated wide-spread cortical thinning in individuals who remained normal, but regionally selective greater thinning in participants who subsequently developed cognitive impairment.  Even though all participants were cognitively normal at the time of all MRI scans, the subgroup who developed subsequent cognitive impairment showed greater thinning in the temporal lobe, most pronounced in the medial temporal lobe, compared to those who remained normal.  These findings show that specific brain changes accelerate in the earliest asymptomatic stages of disease.  In another study, we found that hypertension is one factor that may modulate rates of cortical thinning (Gonzalez et al, 2015).  Comparing hypertensives to normotensives, we found that hypertensive individuals show an increased rate of thinning compared with normotensive individuals in several regions, including the frontomarginal gyrus in the left hemisphere, and the superior temporal, fusiform, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex in the right hemisphere.In collaboration with Dr. Marilyn Albert and her team at Johns Hopkins University, we showed changes over time in amyloid-betta(A&#946;)in two longitudinal cohorts with different biomarkers of amyloid-beta and investigated how level and change in A&#946; is modified by Apolipoprotein E (APOE)&#949;4 genotype (Resnick et al, 2015).  We used 11-C-Pib PET imaging of A&#946; in 113 BLSA participants and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A&#946; in 207 BIOCARD study participants to demonstrate longitudinal increases in brain A&#946; and decreases in CSF A&#946;.  Moreover, APOE &#949;4 genotype was significantly associated with higher PET-PiB retention and lower CSF A&#946;1-42, independent of age and sex, but APOE genotype did not significantly affect A&#946; change over time. These findings suggest that APOE &#949;4 carriers may be further along in the disease process, consistent with earlier brain A&#946; deposition, and providing a biological basis for APOE genotype effects on onset age of Alzheimer's disease.As part of this research program, we have continued to perform a number of methodological studies to optimize the application of our neuroimaging approaches.  In an important study, we investigated voxel-wise correlations between cerebral blood flow and PET-PiB retention (Sojkova et al., 2015).  We found higher associations between blood flow and PiB in the group with the lowest global cortical PiB retention compared to the high global PIB retention group.  These findings show that regional patterns of PiB retention at neglible amyloid levels reflect blood flow and tracer delivery than regional amyloid levels.  This finding has critical implications for voxel-wise correlation of PiB or other amyloid PET scans with other outcomes, e.g. cognitive performance. In addition, work under this project has led to the development of an approach using a deformable template to define regions of interest on PET scans where MRI scans are not available (Bilgel et al., 2015).In another methodological study, we investigated the test-retest stability and scan-to-scan reliability of regional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans acquired on scanners from different vendors and different field strengths (Venkatraman et al., 2015). We highlighted specific indices and regions that could be consistently measured and showed how measurement stability could be enhanced by statistical incorporation of a scanner correction factor.\",\n",
       " 'Obesity is a huge and increasing medical problem, with inadequate therapeutic options.  One approach to the treatment of obesity is long-term pharmacotherapy.  One modestly effective drug, orlistat, has been marketed in the United States since 1999.  More recently other drugs have been approved by the FDA: lorcaserin and Qsymia (a combination of phentermine and topiramate) in 2012 and Contrave (a combination of buproprion and naltrexone) and liraglutide (high dose) in 2014.  The limited efficacy of single agents has led to the idea that additional agents and combination therapy are required.  Progress in FY2015 includes the following:  In 2014 we published a re-examination of chemical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) as a treatment for obesity in mice.  DNP was an effective and widely used weight loss drug in the early 1930s.  DNP treatment increased energy expenditure but did not change food intake.  DNP-treated mice weighed 26% less than controls after 2 months of treatment due to decreased fat mass, without a change in lean mass. DNP improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic steatosis without observed toxicity. DNP treatment also reduced brown adipose tissue activity, demonstrating that DNP-mediated heat generation substituted for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.  At 22 C, a typical vivarium temperature that is below thermoneutrality, DNP treatment had no effect on body weight, adiposity, or glucose homeostasis. Thus, environmental temperature should be considered when assessing an anti-obesity drug in mice, particularly agents acting on energy expenditure. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of DNP suggest that chemical uncouplers deserve further investigation for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities.  This year, we reported the effects of CL316243, a beta3-adrenergic agonist studied under similar conditions.  To our surprise, the interaction between environmental temperature and CL316243 treatment is different from the interaction between environmental temperature and 2,4-dinitrophenol treatment reported previously, suggesting that each drug mechanism must be examined to understand the effect of environmental temperature on drug efficacy.',\n",
       " 'A part of this project focuses on leiomyomata (fibroids) and examines factors related to their pathogenesis, diagnosis and/or potential treatment.    We previously investigated the effect of single doses of the agent on the menstrual cycle in women, and showed that doses of 100 or 200 mg retard folliculogenesis and precipitate menses, in the follicular and luteal phase respectively.  Two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials from our group showed reduction in fibroid size in women receiving CDB 2914 at a daily dose of 10 or 20 mg for three months, as compared to women receiving placebo. One of these studies showed continued efficacy during a second three-month study. We  also are using gene arrays to evaluate the pathophysiology of leiomyomata.To evaluate the role of estradiol in depression, we studied asymptomatic postmenopausal women with past perimenopausal depression (PMD) responsive to hormone therapy and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no history of depression matched for age, body mass index, and reproductive status who served as controls. After 3 weeks of open-label administration of transdermal estradiol (100 g/d), participants were randomized to a parallel design to receive either estradiol (100 g/d; 27 participants) or matched placebo skin patches (29 participants) for 3 additional weeks under double-blind conditions.None of the women reported depressive symptoms during open-label use of estradiol. Women with past PMD who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity demonstrated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, with mean (SD) scores increasing from estradiol (ie, 2.4 2.0 and 3.0 2.5) to placebo (8.8 4.9 and 6.6 4.5, respectively p=.0004 for both). Women with past PMD who continued estradiol therapy and all women in the control group remained asymptomatic. Women in both groups had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during use of placebo.In women with past PMD that was previously responsive to hormone therapy, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. To evaluate the role of neurosteroids in mood, we stabilized neurosteroid levels by administering the 5&#945;-reductase inhibitor dutasteride to block conversion of progesterone to its neurosteroid metabolite allopregnanolone in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and in asymptomatic control women. Sixteen women with prospectively confirmed PMDD and 16 control women participated in one of two separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials, each lasting three menstrual cycles. After one menstrual cycle of single-blind placebo, participants were randomized to receive, for the next two menstrual cycles, either double blind placebo or dutasteride (low-dose 0.5&#8201;mg/day in the first 8 PMDD and 8 control women or high-dose 2.5&#8201;mg/day in the second group of women). All women completed the Daily Rating Form (DRF) and were evaluated in clinic during the follicular and luteal phases of each menstrual cycle. Main outcome measures were the DRF symptoms of irritability, sadness, and anxiety. In the low-dose group, no significant effect of dutasteride on PMDD symptoms was observed compared with placebo (ie, symptom cyclicity maintained), and plasma allopregnanolone levels increased in women with PMDD from follicular to the luteal phases, suggesting the absence of effect of the low-dose dutasteride on 5&#945;-reductase. In contrast, the high-dose group experienced a statistically significant reduction in several core PMDD symptoms (ie, irritability, sadness, anxiety, food cravings and bloating) on dutasteride compared with placebo. Dutasteride had no effect on mood in controls.

       " 'While it is clear that HIV-1 assembly occurs predominantly on the plasma membrane (PM), the itinerary that the Gag precursor follows to reach its destination remains ill defined. _____Likewise, the host cell machinery that promotes Gag trafficking to the PM is incompletely understood. We and others have demonstrated that the matrix (MA) domain of Gag regulates targeting to the site of virus assembly, and we discovered that the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 and the ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) serve important functions in directing Pr55Gag to the PM. We are actively engaged in studies to elucidate further the cellular machinery involved in HIV-1 Gag trafficking. This effort combines virology, biochemistry, cell biology, and imaging techniques and is also being extended to the nonprimate lentiviruses equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Proteins of particular interest in this area include the Arf proteins, SNAREs, F-BAR domain proteins, and clathrin. In studies related to Gag trafficking, we are also investigating the host cell machinery required for Gag localization to, and virus transfer across, the virological synapse. The viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins are incorporated into virions during the assembly process. We have shown that point mutations in the MA domain of Gag block Env incorporation, and demonstrated that the long gp41 cytoplasmic tail plays a cell-type-dependent role in Env incorporation. Despite the evidence for a direct interaction between MA and the gp41 cytoplasmic tail, the molecular mechanism by which Env is incorporated and the basis for cell type dependence of cytoplasmic tail function remain to be defined. We will address the hypothesis that host cell factors are likely to play an important role in Env incorporation into virions. We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay for Gag-Env interaction that will be useful in evaluating this hypothesis. We have also demonstrated that MA trimerization plays a critical role in Env incorporation and have identified residues that are required for MA trimer formation. _____[Corresponds to Freed Project 1 in the October 2011 site visit report of the HIV DRP]',\n",
       " \"Personnel: I received my PhD in genetic epidemiology, hold an MA in molecular and cellular biology, and am a certified pharmacist. I aim to become a leading genetic epidemiologist working on  Stomach Cancer  in the field of  Genetic cancer research,  two of the Fiscal Year 2015 (FY15) Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program (PRCRP) Horizon Award Topic Areas. For my doctoral degree, I studied breast cancer genetic susceptibility among Asian women. As a postdoctoral fellow at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DECG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), my research area expanded to stomach cancer. Including my most recent publications in gastric cancer genetic susceptibility and Helicobacter pylori infection, I have published 28 peer-reviewed manuscripts (9 as first author; 19 pertinent to  cancer genetics  and/or  stomach cancer ). As co-mentors for this proposal, I have chosen Drs. Philip Taylor and Charles Rabkin, who are accomplished medical epidemiologists in the field of stomach cancer and senior investigators at DCEG/NCI. Their dedication and contributions to the field of stomach cancer epidemiology are evident by their numerous peer-reviewed publications including seminal articles in top-tier journals. Dr. Taylor's work contributed to advance knowledge about H. pylori infection, genetic susceptibility, and chemoprevention. He was named as an Outstanding Mentor in NCI. Dr. Rabkin has devoted his research to infection-related cancers. In particular, his studies added important insights into Epstein-Barr virus-positive stomach cancer. He is the co-chair of the microbiome subcommittee of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis working group on upper gastrointestinal cancers. He has a strong track record of training and mentoring early-career scientists who have successfully transitioned to independent researchers. Research Development: The current proposal addresses the critical need for stomach cancer biomarkers that can detect cancer early and inform clinical care so as to reduce the burden of this malignancy. Pursuing this work will increase my expertise in the area of cancer biomarkers and improve the research skill set I need to become an independent researcher. This Horizon Award will advance my career development by allowing me to (i) follow-up tantalizing preliminary results and disseminate important findings in the scientific literature; (ii) gain experience in the process of obtaining peer-reviewed research funding; (iii) enhance my ability to obtain a tenure-track position outside of NCI; and (iv) ultimately become an independent investigator with unique capabilities for genetic cancer research on stomach cancer. Research: Background: Almost one million new cases of stomach cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2012, making it the fifth most common malignancy in the world. Five-year survival for 2005-2011 in the United States was less than 30%, since stomach cancer is generally asymptomatic in early stages and has often metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Identification of biomarkers for early-stage disease is crucial to the development of effective screening strategies and to improved survival. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs in an early phase of carcinogenesis and, importantly, can be detected in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is thought to be derived from preneoplastic or tumor tissues. We are currently comparing 10 candidate CpG sites in cfDNA from stomach cancer cases and controls from a Polish study. In the proposed study, we will use samples from high-risk populations in China to select the best four CpG sites and evaluate their prediagnostic predictive value in a prospective cohort study. Objective: To identify and validate plasma DNA methylation as a potential biomarker for the detection of stomach cancer.Specific Aims: (i) Validate the performance of 10 CpG methylation sites to distinguish stomach cancer cases vs. healthy controls from a Chinese case-control study. (ii) Test the top four CpG site candidates from the validation for the prediagnostic predictive performance in a prospective cohort study from China by comparing asymptomatic subjects who later develop cancer to those who do not. (iii) Investigate the functional relevance of these candidate CpG sites through in silico and functional annotation. Study Design: (i) Case-control study: The 10 CpG sites will be tested among samples from 50 cases and 50 age-sex-matched controls. (ii) Prospective cohort study: The top four CpG sites will be tested in samples from 170 asymptomatic subjects who later develop cancer and 170 age-sex-matched controls who do not. (iii) In silico and functional annotation: The correlations of methylation levels with mRNA expression and SNP genotype will be assessed. Impact: Our study will directly address the usefulness of plasma DNA methylation biomarkers for the early detection of stomach cancer. If shown to be valid, these biomarkers have the potential to transform stomach cancer screening and contribute to early detection, FY15 PRCRP Military Relevance Focus areas. The ultimate outcome of our study will reduce disease-related mortality and improve survival in military members, Veterans, and their families as well as the general public.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTCORE Component: Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and acute respiratory illness (ARI) are the leading causes ofdeath worldwide in children <5 years old beyond the neonatal period. The primary established leading viraletiologies of AGE are rotavirus and norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza for ARI. Ourunderstanding of AGE and ARI epidemiology is constantly changing due to seasonal fluctuations, discovery ofnew or re-emerging pathogens, and use of rotavirus and influenza vaccines. Hence, surveillance efforts areimperative to better understand AGE and ARI disease burden, causative pathogens, outcomes, and vaccineimpact. Our team of Vanderbilt investigators is highly experienced in conducting prospective, population-basedAGE and ARI surveillance with laboratory-confirmed enteric and respiratory viruses. For this project, wepropose to conduct prospective AGE and ARI surveillance in Davidson County, TN, with the following specificaims for the core component: 1) To determine age-specific association rates of AGE with specific entericviruses using active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed gastroenteritis viruses in childrenpresenting to the emergency department and in hospitalized children. 2) To determine age-specific associationrates of ARI with specific respiratory viruses using active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viruses in children presenting to the emergency department and in inpatient hospitalizedchildren. 3) To determine annual influenza vaccine efficacy (VE) in preventing hospitalizations of children <18years of age due to laboratory-confirmed influenza using a test-negative study design.OPTIONAL Component: As part of the optional component of the grant, we plan to establish a birth cohort of250 children; infants will be followed from birth through their second birthday, death, or lost to follow-up,whichever comes first. We will systemically collect specimens (e.g., respiratory, stool, and blood) to understandthe natural history of AGE and ARI pathogens during early childhood and to understand immunological andepidemiological factors that can affect symptomatic and asymptomatic status. The specific aims for theoptional component include:1) To establish a prospective birth cohort of children who resideNashville/Davidson County, TN to study etiologic, sociodemographic, environmental, and immunologic factorsassociated with childhood ARI and AGE and the dynamics of household transmission of respiratory andgastrointestinal infections during the first two years of life. 2) To determine the natural history of respiratoryinfections and host immune responses related to symptomatic and asymptomatic periods in the birth cohortover two years. 3) To determine the natural history of gastrointestinal infections and host immune responsesrelated to symptomatic and asymptomatic periods in the birth cohort over two years.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retrovirus HIV, the etiological agent of the global AIDS epidemic, has been a major health concern since its discovery in 1981. Currently, the most successful treatment regimen is the highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which combines three or four of the current 26 FDA-approved HIV drugs in treatment. Half of these drugs target the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme that is essential for viral replication. Among the RT inhibitors, five are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) which bind to an allosteric pocket of RT. NNRTIs can inhibit the polymerase function by themselves, or synergistically with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that bind to the active site of the enzyme. Currently, NNRTIs are always combined with NRTIs in HAART to maximize synergy and efficacy. Although HAART has been successful in extending the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals, several limitations to this treatment regimen exist, including solubility of individual drug, long-term toxic side effects and drug resistance. Therefore, the long term goal of this research is to develop safer, next generation therapeutics with improved pharmacological properties (PK/PD) and solubility that can overcome resistant variants. Using computational approaches, we have previously developed novel NNRTIs that have very potent antiviral activity (best EC50 = 530 pM) against HIV-1 as well as resistant variants of HIV-1 with common RT mutations. Moreover, our compounds exhibit much lower cytotoxicity and higher solubility than the FDA-approved second generation NNRTIs etravirine and rilpivirine. In order to further develop these compounds into useful therapeutics, binding affinity and association/dissociation rates will be determined using pre-steady state kinetics. Moreover, RT- inhibitor interactions will be elucidated with x-ray crystallography to provide a platform for rational drug design. Furthermore, antiviral activity of novel NNRTIs developed in our lab will be measured using cell-based assays, and changes in potency when combined with current FDA-approved NRTIs will be examined to find the combination that displays the highest synergistic effect. Finally, the molecular mechanism of NRTI-NNRTI synergy will be investigated by solving a quaternary RT:DNA:NRTI:NNRTI structure. Overall, this research will allow us to develop more potent NNRTIs with improved pharmacological properties, and identify the optimal combination of NNRTI and NRTI for combination therapy that should lower treatment failure rate and delay development of resistance.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide high-content data that will be used for both basic and preclinical research. BASIC RESEARCH ASPECT: We will use a novel method of high-resolution, subcortical, in vivo imaging to fill critical gaps in knowledge about th dynamics of diffuse traumatic brain injury at a cellular level in subcortical white matter in live mice over a 60-day period post-injury. This knowledge will give us new insights into understanding the progressive degeneration that happens after TBI and for optimizing therapeutic windows for future combination drug therapy. We will obtain these images in live mice using a permanently implanted microlens positioned over a subcortical white matter tract and periodically image through this lens using a multiphoton microscope. We will reveal previously unseen spatio-temporal dynamics of axon degeneration, microglia infiltration and activation, and microvascular changes with cellular resolution in this region. PRECLINICAL ASPECT: We will also use 3 key outcomes from our observations to evaluate the efficacy of a drug which is now in preclinical trials. This drug, minocycline, is an FDA-approved antibiotic that has reduced axonal loss and microglial activation when given in a single dose within a few hours of experimental traumatic brain injury in mice. We hypothesize that a dose given 3 days post-injury will have the same therapeutic benefits of significantly (1) reducing axonal loss and (2) reducing microglial activation. We further hypothesize that minocycline will result in significant improvement in microcirculation rates. Widening the therapeutic window for this promising drug will better position it for translation to the clinic.',\n",
       " 'William M. Geisler, M.D., M.P.H., is a mid-career stage physician scientist at the University of Alabama atBirmingham (UAB) with independent federal funding, expertise in Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections, andsignificant experience in mentoring early career stage trainees in patient-oriented research (POR). Thismidcareer investigator award would enable Dr. Geisler to: 1) further develop his mentoring skills, 2) continueproviding POR mentoring to early career stage trainees, and 3) expand his research program in new directionsby supporting two new research projects. CT infections are highly prevalent in young females (adolescents andyoung adults) and can cause significant reproductive morbidity when untreated. Since the majority of CTinfections are asymptomatic, they are often unrecognized and may go untreated. CT detection relies in largepart on screening young females annually. Because provider compliance with CT screening is low andscreening at an annual interval misses many infections that resolve spontaneously or are incidentally treated,the cumulative burden of CT infection in asymptomatic young females is unknown. Another missed opportunityfor treating CT infection is in females with CT-associated dysuria who are misdiagnosed with a urinary tractinfection (UTI), often prescribed UTI treatment ineffective against CT, and usually not tested for CT. With award support, Dr. Geisler plans to expand and refine his mentoring skills through didactics andtraining, and to continue mentoring his current early stage trainees and recruit new trainees through multipleUAB sources. All trainees will be provided with educational and research experiences tailored to their careerstage and interests. With award support, Dr. Geisler’s research program will be augmented through two newstudies addressing missed opportunites for CT detection and treatment, which will provide new opportunitiesfor mentoring trainees, collaborations, and funding. The Aim of New Study 1 is: Evaluate the cumulativeburden of CT infection in female adolescents and young adults and predictors of higher burden. Females ages16-29 years will be enrolled at 4 UAB clinics with different patient populations. Subjects will be interviewed andundergo urine CT testing and serum CT antibody testing. Cumulative burden of CT infection representspositivity by either test. The Aim of New Study 2 is: Determine the frequency of CT infection in femaleadolescents and young adults presenting with dysuria and the patient and urine characteristics that distinguishCT infection from UTI. Females ages 16-29 years presenting to the UAB Emergency Department with dysuriawill be enrolled, interviewed, undergo urogenital CT testing, and have a urine dipstick and bacterial cultureperformed. The long-term goal of Dr. Geisler’s research is to improve prevention and control of CT infection.Knowledge from the new studies could lead to improve CT screening strategies in young asymptomaticfemales and more testing and treatment in females presenting with CT-associated dysuria. The researchstudies will provide mentoring opportunities in POR for multiple early stage trainees.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACTHuman prion diseases are infectious and invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadicCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common form, and variant CJD (vCJD) which is associated toconsumption of cattle meat infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Currently there is not sensitive,objective and non-invasive biochemical diagnosis for these diseases, and even less a procedure to detectpeople incubating the disease in the pre-symptomatic period. This is a major problem for public health, becauseprion diseases are known to transmit iatrogenically between human-to-human and because due to the long pre-symptomatic stage of the disease—which may span five decades—the asymptomatic carriers far outnumber theclinically affected individuals. To make the situation even more complicated, the infectious agent responsible forthese diseases, termed prion, is composed exclusively of a conformationally altered form of a naturally occurringprotein, named PrPSc, which has the unique ability to infect individuals and propagate in the body without theneed for genetic material. PrPSc is not only the infectious agent and the likely culprit of neurodegeneration, butalso the best surrogate marker for the disease. The challenge is that its quantity is high only in the brain at latestages of the disease. However, compelling evidences indicate that PrPSc is present in minute amounts invarious peripheral tissues and biological fluids, including blood.This proposal is a continuation of a previously funded phase I/II fast track STTR project (R42NS079060) whosemajor goal was to develop a blood- and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based detection assay for PrPSc associatedwith sCJD and vCJD. Our strategy utilizes the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique, apioneering proprietary technology developed in Dr Soto's lab. PMCA enables highly efficient prion replication inthe test tube by amplification of this process in vitro, and offers a great opportunity to detect very small quantitiesof prions. During the previous funding cycle we were highly successful to reach the main aims and milestones,including the substantial optimization and improvement of the technology for human samples and the detectionof PrPSc in samples of blood and urine of patients affected by vCJD with sensitivity and specificity approaching100%. Another goal of the phase II was to obtain approval for using PMCA for disease diagnosis. Currently, avariation of the PMCA assay is successfully under use by the USA CJD Surveillance Center based onCleveland, OH to help the diagnosis of CJD and Amprion is receiving royalty payments for this application.However, given the small number of cases, the diagnosis market is not profitable at this time. Amprion regardsthe screening of the blood supply as the most relevant market for commercialization of the Company'stechnology. Based on the success achieved during the phase I and II of this project we engaged in extensivediscussions with the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), the governmentalorganism trusted with the responsibility to validate and approve prion detection techniques in the UK and theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) to define the regulatory pathway to get approval for detection of prions inhuman blood. As a result of these discussions we have agreed to a validation pathway defined by theseagencies to obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of a PMCA-based assay for detection of prionsin human blood samples and started the phase I of this process.The main goal of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) project is to complete the regulatory and marketapproval of our test for detecting prions in blood of people infected by the vCJD agent and to increase thethroughput of the assay to handle the number of samples expected during commercialization. The validationpathway includes 4 steps, namely: (i) testing a panel of blood samples spiked with vCJD brain or spleenextracts, (ii) a large screening of negative samples to assess specificity, (iii) a panel of samples from non-humanprimates infected with the vCJD agent and (iv) a group of samples from patients with confirmed vCJD. Thesesamples will be provided blindly by the NIBSC or the FDA.The results generated in this project would lead to the development of a validated biochemical test to detectvCJD prions in human blood and the demonstration that this can be achieved before the clinical onset of thedisease in asymptomatic carriers through the longitudinal studies in non-human primates experimentally infectedwith the vCJD agent. Availability of a validated methodology to screen blood for infectious prions will increasethe safety of blood transfusions and potentially also products derived from human plasma. Finally, such ascreening test could be utilized for a study of the size of the asymptomatic population of carriers (i.e. the numberof people infected with the vCJD agent who have not yet developed the clinical disease). For commercializationof the validated test, Amprion will establish validated reference laboratories in different geographic locations (e.g.North America, Europe, Asia) that can handle the centralized testing of the samples with the accuracy, efficiencyand safety needed for this type of assays.\",\n",

       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle: Chen, Ridong Abstract Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, renal failure, blindness, amputations and hospitalization. Up to 80% of T2D patients are overweight or obese, which induces chronic, low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue and promotes insulin resistance and T2D. Moreover, weight gain is the common side-effect of older anti-diabetic drugs. Current therapies are not a cure and require daily administration. Hence, novel therapy that improves glucose control while simultaneously reducing body weight is urgently needed. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) modulate inflammation and insulin resistance. Very interestingly, Treg cells with a unique phenotype are highly enriched in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of normal animals, but their numbers are strikingly and specifically reduced in insulin-resistant models of obese animals. Importantly, decreased numbers of Treg are also found in obese human omental. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is the key cytokine for the generation, survival, and function of Treg by direct binding to its high affinity receptor.Hence, restoration of VAT Treg cells with low-dose IL2 may offer a novel strategy for mitigating obesity related low-grade inflammation and reversing insulin resistance and T2D. We have designed an IL2-based therapy that will enable selective stimulation of Tregs. In the proposed Phase I SBIR study, we will determine whether weekly treatment for 4 weeks leads to improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose control, while reducing excessive body weight gain in the T2D models of obese db/db mice and diet-induced obese mice. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel treatment (weekly or bi-weekly) for T2D, alone or in combination with current therapies, to improve glucose homeostasis and attenuate diabetes-associated complications while simultaneously reducing excessive body weight gain.',\n",

Recent genetic findings have identified mutations in synaptic cell adhesion genes and genes encoding their interacting protein partners at central synapses as genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders. This proposal will characterize novel and innovative autism mouse models that allow for brain development to take place with a genetic mutation. These particular models allow for reversal of the mutation at various times during brain development and ultimately in specific brain regions. The goal is to narrow the developmental critical period during which such mutations lead to altered brain function and atypical behavior. This information will allow scientists to focus specifically on the time periods and brain regions critical for generation of atypical behavior. In addition, these studies will substantiate feasibility of genetic and certain pharmacological approaches to treatment of a genetic form of autism. Progress to date is substantial in that the genetically reversible mutant mouse models related to autism have been established and characterization has begun.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, affecting over 2.2 million Americans and growing. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a self-terminating form of the cardiac arrhythmia that comprises between 25% and 60% of AF cases. PAF may be a single episode or clusters of abnormal rhythms with variable duration. PAF is often asymptomatic, and in those patients with symptoms, it has been estimated that for every symptomatic episode there are 10 asymptomatic ones. The self-terminating nature of PAF leads to its frequent under-diagnosis and consequent lack of use of established stroke prevention therapies. The proposed informatics screening tool ties clinical data collected in the home directly to the clinician; is completely unobtrusive and does not require surgical implantation. This system could identify even brief (5 minute) episodes of atrial fibrillation and prevent significant morbidity and mortality by identifying individuals wo would benefit from therapy, such as anticoagulation that significantly reduces stroke risk. The innovation of this project is a practical solution for providing such screening. A prototype devicewill be developed and evaluated in phase 1. The device will enable a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in the US population.',\n",
       " 'Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged in the Americas with local transmission identified in 30 countries and territories as of April 2016, including Brazil. Most persons (80%) with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic and ZIKV may be sexually transmitted, placing individuals who may not have travelled at risk. Maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV has also been documented. In April 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that fetal infection with ZIKV was the cause of microcephaly and other severe brain anomalies that result in permanent morbidity in surviving infants. Many questions remain regarding ZIKV infection, including the duration and potential for sexual or perinatal transmission of ZIKV from body fluids; the short and long-term reproductive outcomes of individuals infected with ZIKV; and the outcomes for infants born to men and women with either symptomatic or asymptomatic ZIKV infection. The University of Utah partnered with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to prepare for the 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled to occur in Brazil, the epicenter of the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas. The partnership focuses on understanding the dynamics of ZIKV infection in order to better protect the health of athletes and staff who will participate in the 2016 Games. This partnership also offers an exceptional opportunity for research that has the potential to answer many of the important research questions identified by the FOA PAR-16-106 “Rapid Assessment of ZIKV Complications (R21).” The proposed USOC cohort is unique in that it includes men and women in their reproductive years who are interested in conceiving after the Games. Their ongoing relationship with the USOC offers an opportunity for longitudinal study that will be of enormous benefit to the Americas, including the US, and to other geographic areas facing the emergence of ZIKV.

       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for developing chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Despite intense research, the mechanisms that underlie the pathways to renal hypoxia and CKD remain poorly under- stood. That difﬁculty may be attributable to the complex interplay among the millions of renal tubules and vessels that forms the basis for the integrative function of the kidney but that remains to be fully characterized. We have previously developed computational models of the rat kidney that represent the complex interactions, and we aim to extend those models and to conduct simulations that will provide insights into the kidney in health and disease. The proposed project includes (I) To develop a detailed and multiscale computational model of integrative rat kidney function, and to use that model to examine key determinants of kidney function and medullary oxygenation. Simulations of functional knockout and nephron loss will be conducted to determine: What are the necessary nephron structures and functions that must be preserved or should be inhibited to maintain or increase oxygen balance in the vulnerable outer medulla, while maintaining overall key kidney functions? (II) To simulate and gain insights into the pathophysiology and therapeutics of renal hypoxia in hypertension and diabetes. Hypertension and diabetes induce unique effects on the tubular system that increases kidney oxygen consumption. Model simulations will be conducted to investigate factors that impact intrarenal oxygen tension (PO2), particularly in the vulnerable outer medulla, including hypertension-induced shift in Na+ transport to the more distal and less efﬁcient nephron segments, elevated oxidative stress, diabetes-induced hyperﬁltration and tubular hypertrophy and hyper-reabsorption. We will simulate and investigate the effectiveness of current and novel therapeutic treatments and seek to answer questions like: How can one increase Na+ excretion in hypertension while limiting effects on other kidney functions and preserve medullary oxygenation? In diabetes, what is the inﬂuence of inhibiting Na+-glucose cotransport on renal NaCl transport and O2 requirement? To what extent do pressure reduction maneuvers increase medullary PO2 and protect the kidney? (III) To conduct experimental studies to assess the renal effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition. Inhibiting glucose reabsorption along the proximal tubule via SGLT2 is a novel approach for lower blood glucose level in diabetes. We will perform experiments on mice to determine: Does SGLT2 inhibition enhance Na+ transport of vulnerable downstream nephron segments and increase outer medullary hypoxia? Is there any beneﬁt in the additional inhibition of SGLT1 along the late proximal tubule, which limits Na+glucose reabsorption along that segment, but may further increase thick ascending limb Na+ transport? Does SGLT inhibition facilitate ischemia- reperfusion injury or impair the recovery? At the completion of these studies, we would have gained new insights into the key determinants of kidney function and medullary oxygenation in the normal kidney, and determined their potential relevance in the pathways from hypertension and diabetes to CKD.',\n",

In 2014, cryptococcal meningitis was responsible for approximately 15% of deaths in HIV treatment programs in Africa. Many of these deaths are preventable. Furthermore, the aggressive roll-out of ART in Sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in only slight decreases in cryptococcal meningitis incidence, e.g. 10-15% per South African national surveillance. In Uganda among hospitalized patients with suspected meningitis in 2014, Cryptococcus still remains more common than all other causes of meningitis combined.  One strategy to prevent the early mortality in ART programs is to screen for sub-clinical cryptococcal infection among asymptomatic persons living with AIDS using a simple blood test (cryptococcal antigen or CrAg). The prevalence of this detectable sub-clinical cryptococcal infection averages 7.2% (95%CI: 6.8-7.6%) among 36 African cohorts with CD4<100 not receiving ART. If identified, these asymptomatic CrAg+ persons can be given  preemptive  fluconazole antifungal therapy to prevent the development of meningitis or death. Our stepped- wedge randomized  ORCAS  trial demonstrated that pre-ART CrAg screening among HIV- infected persons with CD4<100 cells/mcL led to a 30% relative reduction in overall 6-month mortality within 18 clinics in Uganda. A similar ~30% benefit was seen in a separate randomized clinical trial in Tanzania and Zambia. However, while the CrAg screening intervention was successful, the survival of CrAg+ persons was 2-fold worse than CrAg-negative persons in both trials. Based on our team's prior research, Uganda and multiple other countries have incorporated pre-ART CrAg screening of persons with CD4<100 into National HIV Guidelines.  Therefore, further improvements in CrAg screening and preemptive therapy regimens are needed in order to reduce early ART mortality. First, we will evaluate in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial if 6-month cryptococcal-free survival of CrAg+ persons can be improved with enhanced preemptive antifungal therapy using adjunctive sertraline compared with the current WHO recommended preemptive CrAg+ therapy. Second, we will identify risk factors for failure of preemptive CrAg+ therapy with respect to 6-month cryptococcal-free survival. Overall we seek to innovate the delivery of HIV care to reduce early mortality on ART through implementation of an improved package of care for late presenters to care.\",\n",
       " 'The Adult Children Study (ACS) is an ongoing evaluation of middle to older adults at risk for development ofAlzheimer disease (AD). In Project 4 of the ACS, we use a combination of advanced imaging techniques toexplore the earliest signs of AD pathology. Using positron emission tomography (PET) we test for amyloidprotein deposits in the brain, which can be present up to 20 years before dementia symptoms are present. Wewill do this using florbetapir F18, which is a test for amyloid which has approval by the Federal Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we evaluate the functional changes in thebrain associated with the transition from the asymptomatic (preclinical) stages of AD into the symptomaticstage of AD dementia. We also use MRI to evaluate the brain’s structure, looking at grey matter atrophy withvolumetric MRI, and investigate the changes in white matter using a new technique, diffusion basis spectrumimaging (DBSI). In collaboration with Project 4, in Aim 1, we will generate unique brain maps for each imagingtest, in each stage of AD, as people move from an asymptomatic state into AD dementia. In Aim 2, we willthen examine these maps in relation to one another, to develop an integrated timeline for the imaging changeswhich occur during the transition from asymptomatic and symptomatic AD. We will then use these maps as away to predict the stage of the disease in specific individuals – in other words, to predict how long it would bebefore someone developed dementia. This mapping and predictive information is critical for the developmentof new drugs for AD and for the appropriate design of clinical trials in the future.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social attachments play a central role in most, if not all, levels of human interaction, from parent-child attachment, fraternity and kinship, friendship and social affiliation, to enduring partnerships with mates. Social attachment behaviors are also clinically very relevant, as several devastating conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia often manifest with a dramatic collapse of inter-personal interactions. These fascinating behaviors have traditionally been resistant to genetic and neurobiological approaches because of the limitations imposed by working on primates. Mice, the only genetically tractable mammalian model to date, appear not to display adult social attachment behaviors. This proposal seeks to establish the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) as a model system to examine the deficits in social attachment behaviors that result from mutations in genes associated with psychiatric illnesses.  Prairie voles are small mouse-like rodents that display strong social attachment behaviors such that mates typically form an enduring pair bond. Pair bonding results in dramatic changes in other social behaviors. These findings suggest that voles engage in a rich repertoire of social attachment behaviors that bear a striking resemblance to many of the social behaviors observed in humans.  Pioneering work in the prairie vole has identified vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt), neuropeptides and hormones, as critical mediators of pair bonding. Strikingly, AVP and OXT signaling have also been implicated in social attachment type behaviors in humans. Given the deep evolutionary similarity between humans and other eutherian mammals, including prairie voles, these findings indicate that the genetics and neural control of social attachment may also be conserved between humans and prairie voles. Thus, findings in the prairie voles may directly inform our understanding of human attachment behaviors.  We therefore propose to model the social deficits that manifest in psychiatric illness in this ideal model system for social attachment behaviors by generating prairie voles bearing mutations in genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. While no single model system is likely to recapitulate the entire spectrum of complex symptoms that occur in human psychiatric illness, this model system will, for the first time, allowuse to understand the neurobiology underlying the profound social deficits in these disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia often result in marked social deficits, which manifest as significantly limited social supports and relationships, difficulty maintaining employment, and overall deficits in social skills. We propose 1) to generate prairie voles mutant for genes implicated in autism, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3), and schizophrenia, Disks large homolog 2 (DLG2), 2) examine the pattern of deficits in social attachment behaviors that result from the loss of function of these genes, and 3) determine the change in patterns of neuronal activation that correlate with deficits in attachment related behaviors.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYCoronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half ofthe individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calciumscoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in theasymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surroundingthe heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular riskstratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT forcoronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due tothe absence of robust, automated quantification methods. We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robustquantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods toefficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a newintegrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in twoexisting, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans,clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, laterevascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of SubclinicalAtherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) andthe St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims:1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms forautomated quantification of EAT measures;2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative toatherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiacevents in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study;3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors,coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of futurecardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk scoreexternally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort. This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively andaccurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are atincreased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal proposes to study the effect of surgical intervention to improve the natural history of degenerative rotator cuff tears by comparing disease progression risks following surgery to the defined risks of asymptomatic cuff tears we have established with longitudinal studies. Additionally, we will also focus on defining risk factors upon presentation of a painful cuff tear that may predict future symptomatic development in the contralateral shoulder. This renewal will better define the potential benefit ofearly surgical intervention. IIA) Specific Aim 1: To obtain long-term follow-up (minimum 8 years) of a cohort of asymptomatic rotator cuff tears in subjects aged 65 years or younger to define the risks of tear enlargement and factors related to pain development. The most clinically relevant subjects within our cohort are those that retain good potential for tendon healing with surgical intervention. Further monitoring of these subjects is needed to define the long-term risks of non-operative treatment. The debate for operative indications is most relevant for patients that retaingood healing potential with surgery and cannot be answered with only 5 years follow-up. The risks of tear deterioration without surgery must be determined through a period of time until healing is not likely because of patient age. IIB) Specific Aim 2: To assess the ability of rotatorcuff repair surgery to interrupt the natural progression of degenerative cuff disease. The ability of surgery to halt the natural progression of degenerative rotator cuff disease has not been characterized. Untreated full-thickness rotator cuff tears enlarge in 50% of subjects, short-term. Tear enlargement is associated with declining function and advancing muscle degeneration. The natural history for non-operatively treated rotator cuff tears is concerning, in the short-term for disease progression. Because younger age and smaller tear size have been established as good predictors of healing with surgery, many advocate early repair in this group. These potential benefits are only realized if the natural history for repaired tendons is superior. Prospectively defining the benefits of surgery in subjects with good healing potential compared to nonoperatively treated tears will better define the role of early surgery. IIC) Specific Aim 3: o determine factors predictive of contralateral symptomatic rotator cuff disease progression based on the clinical presentation of a symptomatic rotator cuff tear. Approximately 56% of subjects with a painful rotator cuff tear will have an asymptomatic tear in the contralateral shoulder. Analysis of features related to the painful shoulder that may be predictive of future pain in the asymptomatic shoulder has not been previously considered. The ability to define patient and tear-related factors in the painful shoulder that are predictive of disease progression in the asymptomatic side will identify higher risk patients. Defining these factors is fundamental for counseling patients with degenerative rotator cuff tears and provides a foundation for patient education and implementation of preventive treatment strategies.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this revision application (competing supplement) is to integrate the assessment of brain tau deposition as a unique marker of  neurodegeneration  (ND). Our guiding concept is that isolated medial temporal tau (MT-tau) in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (i.e., Braak stages I-III) is more a factor of aging than Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but neocortical tau (NC-tau; Braak IV-VI) is typically amyloid-beta (Aβ)-dependent and part of the AD pathophysiological process and is thus a marker of ND. The central goal of the project as a whole remains further understanding the association of asymptomatic Aβ deposition and ND markers (NC-tau, hippocampal volume and cerebral metabolism) with progression to clinical cognitive impairment - as Aβ deposition alone cannot fully explain cognitive variability. In addition to the Aβ and ND markers we currently collect using Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET), structural MRI and [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, in this revision, we now propose to collect [F-18]AV-1451 (formerly T807) PET data on tau deposition to more fully understand the biomarker correlates of cognitive decline. Our cohort has now matured to the point that the occurrence of incident MCI and incident Aβ-positivity [incident-Aβ(+)] is sufficient to address other hypothese that could not be properly addressed until sufficient follow-up was in place - as is the case now. One critical hypothesis that we can now test is that Aβ(+) cognitively normal older adults are at high risk to develop clinically-significant cognitive impairment (i.e., MCI) (Aim 1). In addition, ur growing cohort of incident-Aβ(+) subjects allows us to observe the transition from being Aβ-negative to the earliest Aβ-positive [Aβ(+)] state (Aim 2.2). Also, our longitudinal fMRI data inincident-Aβ(+) individuals will allow us to test for the first time the assumption that higher functional activity/connectivity in Aβ(+) individuals reflects a true increase from baseline, and ot a maintenance of lifelong high activity/connectivity and will aid us in predicting when Aβ(+) individuals will develop cognitive decline (Aim 3). Finally, we propose to enhance our cohort to more effectively address the relationship between Aβ deposition and cognition by broadening the cognitive range of our cohort (Aim 2.1). We will interpret all of these data in the context of neurodegeneration markers (tau PET, atrophy and hypometabolism) as well as Aβ PET. The overall impact and significance of this study will be to further our understanding of: 1) the incidence of asymptomatic Aβand tau deposition; 2) the relationships between early Aβ and tau deposition and other neurodegeneration markers, functional activity/connectivity and cognition; and ultimately, 3) the relationship of asymptomatic Aβ and tau deposition and clinical MCI (and the timing of that association). Innovative aspects of this project include: 1) the study of incidet MCI in Aβ(+) individuals; 2) the study of incident-Aβ(+) cases; 3) the longitudinal study of the natural history of functional activity/connectivity in incident-Aβ(+) individuals and its relationhip to progression to MCI; and 4) the integration of tau PET.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is generally asymptomatic at early stages of the disease. Current state of the art screening tools such as mammography and breast examination miss early breast cancers due to the absence of mass lesions, are ineffective in detecting cancer in young women, and require invasive biopsy. New methods are needed to complement current methods for the detection and prognosis of precancerous and cancerous breast lesions while they are small and more easily treated. The analysis of the secreted glycoantigens, protein antigens and non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) in nipple aspirate fluid represents a very promising approach able to detect cancer-related biomarkers directly in body fluids mirroring the breast tissue-specific tumor microenvironment. Our long term goal is to develop a simple, sensitive and robust detection platform for diagnosing diseases at an asymptomatic early stage. Our diagnostic platform is based on the elegant and elaborate protein channel of a biological motor. We have inserted the motor channel into a lipid bilayer and the resulting system exhibits robust properties and generates extremely sensitive, stable and reproducible conductance signatures when analytes interact with the channel. We further demonstrated its utility as a highly sensitive device for detection of cancer-associated proteins i presence of many contaminants at single molecule level. The short-term goal of this proposal is to develop this motor channel as a nanopore for high-throughput single molecule detection of glyco-antigen, protein antigen and miRNA biomarkers extracted from breast cancer patient nipple aspirate fluid. The platform consists of: a membrane-embedded motor channel serving as a highly sensitive nanopore; programmable probes for capturing breast cancer associated antigens; and ultra-sensitive electrophysiological setup for multiplexed high-throughput single molecule detection. Incorporating our device into routine practice will enable physicians to monitor cellular changes within breast ducts earlier, before they develop into larger, potentially cancerous lesions.',\n",

Many of these deaths are preventable. Despite the aggressive roll out of ART in South Africa, the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis has only slightly decreased by 10- 15% per the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) national surveillance. Cryptococcus remains the most common cause of meningitis among adults in South Africa.  Recent research has shown that routine screening for sub-clinical early infection among asymptomatic patients presenting to ART programs using a simple blood test (cryptococcal antigen or CRAG) can identify which patients are at high risk of developing meningitis or death. The prevalence of this detectable sub-clinical cryptococcal infection is 4.1% among South Africans with CD4<100. If identified, these asymptomatic persons can be given  preemptive  anti-fungal fluconazole therapy to prevent meningitis and/or death. Our research collaboration has demonstrated that such a screening strategy would be highly cost-effective, at an estimated 1:160 will improve 6-month survival and decrease the current 25% failure rate (i.e. meningitis or death) with current WHO recommended CrAg+ preemptive therapy (Aim 3).',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION:  Almost a million people are ill from malaria each day while severe malaria disease claims the lives of 600,000 people each year. A rugged, portable sensitive and accurate method to diagnose malaria without blood sampling and using the reagents would be ideal and addresses the critical problem of malaria diagnosis in field or in asymptomatic cases. The MalariSense technology is able to make a diagnosis through the skin within seconds without using reagents or a needle to obtain blood. The device works by shining a short safe laser pulse that penetrates the skin to small blood vessels. The malaria parasite has a crystal inside of itsel that is able to absorb the laser energy to make a small vapor nanobubble that expands and collapses. The collapsing vapor nanobubble generates a pressure wave that is able to be detected by an ultrasound detector. Uninfected red blood cells are not affected by the laser and do not make a vapor bubble. The proof of MalariSense concept was demonstrated in animals and humans by shining a laser on the ear and detecting the sound pings. In this project, the discovered mechanism will be translated into a field, easy-to-use diagnostic device to non- invasively detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections in seconds, and to screen > 200,000 people per year with a single device with a diagnosis cost below 0.1$. This will be achieved through several connected activities: (1) Determine the methodology and specifications for the MalariSense technology; (2) Develop and prototype the MalariSense technology for field use; (3) Evaluate the MalariSense technology in endemic area, determine its performance and applications, and develop the platform for a global screening of malaria. The applications for analyzing mosquitoes, blood samples and small animals will also be developed and tested the ability to make the sensitive diagnosis of malaria through the skin opens up a whole new dimension to malaria diagnosis. The impact and applications are many. The ability to diagnose and treat asymptomatic people living in malaria areas will help greatly the strategies to eliminate malaria from regions. Another dimension of the device is the ability to enable the immediate global access and analysis of the raw data for the remote monitoring of malaria infection. The developed software, protocol and device will act as a platform for the future implementation of the global malaria diagnostic system to radically improve the malaria control and elimination in multiple settings. Just 1000 units will annually screen 200 million people to cover all current disease cases.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYAscertainment of kindreds with familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) has proven to be a valuable resource forstudying genetic susceptibility and underlying mechanisms that promote interstitial lung disease. Studies ofFIP kindreds during the current funding period have led to several important findings, including the observationthat rare variants (RVs) in a variety of genes can predispose to FIP. Based on whole exome sequencing(WES) from FIP patients during the current funding cycle, we have identified novel RVs in several genes thatwe believe are causative in FIP, including the telomerase pathway genes DKC1 and RTEL1, a G protein-coupled receptor GPR87, a centromere gene CENPN, and a gene of unknown function SYDE1. Preliminarystudies to examine the functional importance of RVs in these genes have linked RTEL1 and GPR87 to the p53pathway, suggesting that this pathway may integrate at least a portion of our genetic findings. To identifyadditional gene candidates, we used an unbiased approach to uncover pathways that were over-representedin the set of candidate RV-containing genes implicated by WES. Using this approach, two interrelatedpathways containing microtubule/cilia genes and centrosome genes were found to be markedly over-represented. Together, our preliminary data point to a defined set of interacting pathways that show promisefor containing RVs that predispose to FIP. The primary goal of this project during the current funding periodwas to identify, enroll, and phenotype members of families at risk for developing FIP. To date, we haveenrolled 372 asymptomatic first-degree relatives of FIP patients in this ongoing cohort study and obtainedblood samples and high resolution CT (HRCT) scans, as well as 100 bronchoscopies. In addition, through ourongoing collaboration with Dr. Schwartz (PI of Project 3), we have recently enrolled another 503 individuals atrisk for FIP in this ongoing cohort study. Together, this cohort of 875 asymptomatic individuals provides apowerful resource to identify the earliest manifestations of FIP, better define the natural history of FIP, anddetermine endophenotypes based on genetic predisposition. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize thatdamaging rare genetic variants in several inter-related pathways (including telomere genes,microtubule/cilia/centrosome genes, and p53-related genes) predispose to FIP through a common mechanismrelated to altered cell survival/proliferation. Specific aims are designed to: 1) evaluate genes with candidaterare genetic variants identified in FIP families and prioritize them for functional studies, 2) perform functionalanalysis of candidate rare genetic variants in targeted pathways, and 3) characterize genotype-phenotyperelationships in individuals at risk for FIP. By validating and testing the function of new disease-associatedalleles and using this information to determine genotype-phenotype relationships in individuals enrolled in ourongoing cohort study, these proposed studies provide an unprecedented opportunity to define the impact ofgenetic predisposition on key aspects of interstitial lung disease pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTHypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the one of leading causes of neurodevelopmental morbidities in preterm and full terminfants. The only therapeutic strategy to treat HI encephalopathy (HIE) is hypothermia in full term infants,which is only partially protective, and treatment does not exist for HI exposed preterm infants except forsupportive care. Based upon the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria, sufficientdose-response and therapeutic time windows, adequate histological and behavioral outcomes, andunderstanding mechanism(s) of action for neuroprotectants are necessary for preclinical drug development tofacilitate translation of neuroprotective strategies from animals to humans. The basis of this proposal is theidentification of novel immunomodulatory proteins, Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIPs) that are currently indevelopment as effective therapeutic agents in systemic inflammation/shock syndromes. IAIPs are novel anti-inflammatory molecules that broadly inhibit destructive serine proteases, robustly block pro-inflammatorycytokines, augment anti-inflammatory cytokine production, and block complement activation during systemicinflammation. Our exciting preliminary studies using blood derived IAIPs suggest IAIPs have remarkableneuroprotective properties in HI-neonatal rats. However, information regarding mechanism(s) for theneuroprotective efficacy of IAIPs and their brain penetration in HI-brain injury in neonates has not beenpreviously elucidated. The purpose of this proposal is to fill these gaps of knowledge: (1) To determine theoptimal dose-response and therapeutic time windows for IAIPs in neonatal rats; (2) To assess short/long termneurobehavioral outcomes, and establish the optimal neuroprotective efficacies for IAIPs administration inneonates; (3) To examine operative and molecular mechanism(s) of IAIPs as related to inflammation, celldeath, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, glial cellular responses, and penetration IAIPs into brain after HIbrain injury. The well-characterized Rice-Vannucci neonatal HI model will be used. The neuroprotectiveefficacy with various doses and time windows of IAIPs treatment will be determined by comparing braininjury/neuronal death (Luxol fast blue/H&E and DNA fragmentation). Mechanism(s) of action will be examinedby determining inflammation (pro-inflammatory cytokine production/neutrophil brain infiltration), apoptosis, BBBpermeability, IAIP brain penetration (125I-labeled IAIPs), glial cell responses (astrogliosis, microglia activation,and oligodendrocyte injury), and possible side effects on clotting/fibrinolysis cascades. Short/long-termbehavioral outcomes will be determined at different stages of brain development. The current proposal willestablish drug efficacy, optimal dose-responses and time windows, during which IAIPs attenuate HI brain injurywith reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal/glial cell death, and BBB damage, and improve short/long termbehavioral performance in neonatal HI rats. Results should yield novel preclinical information to accelerateIAIPs use as neuroprotective agents to treat HI-related brain injury in human premature and full term infants.',\n",

This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying therelationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such asamyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitivelyhealthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date andhelp elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk forAD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued”representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real butstatistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process.Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects withamyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representationsof the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyseson a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology willa) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) providepreclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individualsubjects.Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations ofmorphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers,and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical ADcohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retestvalidation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationshipof the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry-strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing softwaretoolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud.Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research:1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in theearliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging andneuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community.\",\n",
       " \"Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is a type of tumor caused by the human herpesvirus 8 that often develops in AIDS patients with weakened immune systems. In the case of AIDS-related KS, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can induce significant regression of the disease; however, HAART is not always effective and second-line therapies for KS include chemotherapeutic intervention. Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are frequently used in the treatment of AIDS-related KS but resistance to these agents does arise. Taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel have successfully been used to treat doxorubicin-resistant KS. However, no studies have examined the potential resistance mechanisms to taxanes in KS. As HAART is often administered concomitantly with chemotherapy when treating AIDS-related KS, it is important to examine the effects of recently-approved antivirals on potential resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy used to treat KS. Our interest in resistance mechanisms in Kaposi's sarcoma comes from our previous work with the ATP-dependent transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We previously demonstrated that P-gp can hamper HIV virus production and decrease infectivity in cells that overexpress the transporter. Additionally, a number of HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to be substrates of P-gp. In a cell line model of Kaposi's sarcoma, we found that anthracycline treatment leads to increased P-gp expression and that HIV protease inhibitors can further augment this expression. However, the cell line used for this study was recently shown to be mischaracterized, thus requiring a reevaluation of these results. Our current work focuses on the L1T2 cell line that has been shown to recapitulate clinical features of Kaposi's sarcoma in mouse models. We have characterized the drug resistance pattern of this cell line and are isolating resistant sublines of the L1T2 line to identify potential mechanisms of resistance using a Taq-man low-density array microfluidic chip to detect mRNA expression of 380 drug resistance-related genes comprising genes involved in drug efflux, DNA repair mechanisms, apoptosis and metabolizing enzymes. Additionally, these results will allow us to characterize the role that HIV protease inhibitors play in inducing or preventing resistance to chemotherapy. Ultimately we hope that identification of novel mechanisms of resistance in Kaposi's sarcoma will lead to improved therapies.\",\n",

       " 'We have previously provided conclusive evidence that the invertebrate stages of Leishmania are fully capable of a sexual cycle during their growth and development in the sand fly vector. Our experimental mating attempts demonstrated mating compatibilities both within and between Leishmania species.   Altogether, the outcrosses generated experimentally support the conclusion that the accumulating examples of hybrid genotypes observed in natural populations have likely arisen by genetic exchange. In addition to outcrosses, we have studied the self-mating competency in Leishmania, and have analyzed 26 self-mating progeny clones by whole genome sequencing and virulence phenotyping in mice.  Results indicate that  intraclonal mating is possible and can generate phenotypic diversity that is associated with a high frequency of genomic modifications, both polyploidy and aneuploidy.    Since opportunities for outcrossing in the sand fly vector may be rare, self-mating may be the more important reproductive strategy underlying the remarkable diversity of the genus. Leishmania parasites have a dimorphic life cycle, shifting between the alimentary tract of their sand fly vector as extracellular, flagellated promastigotes, and the phagolysosomal vacuoles of their mammalian host cell macrophages as intracellular amastigotes.  The ability of the parasite to adapt to these radically different environments has been the focus of a number of studies comparing the transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes of amastigotes and promastigotes during their  transformation in vitro.   There are a multitude of conditions in the vector, and a number of distinct promastigote developmental stages, that are likely adapted to microenvironments in the fly that are absent when Leishmania are axenically grown in vitro.  We used RNA-sequencing to profile for the first time the transcriptomes of L. major during its transition from amastigotes to procyclic promastigotes in the sand fly midgut, and during its subsequent development in vivo as nectomonad promastigotes, and finally its differentiation to the infective, metacyclic promastigote stage.   The biggest change in the mRNA profiles occurred in the first two days after the infective feed when the parasite transformed from amastigotes to procyclic promastigotes, with a total of 1212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs).  Of the top 25 mRNAs that are down regulated as the parasites differentiate into procyclic promastigotes, the majority were the genes encoding the amastin surface proteins, extracellular proteases, and ABC transporters.  mRNAs that are associated with sugar transport and metabolism were significantly up-regulated with the transition from amastigotes to procyclic promastigotes, while other sources of energy such as amino acids and ketone bodies were taken up and/or metabolized in the later developmental forms.  Comparisons between the different in vivo promastigote developmental stages revealed that each stage expressed a number of unique surface proteins.  The results also showed down regulation in nucleosome assembly and cell replication related genes at the nectomonad stage, with translation increasing again during metacyclogenesis and remaining elevated in amastigotes.  Different stress responses were highly upregulated in the metacyclic stage.  Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is endemic in the northeast Indian state of Bihar, is thought to have an anthroponotic transmission cycle as no mammalian host other than humans has ever been shown to harbor the etiologic agent, Leishmania donovani.  However, which infected humans act as important reservoirs for transmission of L. donovani to the sand fly vector, Phlebotomus argentipes, remains unknown.  The possibilities include active VL cases, clinically cured cases, patients with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), and infected but asymptomatic individuals.  As asymptomatic infections are far more frequent than those progressing to disease, it is especially important to determine the reservoir potential of asymptomatic cases.  The problem is being addressed using two approaches:  1) The application of forensic DNA methods to identify the human source of an infected blood meal, and 2)  xenodiagnostic studies of well-defined subject groups using live vector sand flies.  Our findings established the feasibility of the forensic DNA method to directly trace the human source of an infected blood meal, with constraints imposed by the requirement that the flies be recovered for analysis within 24 hours of their infective feed.  We found that the ability to obtain readable human DNA fingerprints from sand flies depended entirely on the size of the blood meal and the kinetics of its digestion.  For the xenodiagnosis studies, the preparatory phase required two years to build an insectary, establish a robust, closed colony of P. argentipes from wild stock collected from the VL endemic zone in Bihar, and finally to certify the colony as Leishmania and phleovirus free for feeding on human volunteers.  This work was completed in April, 2016 and the xenodiagnostic studies initiated in July, 2016.  These studies will continue with accrual of over 100 volunteers from each exposure group during the next two years.   We have also performed xenodiagnostic studies at the NIH using the hamster model of VL that reproduces the progressive form of human disease, to study the transmission dynamics of L. donovani to a colonized vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis.  The transmission from the sick hamsters to the flies after the first feeding was unexpectedly low, with an average of only 16% of the blood fed flies acquiring infection.  By contrast, there was a strong increase in L. donovani transmissibility after multiple exposures to sand fly bites (47%) that was due to a higher blood parasitemia, suggesting that there is a systemic response to sand fly bites in the host that promotes release of infected cells into the peripheral blood and that is exploited by the parasite to favor its transmissibility.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kineta has discovered a novel class of broad spectrum small molecule antivirals that function through a host directed mechanism. These compounds have demonstrated an innovative mechanism of action and target several high priority pathogens that are commercially valuable. The lead chromenone-based candidates have potency in the nM range, inhibit multiple viruses including influenza, coronavirus, West Nile, ebola, and dengue virus in vitro and in animal models, have an attractive pharmacologic profile, and are well tolerated in vivo. In this application, we will perform lead optimization andpreclinical development of the lead series. The major milestone of the project is to select one or more nominated drug candidates for formal IND-enabling development towards an oral therapeutic for broad respiratory viral infections. Drug treatment to stimulate the host innate immune response is increasingly appreciated as a strategy for therapeutic intervention and has the potential to redefine the paradigm of antiviral drug development. The need for effective antivirals is great, and our approach to stimulate innate immunity in the presence of diverse viralcountermeasures has yielded promising leads that are effective against a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses. We have assembled a highly qualified development team that includes the Kineta scientists responsible for the antiviral discovery work and Prof Michael Gale, Jr. of the University of Washington, an expert in innate immunity and the antiviral response.',\n",
       " \"Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most important public health issues our society is facing today.An estimated 5 million people age 65 and older in the United States (US) are currently living with AD, and thisnumber may nearly triple by 2050. To address this impeding population burden, the National Alzheimer's ProjectAct (NAPA) 2015 report emphasized the need for identifying preventive strategies that can delay symptomaticdisease onset. While much emphasis has been placed on developing and testing effective disease-modifyingstrategies targeting this asymptomatic preclinical phase of AD (pAD), little emphasis has been placed oncurrently available strategies that target cognitive reserve, resulting in (1) delaying symptom onset, (2) shorteningthe overall course of symptomatic disease, and (3) substantially reducing the financial and societal impact of AD.We hypothesize that targeted reductions in inappropriate medication use (Beers Criteria 2015), will bolstercognitive reserve in subjects at risk for AD, delaying the onset of clinical symptoms, and reducing the prevalenceand duration of symptomatic disease. The impact of this strategy, if successful, includes a dramatic reduction inoverall health care expenditures for the millions affected by AD by delaying the symptomatic phase of diseasein accord with NAPA aims. Our specific aims are:Specific Aim 1. Conduct a 12-month, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the impact of our patient-centered, pharmacist-physician team MTM intervention in reducing unnecessary and inappropriate medicationuse in community-dwelling, elderly, non-demented subjects. Primary outcome measures will include pre- to post-intervention measures of: (1) use of inappropriate medications as measured by the Medication AppropriatenessIndex (MAI); 2) Cognitive Reserve Change Score (CRCS) defined as the difference in the scopolamine-challenged vs unchallenged measures on the neurocognitive score.Specific Aim 2 Evaluate the impact of preclinical amyloid burden on cognitive reserve deficits and decline(measured as CRCS) to evaluate efficacy of delaying symptomatic disease progression in pAD.While not eliminating AD or shortening duration of biological disease, the delay in symptom onset andprogression to functional decline resulting from reduction in inappropriate medication use could lessen ADprevalence and significantly reduce healthcare expenditures related to not only AD, but potentially all forms ofdementia involving a prodromal asymptomatic period. Study results would enable the larger implementation ofsimilar medication management strategies in clinical practice to address the need for multifaceted preventivestrategies to maintain cognitive health in the aging population.\",\n",
       " 'For the past 15 years, we have studied cognitive changes in patients treated for carotidartery stenosis by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery angioplasty and stenting(CAS). Using neurocognitive tests, we have defined post-operative cognitive dysfunction (CD), asubtle measure of cerebral injury. Post-operative cognitive dysfunction is part of a continuum ofinjury to the brain. Early cognitive dysfunction (eCD) is observed in ~ 25% of patients within 1day of CEA, and less so 30 days after CEA (delayed CD [dCD]). Over the last 10 years of ourNIH grant (RO1 AG17604), we have demonstrated that 1. Asymptomatic patients takingstatinspre-operatively exhibit significantly less eCD than those not taking statins, 2. Simvastatinis associated with significantly less eCD than atorvastatin, 3. Statins are also neuroprotectiveagainst eCD in CAS patients, 4.Patients with eCD and not taking statins have significantlyhigher risk of mortality than those with eCD taking statins, 5. Pro-inflammatory polymorphismsand marker concentrations are significantly associated with increased eCD, and 6. Statins areassociated with lower levels of pro-inflammatory markers. Based on these findings, wehypothesize that in asymptomatic patients undergoing CEA, 1. Pre-operative statin use isneuroprotective against eCD and lowers the risk of early mortality, 2. Statin type and dose maybe important in achieving optimal neuroprotection, and 3. The anti-inflammatory effects ofstatins may partially account for the observed neuroprotection. To address these hypotheses,we will prospectively evaluate 1000 asymptomatic patients with a neurocognitive battery foreCD and dCD before and after CEA in a multi-center randomized trial. Lipid profiles andmarkers of systemic inflammation will be obtained before and after statin therapy. Patients willbe randomized into one of three arms for 2 weeks pre-operatively and 4 weeks-post operativelydepending on their statin status upon enrollment. Arms: 1. Patients on optimal daily doses ofeither simvastatin (40mg), atorvastatin (80mg) or rosuvastatin (20mg) will be tested andobserved, 2. Patients on one of the three statins at less than optimal dosage (simvastatin<40mg, atorvastatin <80mg or rosuvastatin <20mg) will be randomized to receive an optimaldose or remain at their suboptimal dosage using re-encapsulated blinded medication, and 3.Patients who are not already taking statins, will be randomized to a daily dose ofreencapsulatedblinded atorvastatin 10mg (suboptimal) or atorvastatin 80mg (optimal). Overall, we expect that high-dose simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin will beneuroprotectiveagainst eCD and dCD. We think that statin neuroprotection occurs because ofanti-inflammatory mechanisms and will be reflected in reduced levels of systemic inflammatorymarkers. The findings of this prospective randomized trial will provide important data forclinicians attempting to make this common procedure safer, and will elucidate whether statinsare neuroprotective in human ischemic cerebral injury. Our results may guide the developmentof these agents for other indications.',\n",
       " \"Exchange of genes is an important evolutionary process that occurs at high frequency within microbial populations, allowing them to adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions. Acquisition of resistance to antibiotics in bacteria is one of the many ways in which such gene swapping impacts society. Because of the potentially tremendous benefit to their survival, bacteria have developed a large arsenal of mechanisms for gene trade. One enigmatic gene exchange mechanism involves shuttling genes packaged in particles (so-called Gene Transfer Agents) that resemble bacterial viruses. This raises many questions about the origin and functionality of this mechanism. How beneficial is it to exchange genes this way? Do Gene Transfer Agents represent former viruses that were  domesticated  by bacteria?  Bacterial viruses are numerically the most abundant organisms on Earth. Could many of these viruses in fact be Gene Transfer Agents? Answers to these questions will advance our understanding of how gene exchange contributes to bacterial adaptation. Because of accumulating evidence that Gene Transfer Agents are of use to a microbial population as a whole rather than to an individual cell, this project will also advance our knowledge on the origin and maintenance of cooperation, a long-standing mystery of evolutionary biology. Since bacteria and viruses are key players in all Earth environments, including human bodies, the project will benefit both the scientific community and broader society. Researchers at Dartmouth College will investigate the above questions via computational analyses of genetic information from marine bacteria. Those bacteria are key players in Earth's nutrient cycling and ocean habitability. Genes encoding Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) will be identified and extracted from bacterial genomes and oceanic metagenomes. These GTAs will then be rigorously compared to similar genes from bacterial viruses. The comparison will assess the GTA's evolutionary relationship to viruses and the selective pressure exerted on their genes by bacterial hosts.  Given the recent discovery of the GTA system and its resemblance to actual viruses, many true GTAs in available genomic sequences could be mistakenly annotated as integrated bacterial viruses. To address this important issue, the researchers will develop a novel bioinformatic method that aims to successfully distinguish Gene Transfer Agents from their viral counterparts. Ultimately, this cross-disciplinary project will contribute to better understanding of oceanic and global elemental cycles and of adaptive evolutionary processes that drive bacterial populations in marine and other environments. The data sets and computer programs generated in this project will be shared with scientific community.\",\n",

       " 'ABSTRACTMounting evidence suggests that autoantibodies can antecede overt clinical disease, with anti-SSA/Ro amongthe earliest reactivities. Yet, predicting who remains protected from overt disease or who will progress wouldbe a game-changing discovery for understanding the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).Mothers in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL) represent a unique population at risk for overtclinical autoimmunity. Despite the presence of high titer anti-Ro antibodies potentially pathogenic to thedeveloping fetus, many women are asymptomatic, with autoimmunity identified solely based on disease in theiroffspring. Currently, of 521 RRNL mothers, 283 were asymptomatic, or had only minimal symptoms, at the timeof the birth of the NL child, whereas a subset developed SLE. The intertwining of genetic variation in the HLAlocus with the capacity to undergo shifts toward a pathologic gut microbiome may, in part, explain progressionfrom benign to pathologic autoimmunity and overt SLE. Alternatively, other HLA variants may instead associatewith a protective microbiome that halts progression so that a state of benign autoimmunity persists. In SpecificAim 1, associations will be sought between host genetics and anti-Ro NL disease status. We will genotype anestimated 297 RRNL mothers using an HLA next generational sequencing approach that makes no a priorisequence assumptions. The HLA alleles will be informative to distinguish asymptomatic anti-Ro-mothers(particularly those remaining so for >6 years) from those who initially or quickly progressed to classified SLE. InSpecific Aim 2, associations will be sought between gut microbiome taxa in the context of HLA and anti-RoNL maternal disease status, as we address the hypothesis that HLA is a central driver of pathobiontassociations that contribute to the pathogenesis of overt SLE. A planned longitudinal analysis of theasymptomatic RRNL mothers will be highly informative and expected to capture women who transition toestablished SLE. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the relationships of serological and cellular immunity(and CD4 T-cell subsets) and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status. Newly generated data will be continuouslyshared and discussed with Drs. Silverman (Project 2) and Reizis (Project 3) to further explore associations inthe context of circulating and fecal IgA and anti-DNASE1L3 sensitive reactivity with microparticles. A molecularbasis for the specific microbial taxa that are coated with sIgA will be evaluated in context of a mimicryhypothesis that considers cross-reactivity between T cell epitopes and bacterial peptides. From a public healthperspective, it is anticipated that conserved patterns or blueprints will be identified for host immune systemsthat are best suited to arrest autoimmunity at a benign preclinical state or conversely that favor progression toovert SLE and tissue injury. Identification of one or more predictive biomarkers that associate with apersistently asymptomatic state could also serve as the “target to achieve” while a permissive factor mightrepresent a “target to inhibit” in an established SLE patient.',\n",
       " \"A major limiting factor in previous studies of both the asymptomatic and pathological knee is the inability to non-invasively measure three-dimensional skeletal and muscular motion simultaneously. Cine phase contrast (PC) MRI (dynamic MRI) is the only technique currently available that can do just this. Cine-PC MRI, which is a combination of cine and phase contrast MRI, provides a temporal series of anatomic images of all cyclically moving and static structures in the imaging plane.  Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to determine the specific sources of maltracking patterns in patellofemoral (PF) pain. As part of this overall goal, the purpose of this study is to determine how the loss of function in the vasti medialis muscle alters the dynamic control of patellar kinematics in healthy individuals, using cine-PC as the primary measurement tool.Twenty-three asymptomatic volunteers with no prior history of knee pain, trauma, leg surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI have been enrolled. During the first visit, the PF and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics were derived from dynamic cine phase contrast velocity data. If the first visit data revealed the presence of a valid exclusion criteria, the subject was removed from the study (n=5, based on the presence of abnormal PF kinemtics); if not, the subject was asked to return within a week for the second segment of the study. For the second visit, the same kinematics were acquired immediately after administering a motor branch block to the VM using 3-5cc of 1% lidocaine. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the null hypothesis that the post- and pre-injection kinematics were no different across the knee angles of extension. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality was run. If the data were normally distributed, a repeated measures ANOVA was run using Hotellings T2 test statistic; if not, the non-parametric Friedman's test statistic was used. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis a post-hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) was completed to determine at which knee angles the null hypothesis could be rejected. Pearsons correlations between the change in kinematics post-injection and the pre-injection kinematics were quantified at these same knee angles. This was followed by a step-wise linear regression. Significance was set at p0.05.Post-injection, the maximum lateral shift of the patellar and tibial origins (1.8mm, SD=1.7mm, p=0.003 KA=20 and 2.1mm, SD=2.9mm, p=0.02, KA = 15) and the maximum external tibial rotation (3.7, SD=4.4, p=0.006, KA=20) occurred at similar points in the extension arc. These changes were 3.2 to 4.8 times greater than the subject repeatability. The value of PF tilt trended laterally post-I (max=1.6, KA =15), but significant differences pre- to post-I were not found. No individual reported pain, based on a Visual Analog Scale, following the kinematic trials during visit 1 and visit 2. The lateral shift of the PF origin post-I was significantly correlated with the initial value of PF origins superior displacement in terminal extension (Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) ranged from 0.47 to 0.48 for knee angles ranging from 10-20, p<0.05). To relate the kinematic changes seen following a VM block to those seen in PFPS, it is important to understand that there are likely subgroups within the PFPS population, each with unique kinematic alterations of varying etiologies. In a previous study the PFPS cohort was divided into two groups, lateral and non-lateral maltrackers. The lateral maltrackers demonstrated increased PF lateral and superior shift, lateral tilt, flexion, and valgus rotation. The change in kinematics following the nerve block could account for a portion of the lateral shift and tilt seen in the lateral maltrackers. Increased ligament laxity likely would have increased this shift and tilt, as well as increased the patellar ligament length, resulting in the observed PF superior shift (patella alta) in the lateral maltrackers. Patella alta reduces the influence of the femoral groove on PF kinematics in terminal extension, resulting in increased PF lateral shift (as supported by the correlations within this study), lateral tilt, and valgus rotation. Therefore, a combination of VM weakness and generalized ligament laxity could account for the kinematic variations in the lateral maltracking group. These changes would result in higher contact stresses when the patella is forced to re-engage with the femoral sulcus in early flexion and would reduce the overall contact area, both of which would likely leading to PF pain. The non-lateral maltrackers demonstrated increases in PF flexion and TF internal rotation only, with a trend towards PF medial translation and medial tilt. A larger LTI combined with a normative PF superior location in the non-lateral maltrackers limited lateral PF shift and influenced patellar tilt in this subgroup. Thus, in this sub-group a loss of VM strength likely would have resulted in increased contact force between the lateral femoral sulcus and the patella, resulting in PF pain, without excessive lateral shift and tilt being present. The high LTI and the trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltracking group may help explain the variability in the post-I change in PF lateral tilt. In the presence of a high LTI, a loss of strength in the VMO strength could result in the lateral patellar edge riding up the lateral femoral sulcus, resulting in the observed trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltrackers and the post-I medial tilt observed in some subjects.The current study provides crucial data for validation of musculoskeletal modeling. Specifically, the estimation of the quadriceps ability to produce a torque on the tibia is complicated by the fact that the patella serves as an intermediary (a dynamic fulcrum) between the quadriceps and tibia. Therefore, the term effective quadriceps moment arm was coined to define the ability of the quadriceps to generate a torque on the tibia. Yet, this property has only been calculated two-dimensionally in the sagittal plane. The post-I external tibial rotation clearly demonstrates that acting through the patella, the VM effective moment arm has a component that results in internal tibial rotation. This study has advanced the clinical understanding of PFPS by providing a direct in vivo link between VMO weakness in isolation and knee joint kinematic alterations. In doing so it has demonstrated that VMO weakness is most likely a major factor in, but not the sole source of, PF maltracking. Thus, isolated VM strengthening will likely not fully correct PF maltracking in most individuals. In addition, it demonstrated that even with kinematic alterations in the PF and TF joint, pain was not experienced during the post-I trial, indicating that pain may be a factor that develops over time. Combining these findings with past results pertaining to the kinematics and bone shape alterations in individuals with PFPS supports two paths to PFPS in two kinematically unique subgroups. Such knowledge will likely help foster the next generation of treatments for PFPS that focus on first elucidating subject-specific factors leading to PF pain and then devising an intervention plan that specifically targets these factors in order to optimize treatment. Future work is required to provide further evidence on the validity of these paths and extend the current methodology to create a clinical diagnostic tool that will help guide therapeutic or surgical treatments for patients with PF pain.This work won the prestigious 2011 International Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award and the 2011 American Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award.Currently, the data from this study is being used as part of a cartilage contact analysis.\",\n",
       " 'Project SummaryWhooping cough, caused by Bordetella pertussis, is one of the most contagious of all contagious diseases,and the least well controlled of all vaccine preventable pediatric diseases. Since switching to acellularpertussis (aP) vaccines, incidence in the US and other countries that made this vaccine substitution, have seenincidence rates rise. Epidemiologic and experimental data suggest that a key limitation of aP vaccines is thatthey do not block asymptomatic carriage and spread. However, the existence of an asymptomatic carrier statefor B. pertussis has never been proven, but this is because the question has never before been asked in anappropriately designed, longitudinal, cohort study, with systematic sample and symptoms collection over time.In a previous birth cohort study, the Southern Africa Mother Infant Pertussis Study, we collected ~20,000nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 2000 Zambian mother/infant pairs, from birth through 14 weeks of age, withsymptoms catalogued in parallel. Preliminary analysis of this set suggests that pertussis is common amongthe infants. Moreover, nearly all of the mothers of the infected infants were also infected with pertussis, thoughfew showed any symptoms. This is presumptive evidence of asymptomatic carriage, but rests only on analysisof about 10% of the total sample library. We contend that full analysis of this sample library could provideinsight into the epidemiology and transmission patterns of B. pertussis in ways never before possible. Datafrom this proposed analysis of the library can answer fundamental questions about asymptomatic carriage, itsfrequency, and concurrence within the mother/infant pair, and will also be invaluable for updating mathematicalmodels of pertussis transmission, allowing us to answer, for the first time, what proportion of overall pertussistransmission occurs via asymptomatic chains?',\n",
       " 'Specific Aim 1. Retrograde transport of late endosomes regulates autophagy-lysosomal function essential for neuron survival (Cai et al., Neuron 2010; Xie et al., Neuron 2015; Cheng et al., JCB 2015). Dynein motors drive retrograde transport of late endosomes, thus enhancing their trafficking from distal processes to the soma, where mature lysosomes are mainly localized. Our recent study uncovered a critical role for snapin in regulating late endocytic transport and endo-lysosomal trafficking. Snapin acts as a dynein motor adaptor by attaching dynein to late endosomes. The snapin KO neurons exhibit impaired retrograde transport of late endosomes, reduced lysosomal proteolysis, aberrant accumulation of immature lysosomes, and impaired clearance capacity of autolysosomes. Snapin deficiency leads to axonal degeneration and developmental defects in the central nervous system. Reintroducing the snapin transgene rescues these phenotypes. Our studies elucidate a mechanism coordinating dynein-mediated late endocytic transport and lysosomal degradation capacity in neurons. Such a mechanism is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis essential for neuronal survival. Autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction is one of the cellular defects contributing to the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative diseases associated with accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins and damaged organelles. Specific Aim 2. Endo-lysosomal trafficking regulates presynaptic activity (Di Giovanni and Sheng, EMBO J 2015). Proper regulation of synaptic vesicle (SV) pool size is critical to maintain presynaptic activity. Because early endosomes represent crossroads between local SV recycling and endo-lysosomal degradation, this raises a fundamental question as whether SVs are sorted toward endo-lysosomal pathway for degradation. To address this, we applied snapin dominant-negative mutants combined with dual-channel time-lapse imaging in live cortical neurons. Our study reveals that dynein-driven late endosome transport regulates SV pool size. Expressing dynein-binding defective snapin mutants induced SV accumulation at presynaptic terminals, mimicking the snapin-/- phenotype. Conversely, over-expressing snapin reduced SV pool size by enhancing SV trafficking to the endo-lysosomal pathway. Therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the maintenance and regulation of SV pool size through endosomal trafficking and sorting.Specific Aim 3. Mechanism removing autophagosomes from distal axons (Cheng et al., JCB 2015). Degradation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) via lysosomes is an important homeostatic process over a neurons lifetime. Newly formed autophagosomes are fused with late endosomes into amphisomes, or fused with lysosomes into autolysosomes for degradation. However, it is unknown how autophagosomes generated in distal axons acquire their retrograde motility toward the soma for degradation. We reveal a new motor-adaptor sharing mechanism driving autophagosome transport to the soma. Endosome-loaded dynein-snapin complexes mediate retrograde transport of autophagosomes upon their fusion into amphisomes in distal axons. This motor sharing mechanism enables neurons to maintain effective autophagic clearance, thus reducing autophagic stress in axons. Therefore, our study reveals a new cellular pathway to remove distal AVs engulfing aggregated misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles associated with several major neurodegenerative diseases.Specific Aim 4. Autophagy-lysosomal deficits contributes to ALS-linked early pathology (Xie et al., Neuron 2015). One pathological hallmark in fALS-linked motor neurons (MNs) is axonal accumulation of AVs, thus raising a fundamental question as to whether reduced autophagic clearance contributes to autophagic stress and axonal degeneration. We recently reveal progressive lysosomal deficits in spinal MNs beginning at early asymptomatic stages in fALS-linked mice expressing the human mutant SOD1G93A protein. Such deficits impair the degradation of AVs engulfing damaged mitochondria from distal axons. These early pathological changes are attributable to mutant hSOD1, which interferes with dynein-driven endo-lysosomal trafficking. Elucidation of this pathological mechanism is broadly relevant, because autophagy-lysosomal deficits are associated with several major neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, enhancing lysosome function, rather than autophagy induction, is an alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS-linked clinical trials.Specific Aim 5. Synaptic cargo transport regulates synaptic maintenance and plasticity (Su et al., Nature Cell Biology 2004; Cai et al., Journal of Neuroscience 2007; Xiong et al., in preparation). The formation of new synapses and remodeling of existing synapses play an important role in the various forms of synaptic plasticity; this process requires the targeted delivery of newly synthesized synaptic cargoes from the soma to distal synapses. Our previous studies established that syntabulin is an adaptor capable of linking KIF5 motor and synaptic protein cargoes. Syntabulin-KIF5 coupling mediates axonal transport of synaptic components essential for presynaptic assembly and maintenance. Syntabulin loss-of-function impairs the assembly and maintenance of presynapses in developing neurons. Our recent study shows that syntabulin conditional KO mice display autism-like social interaction and impaired synaptic plasticity. Our studies establish that kinesin-mediated axonal transport is one mechanism underlying activity-dependent presynaptic plasticity.

       " 'Despite reductions in malaria cases across Latin America, malaria transmission hot spots remainheterogeneously distributed throughout Amazonia, virtually all of which are strongly linked to the primaryAmazonian vector Anopheles darlingi. Malaria transmission in Amazonia is associated with rapid adaptation byAn. darlingi to anthropogenically-driven environmental changes. This project will address three understudiedfacets of An. darlingi which will provide key details of how this vector maintains its dominant role in Amazonianmalaria transmission dynamics by: 1) delineating the importance of anthropic breeding sites that lead to highmosquito productivity and dispersal near human habitation; 2) examining rapid adaptation in modifiedlandscapes of both location (indoor/ outdoor) and nocturnal timing of biting behavior; and, 3) showing how thismosquito species’ preferences/ changes interact with Plasmodium vivax asymptomatic persons to maintainhypoendemic transmission. First, we will evaluate the contribution of artificial vs. natural ponds to malariatransmission. In villages/towns with varying annual parasitic indices in malaria endemic regions of Peru andBrazil, we will census breeding sites near malaria-associated houses and characterize their physicalparameters, and assess host availability in and around houses. We will identify where mosquitoes bite infectedindividuals by identifying patterns of mosquito movement, particularly by comparing larval genotypes inbreeding site types with adults from houses. We expect a strong correlation of larval density in proximity with“hot” (malarial) houses that experience the highest numbers of cases within village regardless of breeding sitetype. Second, based on our previous success in continuous laboratory propagation of An. darlingi in thePeruvian Amazon, we will colonize behaviorally distinctive (endophagic, exophagic) populations of An. darlingiand experimentally test each for vector competence using P. vivax and P. falciparum. We anticipate detectingtwo distinct populations, 1) wild, opportunistic mosquitoes in natural breeding sites, bloodseeking preferentiallyfrom ~6-9 PM outside houses; 2) anthropophilic mosquitoes that preferentially use artificial breeding sites,bloodseeking from ~3-6 AM inside houses. Third, we will quantify and compare the efficiency of P. vivaxinfection of An. darlingi under different, biologically-relevant conditions, using direct and standard membranefeeding assays. The following groups of subjects will be studied: symptomatic, microscopy positive;asymptomatic, microscopy positive; and asymptomatic, subpatent (microscopy negative, RT-PCR+), withasymptomatic, untreated subjects studied serially over short periods (diurnally over days) before treatment.These data will allow us to parameterize mathematical models of P. vivax transmission dynamics in quantifyingbiologically relevant factors such as fluctuations in parasitemia and gametocytemia over days and comparingcircadian cycles. We expect to find that asymptomatic parasitemic individuals are quantitatively importantreservoirs that maintain malaria transmission whether patent or subpatent.',\n",

Although there is good preliminary evidence from caseseries and physiological studies that hemodynamic impairment affects cognition in patients withcarotid occlusive disease, treatment of this condition has never been tested in a randomized clinicaltrial. We propose to conduct an ancillary study to the NINDS-sponsored CREST-2 trial, a pair ofoutcome-blinded, Phase 3 clinical trials for patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid arterystenosis which will compare carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) versusOMT alone (n=1,240), and carotid artery stenting plus OMT versus OMT alone (n=1,240) to preventstroke and death. . Our application addresses the intriguing question of whether cognitiveimpairment can be reversed when it arises from abnormal cerebral hemodynamic perfusion in ahemodynamically impaired subset of the CREST-2 –randomized patients. We will enroll 500patients from CREST-2, all of whom receive cognitive assessments at baseline and yearlythereafter. We will identify 100 patients with hemodynamic impairment as measured by an inter-hemispheral MRI perfusion “time to peak” (TTP) delay on the side of stenosis. Among those whoare found to be hemodynamically impaired and have baseline cognitive impairment, the cognitivebatteries at baseline and at 1 year will determine if those with flow failure who are assigned torevascularization arm in CREST-2 will have better cognitive outcomes than those in the medical-only arm compared with this treatment difference for those who have no flow failure. Wehypothesize that hemodynamically significant “asymptomatic” carotid disease may represent one ofthe few examples of treatable causes of cognitive impairment. If cognitive decline can be reversedin these patients, then we will have established a new indication for carotid revascularizationindependent of the risk of recurrent stroke.',\n",
       " 'Large-scale genetic data has become increasingly available, providing many clues about the genetic basis ofhuman traits and diseases. However, ~90% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals are fromcommon, noncoding variants. Such variants are difficult to interpret and connect to biological insight because(1) there are generally multiple possible causal genes at each locus and (2) linking noncoding variants to thegenes they regulate is challenging, which obscures the biological processes involved. Many strategies formitigating this problem have been proposed. One such strategy is applying algorithms that look forcommonalities across loci, which can implicate biological processes through gene set enrichment analysis,pinpoint important epigenetic marks, and/or prioritize likely causal genes. A second strategy is assaying rareand low-frequency coding variants, which have less linkage disequilibrium and therefore more directly pinpointcausal genes. To facilitate progress from genetic association to biological hypotheses, I propose extending andcombining these strategies to develop several different methods. Specifically, I will take DEPICT, a gene setenrichment analysis method developed by our lab for GWAS data, and adapt it for use with the ExomeChip(which genotypes coding rare- and low-frequency variants). DEPICT has the particular advantage of usinggene sets that have been extended via coexpression data to make predictions about the function ofuncharacterized genes, so it is especially powerful as a tool for biological interpretation. DEPICT alsoprioritizes causal genes for GWAS based on the similarity of their gene set memberships. However, manyother methods for prioritization have been developed and it is difficult to know which are the most accurate. Iwill therefore develop a method for rigorous comparison of existing prioritization strategies and use it todetermine which are the most effective. Finally, interpretation of whole-genome sequencing data is hamperedby the challenge of linking noncoding variants to genes and the large sample sizes needed to achievesufficient power to detect associations. I will develop a gene-set-based approach that incorporates epigeneticinformation and will use it to improve power for detection of rare and low-frequency noncoding variation inanthropometric traits. Completion of this project will result in a number of useful tools for extracting biologicalinsight from genetic association data that draw on the advantages of gene set enrichment analysis and thepower of focusing on rare- and low-frequency variation.',\n",

       " \"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACTAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiplegenetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset forAD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individualswith 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetimeAD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many ofthe apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stayasymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the lattergroup to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk.Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerativedisorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN)gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRNmutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how thesame mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial forunraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments.Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derivedfrom AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in humanneurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well-characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to studydisease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this projectare to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to ADpathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How doheterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e.,FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., A�production/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSClines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine thetranscriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOADpatients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlyingmechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations causeNCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeuticdevelopment by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels.\",\n",

About 10% of these, or 700,000 are persistent; this is animportant risk factor for cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer. The dynamics of HPV infection and thesubsequent development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are not well understood. Theproposed study will characterize the temporal relationship of vaginal microbiota associated with Metronidazoletreatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). It will also examine whether Metronidazole treatment ofasymptomatic BV is associated with detection of oncogenic HPV and persistence of oncogenic HPV infections.The proposed pilot study will utilize existing vaginal swabs from 80 women followed over six monthsfrom the BRAVO study, a randomized controlled open labeled clinical trial examining Metronidazole treatmentof asymptomatic BV. The vaginal microbiome will be characterized using high throughput 16s rRNA encodinggene pyrosequencing. The proposed research fits with priorities of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) andNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). NCI has prioritized racial and ethnic disparities inthe incidence and mortality of certain cancers and prevention or early detection of these cancers in specificpopulations and NIAID has set “screening, diagnosis and interventions for target populations to determine howto triage various groups for appropriate prevention, treatment and education strategies” as an overarchingpriority. There are also compelling public health reasons for supporting this application: In spite of theavailability of prophylactic HPV vaccination, there are still more than 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deathsworldwide from cervical cancer related to persistent HPV infections each year. This innovative research willcomplement current HPV vaccine research by providing more data on how the dysbiosis associated with BVallows HPV to bypass vaginal defenses to infect basal epithelial cells—providing information that couldcontribute to more effective vaccines.

       " \"OVERALL SUMMARYIn India, the world's largest democracy and second most populous country, malaria remains an enormouspublic health problem. Malaria in India is 'complex'; two predominant species of parasite may be presentserially or concurrently in one person. Each species also has multiple strains (genotypes) that can serially orconcurrently infect. Indian malaria complexity, its variation by location, and its consequences for malariaimmunity and severity, are the research focus of the CSCMi. The aims of the Center are to develop theknowledge, tools, and evidence-based strategies needed to support Indian intervention and control programs,and to build research capacity in India. CSCMi research comprises three projects: Project 1: Epidemiology ofmalaria and infection dynamics, Project 2: P. vivax diagnosis, genomics and biology, and Project 3:Pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Project 1 will undertake census, cross-sectional surveys, survey-cohorts,and clinic-based cohort studies for malaria baseline epidemiology and identification of asymptomatic n=andrelapse individuals at our three ecologically and epidemiologically diverse field sites in Sundergarh District,Odisha, West Garo Hills in Meghalaya, and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya. It will use biological samples collectedduring these studies to assess how infection complexity impacts seroepidemiology and CD4+ immunesignatures in asymptomatic versus clinical malaria. Project 2 will investigate biomarkers of P. vivax hypnozoiteinfection, and deploy real-time genomics methods of diagnosis and for population genomics. Project 3 will usemagnetic resonance imaging techniques to study cerebral malaria pathogenesis in an unprecedented andcomprehensive comparative analysis between patients in India and Malawi, and investigate molecularpathogenetic mechanisms of disease. The CSCMi projects will be supported by an Administrative Core andData Management and Biostatistics Core, and advised by a team of consultants and a Scientific AdvisoryGroup.\",\n",
       " 'SUMMARY Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant parasitic disease in the north-east of India. It is caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani and is characterized by immune dysfunction that can result in VL patients being more susceptible to secondary infections. There is no effective vaccine to prevent or treat VL, and current drug treatment is undermined by cost, toxicity and the potential development of drug-resistant parasites. We will measure the frequency and activation status of key immune cells¸ including T cells and monocytes, in the blood, bone marrow and skin of VL patients before, during and after drug treatment. In addition, we will characterize transcriptional and metabolic signatures in these cell populations to identify novel molecules to target for therapeutic advantage or to identify individuals likely to relapse or develop disease complications. In addition, we will test whether specific immune responses against parasite antigens can be used to identify individuals with asymptomatic infections. There is a great need to better understand host immune responses in VL patients. The identification of immune markers that detect T cells and/or monocytes that have recently encountered parasite antigen in our studies will allow us to monitor and measure parasite burden amongst populations in VL endemic regions, and would represent a major achievement for this Project, as well as providing a valuable diagnostic tool for VL elimination Programs. We will work with colleagues in Project 1 to identify asymptomatic individuals for immune studies, as well as to identify novel markers that can be used to identify these individuals who would not normally be recognized by conventional means of detection. In addition, work on Phlebotomine sand fly vectors conducted in Project 2 will help guide experiments aimed at better understanding immune responses in the skin proposed in this project. For example, we will investigate the influence of the local immune environment in the skin on the ability of the host to transmit infection to a sand fly. Thus, our Project not only focuses on the impact of VL on the host, but also on transmission and maintenance of disease in the region, and as such, will generate important complimentary data for other Projects within the Program. Elimination of VL is considered an achievable goal, and the work proposed in this Project will help to achieve this. Our research also has direct implications and applications for many diseases because the immunoregulatory and metabolic pathways we study are likely to be present in other chronic diseases, and our discoveries will thus have broad applications in medicine.',\n",

Manyunknowns persist with regard to the feasibility of totally interrupting L. donovani transmission,especially as only 1 out of 10 infections leads to clinical disease. The intent of the scientific groupplanning this application is to generate a body of knowledge and an investigative team that is readyfor any resurgence of the disease, possibly in new endemic areas of the country.We propose three research projects focused on the parameters of transmission and persistence ofL.donovani in India. Project 1 will use methods established in prior funding periods for surveillanceand monitoring of VL, and use global metabolomics profiling to identify biomarkers of asymptomaticinfection, and put this in the context of the gut microbiome and co-infection with other NTDs as risksfor progression to VL. Project 2 will monitor the emergence of insecticide resistant populations ofPhlebotomus argentipes, the sand fly vector for VL, and examine factors underlying vectorcompetence and the transmissibility of L. donovani from human or animal reservoirs. Project 3 willexamine immune factors underlying and contrasting symptomatic VL versus asymptomatic L.donovani infection, both systemically and localized in the skin. The Health and DemographicSurveillance System (HDSS) that was initiated in the current funding period will monitor thedemographics and health status of selected populations in Bihar State. Thus, the program willcomprehensively examine the extrinsic and intrinsic host factors that underlie the maintenance andcontinued transmission of VL in Bihar State, India.Aims of the TMRC program are: (1) To maintain and further develop the TMRC as a VL Center ofExcellence that addresses knowledge gaps as India progresses toward the goal of diseaseelimination; (2) To discover environmental and entomological factors that promote diseasepersistence in the population; (3) To discover human immune factors that determine whether aninfected person will develop an asymptomatic or symptomatic outcome; (4) To transform the HDSSinto a forward-looking program that is ready for future studies of disease outbreaks, treatment, orimmunoprophylaxis of endemic infectious diseases.The research team includes a multi-disciplinary group of investigators sharing the ambition to train thenext generation of Indian VL experts.

The Clinical Core of the Translational Center ofMolecular Profiling in Preclinical and Established Lupus will be the foundation for three Research Projectsthat focus on molecular comparisons and contrasts between clinically asymptomatic and symptomaticautoimmunity to elucidate protective, inciting, and perpetuating events in the pathogenesis of SLE. The ClinicalCore will leverage access to two unique sources of patient material: 1) the Research Registry for NeonatalLupus (RRNL), which provides a rare opportunity to study asymptomatic women at risk for developing SLEwho are identified to have anti-Ro antibodies solely based on the diagnosis of neonatal lupus in an offspring; 2)the NYU Lupus Cohort, a large well-characterized prospective multiracial/ethnic cohort; and 3) healthy controlsage, ethnically/racially, and gender matched to subjects. The Clinical Core will provide detailed phenotypicanalysis of these two cohorts by linking clinical data inclusive of validated disease activity and flare instrumentsspecific to Lupus to precisely define timing of flares and remissions with biologic inquiries related to genetics,the microbiome, B and T cells, and autoantibody profiles. These goals will be accomplished via three specificaims: Specific Aim 1 will develop and maintain a clinical database and linked sample repositorycomprised of mothers enrolled in the RRNL and a prospectively followed cohort of subjects with overtSLE. Clinical data will be matched with subject blood and stool samples (specific to the needs of the ResearchProjects), which will be stored and maintained by the Clinical Core. Specific Aim 2 will establish a workflowfor the delivery of specimens and linked clinical data to investigators in Projects 1, 2, and 3 with sampleprocurement coordinated to provide both fresh and stored specimens driven by the research protocols.Specific Aim 3 will incorporate appropriate statistical resources to perform analyses correlatingresearch data with matched clinical data. It is anticipated that the Clinical Core will provide anunprecedented platform upon which state-of-the-art technologies can be applied to precisely phenotyped andlongitudinally followed cohorts.',\n",
       " 'Vascular cognitive impairment is an insidious disease resulting from accumulated ischemic injury to thebrain. Our VA Merit-funded Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis and Cognitive Function (ACCOF) found that in thesetting of carotid stenosis, alterations of behavior can occur in the absence of physical manifestations ofstroke. Otherwise asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis had worse cognitive performance than controls.In addition, approximately 40% of patients with stenosis had cerebral hemodynamic compromise at baseline;and hemodynamic compromise correlated with cognitive impairment. Not all patients with carotid stenosis havereduced cerebral perfusion. The geometry of the plaque (degree of stenosis, length and shape of the plaque)and, as we have demonstrated, the extent of intra-cerebral collateralization across the Circle of Willis, influencecerebral perfusion. The implication of these findings is that a subset of carotid stenosis patients has hemodynamiccompromise, and that reversal of the hemodynamic abnormalities by removing the stenosis mayameliorate the associated cognitive impairment. Therefore, treatment for carotid stenosis might need to bebroadened to include preservation of cognition-related Quality of Life (QoL). The demonstration that somepatients with carotid stenosis are living with reversible cognitive impairment would have important public-healthimplications. Carotid stenosis affects 2-12% of people. With 23 million Veterans in the country, approximately1 million (4.3%) will have a stenosis. ACCOF shows that these patients are at risk for cognitive impairmentwhich, with intervention, might be reversible. We propose a longitudinal controlled observational study that assesses whether carotid revascularizationimproves cognitive dysfunction in patients with cerebral hemodynamic compromise. Proof of concept (followedby a clinical trial) is necessary before a shift in clinical practice is considered. If cognitive decline can bereversed in these patients, we will have established a new indication for carotid revascularization independentof stroke prevention. We will enroll 138 patients with asymptomatic high-grade (≥70%) carotid stenosisundergoing planned carotid endarterectomy. Approximately 40% (n=55 patients) of patients are anticipated tohave compromised cerebral perfusion at baseline (study group); the remaining 60% (n=83) will have carotidstenosis but will not have compromised perfusion (control group). Our Primary Aim will determine if carotid revascularization improves cognitive performance at 1 year inpatients with cerebral hemodynamic compromise at baseline. We hypothesize that among patients withasymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy, cognitive performance will improve more inthose with impaired cerebral perfusion at baseline versus those with normal baseline perfusion. OurSecondary Aim 1 will determine whether cerebral hemodynamic compromise is the result of pressure dropacross the carotid artery stenosis. We hypothesize that among all patients enrolled, the degree of PWI-TTPdelay at baseline will correlate with the degree of pressure drop across the carotid stenosis. Pressure drop willbe measured by patient-specific computational fluid dynamic modeling based on 3D imaging of carotid luminalgeometry, flow measurements, and analysis of the circulation in the Circle of Willis. Secondary Aim 2 willdetermine whether cognitive improvement after revascularization is the result of improved cerebralhemodynamics. We hypothesize that among patients with delayed PWI-TTP at baseline, the degree ofimprovement in cognition after revascularization will correlate with the improvement in pressure drop.Secondary Aim 3 will determine whether differences in cognitive outcome between the two groups impactquality of life. We hypothesize that 1 year after revascularization, quality of life will improve more in patientswith impaired baseline cerebral perfusion versus those without impairment.',\n",
       " \"At the population level, malaria remains an intractable problem in Malawi, a small but ecologically diversecountry in southeastern Africa. The reasons for malaria's intransigence are enigmatic, but new findingsemerging from our current ICEMR investigations have provided some clues: \\uf0b7 Plasmodium parasite infection prevalence is greater in school-age children than in under-five year olds \\uf0b7 School-age children are also most likely to carry gametocytes, the stage infectious to Anopheles vectors \\uf0b7 Molecular (q-PCR) diagnostic tests revealed low-level infection in people who were asymptomatic, hence not being treated ( hidden reservoirs ), hence a likely source of undetected transmission \\uf0b7 Anopheles vector abundance varied across a 20-km radius around a major urban center, with  hot spots  being linked to micro-environmental heterogeneity, and not to a simple urban-rural designation \\uf0b7 Prevention failures may result from insecticide resistance and patterns of insecticide treated net use.At the individual level, only a small proportion of people infected with Plasmodium parasites ever experiencesymptoms of malaria illness; most co-exist asymptomatically with the parasite. An even smaller proportionevolves into severe and complicated malaria, but the mortality rates are high. The mechanisms underlyingprogression along the infection-to-disease spectrum are not known, in part because reliably identifyingindividuals at the infection extremes (persistently asymptomatic and life-threatening cerebral malaria) has onlyrecently become feasible.The Malawi ICEMR team has the capacity to sustain long-term observations of human cohorts in differenttransmission settings and to collect extensive ecological, entomological and parasitological data to evaluate: \\uf0b7 patterns of pathogen transmission and human host responses, \\uf0b7 effectiveness of multiple interventions against transmission and infection in different environments, \\uf0b7 relationships between infection frequency/duration and disease severity, \\uf0b7 impacts of insecticide resistance and insecticide treated net (ITN) quality and use on disease patterns, \\uf0b7 contributions of parasite growth rate, clonality, pro- and anti-inflammatory host responses \\uf0b7 importance of “holes” in the immune response to variant surface antigens to disease progression.Over the course of seven years of research, which will span Malawi's next large national ITN distributionprogram, the Malawi ICEMR will identify why malaria control efforts in Malawi have been ineffective thus far,and will provide data-driven suggestions regarding approaches that are more likely to be effective.

       " \"1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 2 (No longer than 30 lines of text)3 Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained dysrhythmia worldwide. Although new AF4 treatment strategies have emerged over the last decade, a major challenge facing clinicians and 5 researchers is the paroxysmal, often short-lived, and frequently asymptomatic nature of AF. Paroxysmal 6 and asymptomatic AF would be found in a growing percentage of our population if it were detectable, and 7 causes major long-term health consequences despite being so silent. There is, therefore, a pressing need to 8 develop an inexpensive device for long-term, continuous monitoring containing an accurate real-time AF 9 detection algorithm, to lower our nation's healthcare costs. Such a device would not only increase rates of10 detection in symptomatic patients and allow for better evaluation of treatment efficacy, but could become11 widely-adopted enough to flush out asymptomatic people, if coupled with a strong awareness campaign.12 Given the ever-growing popularity of wearable devices, our approach to AF detection using leadless13 wearable armbands and a smartphone app will give patients as well as health care providers the14 opportunity to monitor for AF under the wide variety of conditions in a patient's real life. We want to make15 a device the user can truly live in, long term. Because our approach does not involve ECG leads, it will be16 minimally obtrusive, thereby leading to better acceptance and use by patients. Our wearable device has17 the potential to disrupt the traditional delivery of AF healthcare. For this objective to be successfully18 achieved, four key technology pillars must be commercialized. The first is an accurate AF detection19 algorithm. The second is a reusable, rugged, flexible electrode material that does not cause skin irritation20 with prolonged use in all real-world conditions. The third is an accurate motion artifact removal21 algorithm. The fourth is leadless ECG capture. The first two technological developments have been22 achieved by our company's CTO. Our AF algorithm has been shown to be accurate in multiple peer-23 reviewed publications, and is now commercially available in a Holter monitor from Scottcare Corporation.24 We have also developed novel waterproof, flexible, gel-less, reusable electrodes that do not cause skin25 irritation. Hence, the objective of this SBIR project is to bring to maturity the last two pillar technologies.26 Preliminary work on concepts for both show great promise. We believe this work will result in rapid27 translation in later Phases into an innovative and disruptive AF detection product. The envisioned product28 has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare costs by accurately and more succinctly establishing the29 diagnosis of AF in at-risk groups, thereby providing clinicians with an opportunity to prevent expensive30 secondary complications of these life-threatening arrhythmias.\",\n",
       " 'AbstractAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, affecting a growingpopulation of over 2.2 million Americans. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a self-terminating form of thecardiac arrhythmia that comprises between 25% and 60% of AF cases. It is a growing epidemic incardiovascular disease, predicted to afflict over 16 million people in the United States alone by 2050.Advancing age is a major risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation. The prevalence of AF in peopleover the age of 75 is 6-8%, and it exceeds 15% in individuals over 80. For this reason, opportunistic screeningof AF has been recommended in high risk individuals, including people over the age of 75, individuals over 65with hypertension, and patients with previous stroke of uncertain etiology. PAF may be a single episode orclusters of abnormal rhythms with variable duration. PAF is often asymptomatic, and in those patients withsymptoms, it has been estimated that for every symptomatic episode there are 10 asymptomatic ones. Theself-terminating nature of PAF leads to its frequent under-diagnosis and consequent lack of use of establishedstroke prevention therapies. The proposed wearable screening tool based upon photoplethysmography tiesclinical data collected at home directly to the clinician; is completely unobtrusive and does not require surgicalimplantation. This system could identify even brief episodes of atrial fibrillation and prevent significant morbidityand mortality by identifying individuals who would benefit from therapy, such as anticoagulation, thatsignificantly reduces stroke risk. The innovation of this project is a low cost and practical solution for providingsuch screening. A prototype system will be developed and evaluated human pilot study in phase 1.',\n",

Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiviral therapy may prevent progressivehearing loss if administered early in life for severely affected (symptomatic CMV) infants.

One approach is CMV testing only those newbornswho fail their newborn hearing screening. This path has been advocated as a targeted option to identify thoseinfants at greatest risk to develop progressive hearing loss.

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY In gout, acute arthritis flares are often severe, and impair quality of life. Acute gout flares increase early, and persist for years, in the titration and first years of maintenance of otherwise successful urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Yet symptomatic gout manifests variably in established gout. Furthermore, gout does not uniformly develop in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, despite detectable tissue urate crystal deposits in ~25%. Serum urate (sUA) level helps guide clinical decision-making, eg, ULT to specific sUA target, or to identify ULT efficacy (monitoring biomarker). sUA fulfills criteria for gout surrogate biomarker, as a surrogate end point in clinical trials. However, sUA has no clear role in assessing the inflammatory state in gout. As such, there is major unmet need for better biomarkers not only for incident gout in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, but also for which gout patients will develop more frequent and severe flares, and thereby, to advance gout precision medicine (CORT theme), by predicting need and duration, and monitor effectiveness of potentially toxic gout flare colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis, particularly after starting and maintaining ULT. Our scientific premise directly addresses these needs, building on our recent discovery that the metabolic energy biosensor AMP activated Kinase (AMPK) controls  on and off switches  for model gouty inflammation. Remarkably, AMPK also is a primary transducer of therapeutic effects of colchicine and methotrexate. Moreover, we present striking Preliminary Studies for attenuated PBL AMPK activity in gout compared to healthy controls. Here, we will translate basic findings that constitutive AMPK activity markedly limits the inflammatory potential of urate crystals in vivo, partly by blunting activation of the inflammation master regulator NF-κB, and by limiting urate crystal NLRP3 inflammasome activation/IL-1β release by macrophages. Significantly, AMPK activity both regulates and reflects nutrition, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory stressors, with tissue AMPK activity known to be diminished in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Significantly, low AMPK activity promotes common gout comorbid conditions (CORT theme), ie, hypertension, CKD onset, progression and associated renal fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis. To test the hypothesis that low AMPK activity predicts more frequent and severe inflammatory gouty arthritis flares, we will assay PBL AMPK activity, and specific AMPK-targeted metabolites (assessed by metabolomics) in gout, healthy controls, and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We will perform an ancillary study of gout subjects in the VA CSP594 comparative effectiveness study of titrated allopurinol vs. febuxostat ULT, titrated to urate target, but with flares at 72 weeks as the primary endpoint. We also will test the hypothesis that, in gout, low PBL AMPK activity is a marker for patients with greater than the median inflammatory flares/year, and for increased NF-κB activity. Project completion will translate metabolic regulation of inflammation to a novel biomarker and target for preventing acute gout flares.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with hyperuricemia (HU) and gout; however, the causal relationship is unclear. Of >30 urate genes identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), ten are also associated with CKD. Genetic variation in urate transporters (e.g., SLC2A9, encoding the GLUT9 transporter) has been implicated in HU and gout; however, exact causal genes and their mechanisms are unclear. The regulatory effects on GLUT9 and other urate transporters and signaling networks associated with HU and CKD are highly relevant to understanding the functional genomics of HU and its causality with CKD. Furthermore, APOL1 protein, linked to the genetic risk of CKD in African Americans, is co-expressed with GLUT9, and our data suggest an association of APOL1 genotype on serum urate (sUA).Our goal is to fill these key knowledge gaps by unraveling the molecular relationship between HU and CKD. To achieve this, we propose key translational genetic and functional studies, using cutting-edge translational physiology and genetics. In Aim 1 we will screen and characterize regulatory proteins (including APOL1) implicated in both HU and CKD to identify functional interactions with urate transport. To accomplish this we will first examine the effects on urate transport in co-expression with GLUT9 and other urate transporters in Xenopus oocytes. This approach has already revealed novel physiology for the digenic TMEM171/174 locus, with inhibition of basolateral GLUT9 by TMEM171 and of apical URAT1 transport by TMEM174. Multiple resequencing resources will be screened for uncommon penetrant coding variants in these regulatory genes, segregating with extremes in sUA; functional effects of these variants will then be characterized. In Aim 2 we propose state-of-the-art genetic approaches using very large, publicly available data sets to discover the causality and shared genetic etiology of HU and CKD. To determine the relative importance of shared genetic and/or environmental contributions to HU and CKD, we will quantify directly the genome-wide marker-based genetic and environmental correlation between sUA and eGFR/CKD using multivariate Bayesian whole genome regression (WGR). To ascertain specific genes and pathways jointly contributing to HU and eGFR/CKD we will estimate the genetic correlation in genomic regions using WGR. We will investigate a causal role of urate-raising genetic variants in reduced renal function; this will be formally tested by Mendelian randomization. Finally, there is a major unmet need for a genetically tractable model of human urate homeostasis. Our group has shown that human stem-cell- derived kidney cells self-organize into human kidney organoids that functionally recapitulate tissue-specific epithelial physiology. In Aim 3 we will utilize this system to study CKD- and HU-associated genes, first analyzing the role of a regulatory SNP in the TMEM171/174 locus and the individual roles of TMEM171 and TMEM174 in renal tubular urate physiology. Completion of the project will yield novel tools for translational urate research and novel insight into shared pathways in CKD and HU, suitable for therapeutic targeting.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid tumors will not grow beyond 3 - 4 mm in diameter without building up their own blood supply. Due to the essential role of tumor angiogenesis, anti-angiogenesis, mono-therapy or in- combination with other therapeutic agents, represents a very promising approach for cancer treatments. Great successes have been achieved, such as Avastin, a FDA approved anti- angiogenesis drug. However, clinical studies revealed that the cancer patient survival benefits of antiangiogenic drugs have thus far been insignificant. In addition, most current studies in development of anti-angiogenesis agent have been mainly focused on strategies of blocking VEGF/VEGFR signaling. Many agents that are developed against the VEGF/VEGFR pathway often cause unwanted biologic side effects. There is urgent need to develop anti-angiogenesis agents by targeting many other biological pathways that are involved in both stimulation and inhibition of cancer angiogenesis. We have developed a new class of anti-angiogenesis proteins by integrin �v�3 at a novel site, the large pocket formed by the I-domain of �v and the PSI domain of �3. Computational modeling demonstrated that the domain 1 of rat CD2 and human CD2 spatially fit into the designed site very well. Mutations introduced at the D1-CD2 to bridge several key contacts between designed protein and the integrins optimize the binding of the designed protein with integrin. The designed proteins exhibit strong in vitro activity in induction of apoptosis on endothelial HUVEC cells with no effects on other cells. Tests with tumor nude mice PC-3 xenografts show that the designed proteins strongly inhibit tumor growth. Parallel analyses suggested that our developed protein anti-angiogenesis agents are significantly more effective than Avastin in inhibiting tumor growth. In this proposed research project, we propose experiments to further verify whether the designed protein indeed interact with integrin at the designed site, and whether the designed protein indeed exert its activity by targeting the integrin. We will extensively test the effectiveness of the developed protein anti-angiogenesis agents by various animal models of human cancers. We also design experiments to test whether our developed anti-angiogenesis proteins will have great potency for cancer treatment in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. To facilitate potential future clinical applications, we propose experiments to extensively characterize toxicity and bio-distribution of the protein agents. Our study will lead to development of a new and more effective anti-angigenesis agent for cancer treatment.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYLyme disease, due to infection with the Ixodes tick-transmitted spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) is the mostcommon vector-borne disease in the United States, with over 300,000 new cases annually. Infection can resultin asymptomatic IgG seroconversion or cause clinical disease manifesting as an isolated skin lesion erythemamigrans (EM) or with systemic illness involving the skin, heart, nervous system and/or joints. The infection ismost responsive to antibiotics when identified early, but those people with disseminated infection or in whomtreatment is delayed can experience debilitating disease that can become unresponsive to antibiotics. Theimmune responses to Bb associated with asymptomatic IgG seroconversion and that give rise to specific organsystem involvement are poorly understood. This proposal will profile the innate and adaptive immuneresponses that arise after Bb infection in well-characterized patients with a) asymptomatic IgG seroconversion;b) isolated EM; c) acute disseminated infection with multiple EM and/or neurologic disease; and d) the latemanifestation of arthritis. We will use novel state-of-the-art technologies to deeply characterize the immuneresponse to Bb over time, both phenotypically and functionally, and correlate these responses with clinicalpresentations and outcomes. State-of-the-art high-resolution technologies such as CyTOF will be conductedon whole blood and synovial fluid, and T cell library populations exhibiting different chemokine receptorsdefining cytokine secretion and tissue migration will be generated to evaluate antigen-specific responses. Thetranscriptomes of responding T cell subsets in blood and other cell populations of interest identified by CyTOFwill be analyzed by single cell RNAseq. Novel nanowell technologies will be used when cell samples arelimiting, as in the case of skin biopsies or CSF samples, to characterize responding cells at the single cell levelphenotypically using MuSIC (MultiSpectral Imaging Cytometry). These same tissues will be interrogated forimmune signatures found in blood vs those unique to these sites and will be further assessed by single cellRNAseq. Along with the immune responses, we will also profile the host metabolome to define metabolitesignatures associated with divergent clinical outcomes. Enabling this understanding of the immune responsewill be a systems biology approach to data integration, including clinical status, host metabolites and in vitrocell responses, to support an in-depth analysis and modeling of the host metabolic and immune responses asthey evolve in subjects with Lyme disease. The output of this functional systems immunology approach will bedefinitions of human metabolite and immune signatures following infection with an extracellular bacterialpathogen Bb that will be compared to other infectious pathogens, with the ultimate goal of defining futuretargets for intervention and predicting susceptibility or resistance to systemic disease.',\n",
       " \"ABSTRACTIncreasing evidence suggests that autoantibodies antecede overt clinical disease by years, inclusive of anti-SSA/Ro among the earliest reactivities. Predicting who will progress would be a critical translational discovery.Mothers in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL) represent a unique population at risk for overtclinical autoimmunity. Despite high titer anti-Ro antibodies pathogenic to the developing fetus, many womenare asymptomatic and autoimmunity is identified solely based on disease in their offspring. In the RRNL, 243 of500 mothers were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms at the birth of the NL child. Nearly half of thesemothers later developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Theidentification of numerous susceptibility genes disproves a purely environmental cause for autoimmunediseases such as SLE, but susceptibility genes are not sufficient for the development of disease. In fact, thedisease probability given the genotype remains modest. These observations strongly imply that gene-environment interactions contribute to the risk of SLE. One environmental factor is an individual's microbiome,given the constant interchange between the immune system and bacterial species whose products prime cellswithin the innate and adaptive immune systems. We hypothesize that some HLA variation drives a pathologicmicrobiome which associates with progression from benign to pathologic autoimmunity and overt clinicaldisease. In addition, other HLA variation may correlate with a protective microbiome and clinical quiescence. InAim 1, associations will be sought between host genetics and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status. Feasibilityof the approach is based on prior genotyping of 147 RRNL mothers using the Illumina Immunochip. FromImmunochip SNPs, classical 4-digit HLA alleles have been imputed yielding a total of 119 unique HLA alleles.It will be determined whether SLE risk alleles, identified by the SLE Immunochip Consortium, correlate withmaternal disease status, and whether the SLE genetic risk allele load correlates with material disease status.In Aim 2, we will test for associations between gut bacterial species in the context of HLA and anti-Ro NLmaternal disease status. Using a DNAseq library from amplification of 16S rRNA gene regions, non-adjustedfor maternal HLA, preliminary results of microbiota profiling revealed an abundance of protective Rikenellaceaeand Oscillospira in 8 asymptomatic anti-Ro+ NL mothers compared to 35 overt SLE patients. Overallabundance, microbial diversity, and specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be correlated with HLAvariation, specific SLE/SS-risk variants, and overall SLE risk allele genetic load. In Aim 3, stool samples will becollected from mothers enrolled in the RRNL who have been previously genotyped but in whom matchedsamples have not yet been provided. To our knowledge, the proposed experiments will be the first tocharacterize the impact of a patient's microbiota on a preclinical disease state and to test whether host geneticvariation at the MHC locus influences a pathologic microbiome.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common, debilitating disorders affecting social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Recent genetic findings have identified mutations in synaptic cell adhesion genes and genes encoding their interacting protein partners at central synapses as genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders. This proposal will characterize novel and innovative autism mouse models that allow for brain development to take place with a genetic mutation. These particular models allow for reversal of the mutation at various times during brain development and ultimately in specific brain regions. The goal is to narrow the developmental critical period during which such mutations lead to altered brain function and atypical behavior. This information will allow scientists to focus specifically on the time periods and brain regions critical for generation of atypical behavior. In addition, these studies will substantiate feasibility of genetic and certain pharmacological approaches to treatment of a genetic form of autism. Progress to date is substantial in that the genetically reversible mutant mouse models related to autism have been established and characterization has begun.',\n",

       " 'SummaryDespite having reduced malaria transmission to historically low level, in many Asia-Pacific countries endemicareas transmission continues and common vector control tools seem not able to interrupt transmission. Thereasons for the resilience of malaria transmission are on unclear but are likely to involve not only parasite butalso host and vector factors. At low transmission, asymptomatic infections account for up to 90% of infectionsand it they are able to transmit efficiently they could be a key component of the infectious reservoir. The onlyway to accurately ascertain if an infection can transmit is to feed the blood to mosquitoes and determine rateand density of infections of the mosquito midgut. Such xenodiagnostic studies are severely lacking, inparticular in predominantly P. vivax endemic area. We are now proposing to conduct an in-depth dissection ofthe contribution of host, parasite and vector factors to maintaining malaria transmission by conducting a setstudies that combine assessment of the infectivity of well characterized field samples using direct membranefeeding (DFMA) with in-depth laboratory studies in 3 sites with substantially different transmission scenarios.Initially we will investigate the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections establish theassociation of parasite and gametocytes density with infectivity and study effect of transmission blockingimmunity, vector microbiome and type parasite for gene associated with evasion of mosquito immuneresponses and markers of artemisinin and partner drugs resistance to determine their effect on transmissionpotential. As parasite and gametocyte fluctuate over time, so may their infectivity. We will therefore determinethe temporal variation in infectivity an in-depth cohort study in PNG, where asymptomatic carriers will befollowed for 3 weeks and mosquitoes fed every 3-4 days. Addition, we will determine proportion of pre- andpost-treatment infectivity in in artemisinin-resistant and sensitive symptomatic P. falciparum. Together with ourlarge epidemiological datasets (see Project 1), this will allow us not only clarify the contribution ofasymptomatic infections to transmission but also resistance may come with a transmission associated fitnesscost, which may slow down the spread of resistance. Both human and vector behavior may limit human-vectorcontact in the Asia-Pacific, where vectors are frequently / predominantly outdoor biting, leading to transmissionaway from people’s dwelling. The low biting rate and unclear location of human-vector contact makes it difficultto identify its determinants. We will we study patterns of human vector contact by determining the presence ofantibodies against salivary gland protein antibodies proteins from An. dirus. An. minimus and An. Farauti insamples from cross-sectional and cohort studies in Project 1. By providing an in-depth understanding of thetransmission characteristics at each of our sites, the proposed studies will not only contribute to developingbiologically accurate transmission models but will help us design better methods to track and eliminatetransmission even in hard to track populations such asymptomatic carriers.',\n",

       " 'The broad, long-term objective of this project is to guide malaria elimination strategies in Amazonia taking intoaccount human, environmental, and biological features that combine to maintain hypoendemic malaria in theregion. The complexity of Amazonian malaria is augmented by intense human movement related to work andsocial interactions, which combined with asymptomatic infections lead to “silent” reservoirs of malaria parasitesmoving across space and time. Over the past ICEMR project period, population-based longitudinal cohortstudies in Brazil and Peru have demonstrated complex patterns of malaria transmission in epidemiologicallycontrasting sites (e.g., increasing transmission vs. disappearing malaria). This new Project will continuelongitudinal studies to delineate a fine level of malaria transmission and endemicity complexity in these andnew sites. This Project is based on the primary hypothesis (as is the entire Amazonia ICEMR program)that asymptomatic, subpatent parasitemia drive ongoing hypoendemic malaria. Residual malaria (dueto outdoor-biting Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes potentially related to anthropogenically-drivenchanging vector behaviors and genetics, Project 2) and emerging, complex patterns of malariareintroductions has made studying alternative approaches to malaria elimination a critical issue. In thisproject we seek to understand the patterns and determinants of two contrasting malaria epidemiologicalsettings in the Amazon: residual malaria with continuing hypoendemicity, and foci of high transmission. Thesesettings have different local ecologies (riverine, highway and urban areas) and human behavior (e.g., bednetuse, occupation, mobility). In Aim 1, we will gather data to calculate and interpret local indices of transmission,and to comprehensively identify local determinants of malaria transmission. Aim 1 integrates all three Projectsof the ICEMR by identifying and characterizing the context of malaria cases, and referring symptomatic andasymptomatic patients to Project 2 to guide mosquito population characterization and transmission biologystudies, and to Project 3 for immunological experiments, respectively. In Aim 2 comprehensive molecularepidemiological approaches and population genetics will be used to identify temporal population changes in P.vivax and P. falciparum, to detect reintroductions and parasite population replacements, and to estimateparasite population complexity at baseline and potentially after interventions. Aim 3, also integrating all threeICEMR projects, will model the dynamics of malaria transmission, simulate the optimal intervention packagesto reduce malaria in epidemiologically contrasting settings, explicitly accounting for ecological heterogeneityand differences in human socio-demographics. This Project will contribute new solutions to ongoing andemerging malaria challenges in Amazonia. The comprehensive molecular and epidemiological data sets fromthis Project, integrated with Project 2, studies of vector ecology and transmission biology, and with Project 3,immunology of asymptomatic malaria, will provide a roadmap for new approaches to malaria elimination.',\n",
       " 'AbstractKRAS mutations drive resistance to diverse targeted therapies, most notably to EGFR inhibitors in the settingof metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Curiously however, through a series of genetic screens involvingconstitutive activators of oncogenic signaling pathways, we found that ectopic expression of mutant HRAS,another RAS gene not typically associated with resistance, drove substantially stronger therapeutic resistancethan mutant KRAS. Although HRAS and KRAS share ~85% amino acid sequence identity, the nucleotidesequence between the two varies enormously, with HRAS being enriched in common codons that yield highprotein expression, while KRAS is enriched in rare codons that yield poor expression. This suggested that rarecodons may limit the ability of KRAS to impart resistance in the clinic. Consistent with this notion, we find thatprimary resistance to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab in CRC is dependent not only upon KRAS mutationalstatus, but also upon the ability of cancer cells to overcome the translational barrier imposed by codon bias.Similarly, we show that more potent KRASQ61 mutations drive acquired resistance even in the setting of lowprotein expression, perhaps explaining the paradoxical enrichment of these mutations observed in patientswith cetuximab-refractory CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that cancer cells globally upregulate translation in thesetting of KRASG12-driven acquired cetuximab resistance, resulting in hypersensitivity to diverse smallmolecule inhibitors of translation. These findings demonstrate that codon bias plays a critical regulatory role inKRAS-driven therapeutic resistance and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting protein translation toovercome resistance.',\n",
       " 'Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the US, causing atleast 450,000 infections and 29,000 associated deaths per year. Current C. difficile infection (CDI) preventionstrategies have not decreased CDI. These strategies focus on preventing C. difficile transmission only frompatients with symptomatic CDI, and ignore the much more common asymptomatic C. difficile carriers.Asymptomatic C. difficile carriers contaminate the hospital environment, transfer C. difficile spores tohealthcare workers hands, and introduce strains associated with subsequent CDI cases. In addition, recentstudies suggest at least 30% to 50% of new CDI cases are a result of transmission from asymptomatic C.difficile carriers. However, the potential impact of interventions directed at asymptomatic C. difficile carriers hasnot been adequately studied. One such strategy to prevent C. difficile transmission among hospitalizedpatients would be the use of gowns and gloves (contact precautions) for patients asymptomatically colonizedwith C. difficile. Identifying reductions in C. difficile transmission from asymptomatic carriers with contactprecautions would change the paradigm of C. difficile prevention. We hypothesize that patientsasymptomatically colonized with C. difficile are important for transmission in the hospital, and use of contactprecautions for these patients will lead to decrease in patient-to-patient transmission of C. difficile. The studydesign is a retrospective analysis of stored specimens that were obtained from a 20 hospital cluster-randomized trial. Aim 1 will assess whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact decreasesacquisition of and infection with C. difficile. Aim 2 will assess the relative importance of colonization pressurewith C. difficile on C. difficile transmission, and Aim 3 will determine if the NAP-1/027 strain is moretransmissible than other strains. This innovative approach will develop the first randomized trial level data toguide C. difficile infection prevention and will inform science on the importance of individuals asymptomaticallycolonized with NAP-1/027 or other C. difficile strains. This proposal will go beyond the original cluster trial inAim 1 to assess key questions of colonization pressure, contact precautions and NAP-1/027 on C. difficiletransmission.',\n",

       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYBoth the innate and acquired immunity play important roles on systemic inflammation and pathogenesis ofmalaria as well as host resistance to Plasmodium infection. When patients are symptomatic with disease, theygenerally seek curative therapy, thus interrupting potential transmission. In contrast, individuals withasymptomatic disease, at least in theory, remain as reservoirs of disease. In this project, we will addressquestions related to the innate and acquired immune responses that are relevant to understanding theemergence and persistence of asymptomatic malaria individuals. Our previous epidemiological studies in theAmazon suggest that multiple malaria infections result in substantial immunity, which is able to control, but noteliminate malaria infection. In contrast to the acutely ill patients, the malaria immune individuals do not displaysystemic inflammation and signs of disease. Our overall hypothesis is that innate immune cells fromindividuals with low and persistent parasitemia, become hyporesponsive to Plasmodium stimulationpreventing systemic inflammation, but at the same time being unable to promote an acquired immuneresponse that is efficient in eliminating infection. We believe that despite the low levels of parasitemia, andthe predicted low rate of transmission per mosquito bite, such patients continue to be infective over longperiods of time and hence represent a silent barrier to efforts to eliminate malaria in the Amazon. In thisproject, we propose to compare the innate and acquire immune responses elicited by Plasmodium infection inacutely ill and asymptomatic patients, and to define mechanisms that are potentially involved in modulating thesystemic inflammation and preventing parasite elimination in asymptomatic malaria patients. Our first aim is tocompare the inflammatory response and responsiveness of innate immune cells from clinically ill andasymptomatic malaria patients. In the second aim we will compare the development of humoral and cellularacquired immune responses as well as immunoregulatory mechanisms that may influence hyper and hypoinnate immune responses in patients undergoing acute versus asymptomatic P. vivax or P. falciparuminfection. Finally, in Aim 3 we will investigate in longitudinal studies, various immunological, parasitological andclinical parameters in patients with recurrent infection. We intend to validate the biomarkers defined in Aims 1and 2, and to interrogate whether asymptomatic patients are prone to develop no diseases in recurrentinfections. We will also search for immunological correlates of infectivity of symptomatic and asymptomatic P.vivax parasitemics for colonized An. darlingi mosquitoes. Outcomes of these experiments will identify innateimmune biomarkers as well as B and T cell responses that are predictive of disease outcome and mosquitotransmission. If successful, our studies will provide important information for monitoring silent infection ininfective asymptomatic individuals and potentially new insights to further control malaria transmission in hypo-endemic areas.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive decline insocial behavior, emotion, and language. In behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), the most common FTD subtype,impairment in emotion and empathy are hallmark features that arise due to degeneration of emotion circuits.Although bvFTD begins in frontoinsula and anterior cingulate cortex, brain regions with known roles invisceromotor emotion generation and autonomic integration, the earliest signs of emotion system dysfunctionare unknown. Approximately 40% of FTD cases are genetic and due to mutations in C9ORF72, GRN, andMAPT. Gene-positive mutation carriers offer a novel inroad into early emotion alterations in FTD becausethese individuals can be identified, studied, and followed during the asymptomatic, preclinical phase of diseaseand in the early symptomatic clinical phase. Changes in emotion physiology and behavior may occur early inthe disease, reflect decline in emotion-relevant brain networks, and relate to affective symptoms. The proposedstudies will help to characterize preclinical emotion deficits and their underlying circuitry and to determinewhether these deficits are early indicators of decline in FTD. Anatomically-specific markers could be used tomonitor symptom progression or to track disease-related dysfunction in clinical trials of asymptomatic or mildlysymptomatic individuals. This proposal integrates laboratory measures of autonomic nervous system reactivityand facial expression with multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to identify how emotion systems change in theearliest stages of FTD. We will study 100 asymptomatic gene-positive subjects (50 C9ORF72+, 30 GRN+, and20 MAPT+), 50 healthy controls (age-matched, gene-negative family members), 40 patients with bvFTD, and40 older age-matched healthy controls at two annual research visits. Subjects will undergo laboratory testing ofemotion in addition to a clinical work-up and structural and functional connectivity magnetic resonanceimaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that objective measures of emotion physiology and behaviorare direct readouts of vulnerable brain systems that can be measured noninvasively and track progression inthe in preclinical and early symptomatic phase of FTD. We will address three key aims. In Aim 1, we will isolatethe domains of emotional dysfunction in early FTD and determine how specific emotional deficits relate tobehavioral and affective symptoms. In Aim 2, we will delineate the neural circuitry underlying identifiedemotional deficits in bvFTD and preclinical FTD. In Aim 3, we will identify laboratory measures that trackemotion network decline over time in early FTD.

       " 'This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, and NCT00001322. The menopause transition is accompanied by a decrease in quality of life (QOL) measures for some women, and several randomized controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) have targeted QOL as a potential indication for HT. We have characterized the impact of Perimenopausal depression (PMD) on QOL, disability, social adjustment and role functioning. Our findings show that PMD is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment and impaired role functioning comparable to depression and anxiety disorders occurring at other stages of a womans life. Neither perimenopausal reproductive status alone nor the presence of hot-flushes had a significant negative impact on QOL measures. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified reflect pre-existing risk factors for depression during the perimenopause or the effects of a current depression. The latter question was recently clarified by the results of our longitudinal study of women as they transition through the perimenopause. Specifically, we examined whether the changes in negative life events and declines in QOL measures observed in cross-sectional studies were antecedents of PMD or reflect the effects of the presence of depression. Thus, we prospectively evaluated healthy women longitudinally across the menopause transition. Seventy asymptomatic, premenopausal women, ages 41-55 years, were monitored longitudinally for an average of 5.2 years until 6-12 months after their final menses (FMP). Outcome measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), as well as standardized measures of QOL, marital satisfaction, and life events. Twenty-eight episodes of major  and minor  depression occurred in twenty-two women, twenty-seven of these episodes occurred in the 2-years surrounding the FMP. Thus confirming reports by our group and others of the clustering of depressions during the late menopause transition a time associated with declining levels of ovarian estradiol secretion. During the four years prior to the FMP, compared to women who remained asymptomatic, women with PMD reported significantly lower life satisfaction in PMD but did not report significant differences in overall QOL, marital satisfaction, experience of personal loss, or negative life events. Thus, these data suggest that negative life events and decreased QOL/marital dissatisfaction do not uniformly precede the onset of PMD. Further, the relative absence of antecedent social or environmental in PMD suggests a more specific role for hormonal events in the triggering of PMD. \\tA role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiols antidepressant efficacy in PMD.  Additionally, we have completed a subsequent placebo-controlled study examining the effects on mood and behavior in women with PMD of estradiol and two compounds: the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), raloxifene and a phytoestrogen (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds). In this study we replicated our previous findings that estradiol therapy is effective in the treatment of PMD; however, neither raloxifene nor the phytoestrogen showed significant effects on symptoms in PMD. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop depression during the perimenopause.  In our studies of the effects of estradiol withdrawal on mood, we first examined the effects of inducing estradiol withdrawal and hypogonadism on mood symptoms in asymptomatic premenopausal women participating in our gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol. We observed only four women (5.6% of the sample) who reported Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores > 10 (suggestive of clinically significant symptoms of depression), and in only one of these women did the elevated BDI scores persist beyond two weeks duration. Neither plasma estradiol levels nor the severity of hot flushes correlated with mood rating scores.  Thus, in otherwise healthy women the induction of neither hypogonadism nor hot flushes (with an accompanying sleep disturbance) uniformly precipitates depressive symptoms. These data, and the results of epidemiologic data confirming that the majority of women do not develop depression during the menopause transition, led to our examining whether women with a past PMD are differentially sensitive to the effects of estradiol withdrawal.\\tWe next evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in women with and those without a past PMD.  In this study, asymptomatic postmenopausal women who experienced a depression during the menopause transition and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no past depression received a standard dose of estradiol (100 mcg per day).  After three weeks all women were randomly assigned under double-blind (DB) conditions to either continue estradiol (DB ET) or switch to placebo (DB placebo, estradiol withdrawal).  If estradiol withdrawal was a relevant physiologic event to trigger depression, then one would predict that depressive symptoms would develop in those women randomized to placebo.  Additionally, if women who develop depression during the perimenopause are differentially susceptible to the mood destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal, then mood symptoms should emerge in the women with past PMD but not the controls randomized to DB placebo.\\tResults demonstrate that estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with past PMD (n = 26), but not in those without such a history (n = 30).  None of the women reported depressive symptoms during open label estradiol. Women with past PMD who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity. Women with past PMD who continued on estradiol and all control women remained asymptomatic. Importantly, women with past PMD and control women had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during placebo and, therefore, neither differences in hot-flushes (and the attendant sleep-disturbance) nor peripheral estradiol levels accounts for the differential response to estradiol withdrawal. In women with past PMD, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. These data also suggest that women with a history of PMD should be alert to the risk of recurrent depression when discontinuing hormone therapy.  \\tIn collaboration with David Goldmans laboratory at NIAAA, we are currently investigating the effects of estradiol withdrawal on gene expression (RNA-seq) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained from women with past PMD and controls who had the presence and absence, respectively, of estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms confirmed in the clinical study. Finally, we will explore whether the estradiol withdrawal signal is mediated by ER alpha or beta (or both) by employing a selective ER beta agonist.  These data could identify a promising new class of therapeutic agents that are safer and more acceptable than estrogen and potentially lack the side effects or withdrawal syndromes associated with traditional psychotropics.  Additionally, it is possible that the selectivity of these compounds for estrogen receptor alpha and beta may identify the mechanisms of efficacy of estradiol on specific target symptoms.',\n",

Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin are frequently used in the treatment of AIDS-related KS but resistance to these agents does arise. Taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel have successfully been used to treat doxorubicin-resistant KS. However, no studies have examined the potential resistance mechanisms to taxanes in KS. As HAART is often administered concomitantly with chemotherapy when treating AIDS-related KS, it is important to examine the effects of recently-approved antivirals on potential resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy used to treat KS. Our interest in resistance mechanisms in Kaposi's sarcoma comes from our previous work with the ATP-dependent transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We previously demonstrated that P-gp can hamper HIV virus production and decrease infectivity in cells that overexpress the transporter. Additionally, a number of HIV protease inhibitors have been shown to be substrates of P-gp. In one cell line model of Kaposi's sarcoma, we found that anthracycline treatment leads to increased P-gp expression and that HIV protease inhibitors can further augment this expression. However, the cell line used for this study was recently shown to be mischaracterized, thus requiring a reevaluation of these results. Our current work focuses on the L1T2 cell line that has been shown to recapitulate clinical features of Kaposi's sarcoma in mouse models. We have characterized the drug resistance pattern of this cell line and are isolating resistant sublines of the L1T2 line to identify potential mechanisms of resistance using a Taq-man low-density array microfluidic chip to detect mRNA expression of 380 drug resistance-related genes comprising genes involved in drug efflux, DNA repair mechanisms, apoptosis and metabolizing enzymes. Additionally, these results will allow us to characterize the role that HIV protease inhibitors play in inducing or preventing resistance to chemotherapy. Ultimately we hope that identification of novel mechanisms of resistance in Kaposi's sarcoma will lead to improved therapies.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYNeurocysticercosis (NCC) is a common neurologic disease and a leading cause of preventable epilepsy acrossthe developing world. It is caused by central nervous infection with Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm) larvalcysts. While most cases of NCC have a relatively benign clinical course, the prognosis is grim for infectionsinvolving the subarachnoid space (SANCC). New approaches are needed to improve outcomes for patientswith this devastating malignant form of infection. One promising approach involves early detection throughpopulation screening, which would allow early intervention while the burden of infection is low and while thepatient retains relatively good health. We recently developed an assay that detects T. solium antigens excretedin the urine, and have now shown in pilot studies that this assay can be used to detect asymptomatic peoplewith SANCC in the community setting.In this 5-year project we will validate the new assay by applying it in a large cross-sectional study in northernPeru (30,000), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain as the gold standard to confirm diagnosis.Participants subsequently diagnosed with asymptomatic SANCC will be enrolled in either an 18-monthprospective observational cohort to determine risk of disease progression, or a small clinical trial evaluatingsafety of early intervention for asymptomatic SANCC. Furthermore, we will develop a prototype point-of-careformat of the assay and validate it with samples gathered from the community. The results of these studies willprovide information and tools necessary to conduct a definitive randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacyof screening and early intervention as an approach to improve clinical outcomes of patients with SANCC. Wewill also provide a series of didactic and hands-on laboratory and clinical research training opportunities forstudents from northern regions of Peru.',\n",

FACS analysis as well as Western Blot analysis show increased expression of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) in both paclitaxel and nelfinavir (protease inhibitor)-selected cells. Drug transporter activity assays show higher efflux of Rhodamine123 in cells selected with nelfinavir or taxol due to higher P-gp transporter activity. In accordance with those results, cells under prolonged selection with Nelfinavir showed higher resistance to taxol, whereas addition of valspadar, a P-gp inhibitor, made these cells more sensitive to the drug. These results suggest that HIV protease inhibitors may play a role in inducing resistance to chemotherapy.

       " 'Therapeutic peptide for hepatocellular carcinoma Niranjan B. Pandey, Ph.D. – PI Aleksander S. Popel, Ph.D. – Co-I Jordan J. Green Ph.D. – Co-IPhuoc T. Tran M.D., Ph.D. – PI of subcontractProject Summary:There are very limited options currently available for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), themost common type of liver cancer. HCC, like most forms of cancer, is dependent on angiogenesis, the growthof blood vessels. These and other tumors use VEGF and Ang2 to induce angiogenesis. The tumor also usesthese factors to suppress the immune system. Anti-VEGF agents inhibit angiogenesis and also allow someactivation of the immune system but they induce hypoxia which is itself immune suppressive. We haveidentified a peptide that simultaneously inhibits VEGF and activates Tie2, the receptor for Ang2. This peptide,AXT201, thus inhibits angiogenesis but promotes normalization of the remaining vasculature thus avoidinghypoxia and immune suppression. In addition by inhibiting VEGF and activating Tie2, AXT201 could make theimmune system more anti-tumorigenic by allowing more dendritic cell maturation, more T-cell proliferation andinfiltration into the tumor, and reduced number of regulatory T cells in the tumor.Checkpoint inhibitors are promising therapies for cancer but they have challenges with toxicity and also theyonly work in a minority of patients. The efficacy of these immunotherapies is minimized by an immune systemkept suppressed by tumors. We hypothesize that AXT201 will enhance the efficacy of an anti-PD-1 antibodyby making the immune system more anti-tumorigenic. Here we propose to determine if the combination ofAXT201 and anti-PD-1 antibody increase survival of mice with lethal, autochthonous HCC tumors compared toanti-PD-1 or AXT201 alone. We will also test for evidence of immune system activation by AXT201. Finally wepropose studies to facilitate translation of AXT201 into the clinic. Successful completion of the project willresult in the creation of a powerful, new therapeutic for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and alsohelp AsclepiX Therapeutics reach a critical milestone.',\n",

       " \"Recent developments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging research suggest that reducing future cases may be feasible by preventing AD in high-risk individuals by initiating treatments prior to neurodegeneration. Identifying such individuals requires characterizing the earliest stages of dementia when individuals are still asymptomatic and early disease effects are weak. To detect subtle (faint yet persistent) effects, large sample sizes are typically needed, but existing studies are not sufficiently large to provide high statistical power. Motivated by this critical need, this project will develop the statistical theory and algorithms needed to pool multi-cohort Alzheimer's disease datasets to facilitate large scale statistical analysis in samples of cognitively unimpaired individuals who are still asymptomatic. The development will be driven by (a) new shape analysis methods to characterize brain anatomy at the individual level and (b) statistical machine learning algorithms to enable seamless pooling of data from different studies/cohorts. Specific Aim 1: Develop novel shape analysis methods which enable testing advanced hypotheses in a way that is largely invariant to study-wise biases in Alzheimer's disease datasets collected at two different research sites (DELCODE, WRAP/WADRC) using compact descriptors of individual level brain anatomy (neuroanatomical signatures). Specific Aim 2: Derive new statistical theory and algorithms, based on classical statistical constructs and deep learning, for harmonizing shape features and other clinical/cognitive features focused on early Alzheimer's disease across the two sites. Specific Aim 3: Perform association and prediction analyses on the pooled datasets to evaluate novel scientific hypotheses related to early stages of Alzheimer's disease. We will analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, shape features  and longitudinal cognition (slopes/intercepts) and finally conduct analyses to better understand heterogeneity and sub-groups within the pooled cohort of cognitively unimpaired adults. Significance: This project will (i) lead to the development of efficient shape representation frameworks that will allow testing advanced localized hypotheses on brain regions of interest without requiring sub-field segmentation. The impact of these shape analysis methods will support spatially localized brain image analysis in Alzheimer's disease and in aging studies more generally. (ii) Produce harmonization algorithms and statistical theory to enable large scale data pooling in Alzheimer's disease as well as a broad range of other aging andneuroscience studies.\",\n",
       " \"AbstractRegular physical activity (PA) improves cardiovascular health, but majority of adults do not engage in enoughof it. A substantial proportion (48–71%) of variance in PA adherence is attributed to genomic variability, andseveral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified. The impact of this research will belimited, however, until we understand how these SNPs influence PA adherence. Understanding thepsychological phenotype that mediates genetic influence on PA adherence can provide new insights abouthow to improve PA adherence when someone is genetically predisposed to be less physically active. Ourobjectives are to examine the SNPs in brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) as predictors ofadherence to a PA promotion intervention and to identify a psychological phenotype that mediates this geneticeffect on behavioral phenotype (i.e., PA adherence).We propose to test our conceptual model in a secondary analysis and a pilot study: Genetic Variation \\uf0e0Affective Response to PA \\uf0e0 PA adherence. In this model, PA adherence is conceptualized as moderate tovigorous PA during- and post-intervention controlling for baseline moderate to vigorous PA.Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to examine the moderating effects of BDNF SNPs (rs6265 and rs12291063) onresponse to a PA promotion intervention in a secondary data analysis of 3899 overweight middle-aged adultsfrom the Look AHEAD trial. The Look AHEAD is a randomized controlled trial that examined the effect ofintensive lifestyle intervention, including weight loss and PA, relative to diabetes support and education (i.e.,control), on cardiovascular outcomes. Aim 2 of this proposal seeks to examine the association between BDNF(rs6265) and affective response to PA. We will conduct a pilot study among 60 previously sedentaryoverweight middle-aged adults. Aim 3 of this proposal seeks to examine affective response to PA as amediator between BDNF (rs6265) and PA adherence in the context of our pilot study. In the pilot study, wewill conduct a longitudinal observation study. At baseline, we will collect blood sample for genotype andmeasure affective response to PA while walking on a treadmill for 30 minutes. Then, all participants will beencouraged to increase PA using a print-based PA promotion program for the next 6 months. Moderate tovigorous PA rate will be measured for seven days via accelerometer at baseline, month 3 and month 6.This study will be the first to examine affective response to PA as a mediational phenotype using a full model:Genetic Variation → Affective response to PA → PA adherence. Funding of this fellowship will provide theapplicant training in genotyping, affect assessment, and accelerometry. Next steps in this research agendainclude extension of this model to larger samples and more SNPs to ultimately develop a novel behavioralintervention that uses individuals' SNP status to optimize affective response to PA to improve PA adherence.\",\n",

       " 'This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, and NCT00001322.  Our findings to date show that PMD is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment and impaired role functioning comparable to depression occurring at other stages of a womans life. However, neither perimenopausal reproductive status alone nor the presence of hot-flushes had a significant negative impact on QOL measures. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified reflect pre-existing risk factors for PMD or the effects of a current depression. Preliminary data from our longitudinal study of women transitioning through the menopause clarifies this relationship in part. We examined whether the changes in negative life events and declines in QOL measures observed in cross-sectional studies were antecedents of PMD or reflect the effects of the presence of depression. We prospectively evaluated healthy women longitudinally across the menopause transition. Seventy-six asymptomatic, premenopausal women, ages 41-55 years, were monitored longitudinally for an average of 5.2 years until 6-12 months after their final menses (FMP). Outcome measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), as well as standardized measures of QOL and life events. Twenty-nine episodes of major or minor depression occurred in twenty-three women, twenty-seven of these episodes occurred in the 2-years surrounding the FMP. Thus, confirming previous reports of the clustering of depressions during the late menopause transition a time associated with declining levels of ovarian estradiol secretion. During the four years prior to the FMP, compared to women who remained asymptomatic, women with PMD reported significantly lower life satisfaction in PMD but did not report significant differences in overall QOL, marital satisfaction, experience of personal loss, or negative life events. These data suggest that negative life events and decreased QOL/marital dissatisfaction do not uniformly precede the onset of PMD. Further, the relative absence of antecedent social or environmental events in PMD suggests a more specific role for hormonal events in the triggering of PMD. Preliminary findings from this longitudinal study also suggest that declining adrenal androgens (i.e., dehydroepiandrosterone) and progesterone-derived neurosteroids (i.e., allopregnanolone) could contribute to this risk for PMD. Fifteen additional women should complete this study over the next 1-2 years and at that time we will be better able to characterize the roles of these hormones in the risk for PMD.A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiols antidepressant efficacy in PMD. Additionally, we have completed a subsequent placebo-controlled study examining the effects on mood and behavior in women with PMD of estradiol and two compounds: the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), raloxifene and a phytoestrogen (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds). In this study we replicated our previous findings that estradiol therapy is effective in the treatment of PMD; however, neither raloxifene nor the phytoestrogen showed significant effects on symptoms in PMD. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop PMD. In our hormone manipulation studies, we evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with and those without a past PMD. In this study, asymptomatic postmenopausal women who experienced a depression during the menopause transition and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no past depression received a standard dose of estradiol (100 mcg per day). After three weeks all women were randomly assigned under double-blind (DB) conditions to either continue estradiol or switch to placebo (estradiol withdrawal). If estradiol withdrawal was a relevant physiologic event to trigger depression, then one would predict that depressive symptoms would develop in those women randomized to placebo. Additionally, if women who develop depression during the perimenopause are differentially susceptible to the mood destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal, then mood symptoms should emerge in the women with past PMD but not the controls randomized to DB placebo.Results demonstrate that estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with past PMD (n = 26), but not in those without such a history (n = 30).  Women with past PMD (but not those without past PMD) who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo (i.e., estradiol withdrawal) experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity. Women with past PMD who continued on estradiol and all control women remained asymptomatic. Importantly, women with past PMD and control women had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during placebo and, therefore, neither differences in hot-flushes (and the attendant sleep-disturbance) nor peripheral estradiol levels account for the differential response to estradiol withdrawal. In women with past PMD, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. These data also suggest that women with a history of PMD should be alert to the risk of recurrent depression when discontinuing hormone therapy. In collaboration with David Goldmans laboratory at NIAAA, we are investigating the effects of estradiol withdrawal on gene expression (whole transcriptome RNA-seq) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained from women with past PMD and controls who had the presence and absence, respectively, of estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms confirmed in the clinical study. These studies are performed before and after estradiol withdrawal in LCLs derived from women with past perimenopausal depression (PMD). The goal is to understand possible cellular basis for the differential behavioral response to estradiol withdrawal that was previously demonstrated in our hormone manipulation protocol. Preliminary findings of differential gene expression revealed 534 significant differential gene expression changes between women with past PMD and those with no past PMD after E2 withdrawal, as well as several molecular pathways that appear to be differentially altered in women with PMD. Of these genes, two are of particular interest in PMD: the gene CXCL10, which has been previously linked to cardiovascular disease, is significantly upregulated in women with PMD and the gene CYP7B1, an enzyme which is responsible for the metabolism of the steroids DHEA and pregnenolone (as well as oxysterols, bile acid metabolites with actions on the brain), is also significantly upregulated in women with PMD. Finally, in a recent FDA-approved protocol, we will explore whether the estradiol withdrawal signal is mediated by ER alpha or beta (or both) by employing a selective ER beta agonist. These data could identify a promising new class of therapeutic agents that are safer and more acceptable than estrogen and potentially lack the side effects or withdrawal syndromes associated with traditional psychotropics. Additionally, it is possible that the selectivity of these compounds for estrogen receptor alpha and beta may identify the mechanisms of efficacy of estradiol on specific target symptoms.',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have completed a number of studies on the pathogenesis of Strongyloidiasis and LF and the immunology of tuberculosis. We are also continuing our studies on TB - helminth co-infection and immune responses in TB and TB-diabetes.Strongyloidiasis and LF pathogenesis:A. Elevated Systemic Levels Of Eosinophil, Neutrophil And Mast Cell Granular Proteins In Strongyloides Stercoralis Infection That Diminish Following TreatmentInfection with the helminth parasite Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) is commonly clinically asymptomatic that is often accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia. Granulocytes are activated during helminth infection and can act as immune effector cells. Plasma levels of eosinophil and neutrophil granular proteins provide an indirect measure of granulocyte degranulation and are markedly increased in many helminth-infected patients. We sought to examine the levels of eosinophil, neutrophil and mast cell activation-associated granule proteins in asymptomatic Ss infection and to understand their kinetics following anthelmintic therapy. To this end, we measured the plasma levels of eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil derived neurotoxin, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil major basic protein, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil proteinase-3, mast cell tryptase, leukotriene C4 and mast cell carboxypeptidase-A3 in individuals with asymptomatic Ss infection (INF) or without Ss infection (UN). We also measured the levels of all of these analytes in infected individuals following definitive treatment of Ss infection. We show that INF individuals have significantly higher plasma levels of eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil derived neurotoxin, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil major basic protein, elastase, myeloperoxidase, mast cell tryptase, leukotriene C4 and carboxypeptidase-A3 compared to UN individuals. Following treatment of Ss infection, each of these granulocyte-associated proteins drop significantly. Our data suggest that eosinophil, neutrophil and mast cell activation may play a role in the response to Ss infection.B. Elevated Systemic And Parasite  Antigen Stimulated Levels Of Type III IFNs In A Chronic Helminth Infection And Reversal Following Anthelmintic TreatmentType III IFNs are important players in immunity to viral and bacterial infections. However, their association with helminth infections has not been examined. To explore the association of Type III IFNs with Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infection, we examined the systemic levels of IL-28A, IL-28B, IL-29 in Ss infected (INF, n=44), helminth  uninfected (UN, n=44) and in post treatment INF individuals. We also examined the levels of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 in whole blood culture supernatants stimulated with Ss somatic antigens or LPS. Finally, we performed correlations of systemic Type III IFN levels with absolute numbers of dendritic cells subsets. Ss infection is characterized by elevated systemic levels of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 in comparison to UN individuals and a significant reduction following anthelmintic treatment. Ss infection is also characterized by elevated levels of unstimulated or Ss antigen stimulated levels of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 and a significant reduction following treatment. In addition, Ss infection is  characterized by increased numbers of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells in comparison to UN individuals, with a significant reduction following anthelmintic treatment of INF individuals. Finally, Ss infection exhibits a significant positive correlation between the systemic levels of IL-28A and IL-28B and the numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Thus, Ss infection is characterized by elevations in systemic and antigen  induced levels of Type III IFNs, which is positively associated with the numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and reversed upon anthelmintic treatment. Tuberculosis Studies:A. Coexistent helminth infection mediated modulation of chemokine responses in latent tuberculosisCoexistent helminth infections are known to modulate T cell and cytokine responses in latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, their role in modulating chemokine responses in latent tuberculosis (LTB) has not been explored. Since, chemokines play a vital role in the protective immune responses in LTB, we postulated that coexistent helminth infection could modulate chemokine production in helminth-LTB co-infection. To test this, we measured the levels of a panel of CC and CXC chemokines at baseline and following mycobacterial-antigen or mitogen stimulation in individuals with latent tuberculosis with (Ss+LTB+) or without Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) (Ss-LTB+) infection and in individuals without both infections (HC). At baseline, Ss +LTB+ individuals exhibited significantly diminished production of CCL1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 in comparison to Ss-LTB+ and/or HC individuals. Upon mycobacterial stimulation, Ss+LTB+ individuals exhibited significantly diminished production of CCL1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL10 in comparison to Ss-LTB+ and/or HC individuals. Upon mitogen stimulation, Ss+LTB+ did not exhibit any significant differences in chemokine production in comparison to the other groups. Finally, after anthelmintic treatment, the baseline levels of CCL1, CCL2, CCL4, CCL11 and CXCL11 and mycobacterial-antigen stimulated levels of CCL1, CCL2, CCL11, CXCL2 and CXCL10 were significantly increased in Ss+LTB+ individuals. Thus, our data demonstrate that Ss+LTB+ individuals are associated with a compromised ability to express both CC and CXC chemokines and that this defect is at least partially reversible upon treatment. Hence, coexistent helminth infection induces down modulation of chemokine responses in LTB individuals, with likely potential effects on TB pathogenesis. B. Tuberculous lymphadenitis is associated with altered levels of circulating angiogenic factors Angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang) are important in granuloma formation and serve as biomarkers in pulmonary tuberculosis. The association of these angiogenic factors in tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) has not been explored. Hence, our study examined the association of VEGF and Ang family molecules in TBL. We measured the systemic levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, Ang-1, Ang-2 and TIE2 levels in TBL and latent TB individuals (LTB). Similarly, we also examined VEGF-A, VEGF-C and Ang-2 levels in the lymph node (LN) culture supernatants of the same TBL individuals. The circulating levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C were significantly diminished, whereas VEGF-R2, R3, Ang-2 and TIE2 levels were significantly elevated in TBL. Likewise, VEGF-A, VEGF-C and Ang-2 levels were significantly elevated in LN supernatants when compared to plasma levels in TBL individuals. ROC analysis revealed VEGF-C and VEGF-R2 markers clearly distinguished TBL from LTB. Following chemotherapy, VEGF-C and Ang-1 levels were significantly altered. No association was observed for angiogenic factors compared with culture grade and lymph node (LN) size, except for VEGF-A. Also, TBL VEGF-A levels were significantly decreased in multiple LN when compared with single LN. Our data reveals that altered levels of circulating angiogenic factors in TBL might reflect underlying vasculo-endothelial dysfunction. Reversal of angiogenic markers after anti-TB treatment reveals that these angiogenic markers may serve as biomarkers of disease severity or response to chemotherapy in TBL.',\n",

The HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a member of the retroviral familywhich is the major etiological agent involved in the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS). The World Health Organization now estimates that in 2016 over 40 million people worldwide areinfected. There are a number of potential targets in the HIV life cycle including HIV reverse transcriptase (RT),HIV protease, and more recently viral entry, attachment, and integration. Drugs targeting RT remain acornerstone of AIDS therapy in most therapeutic regimens. The drugs that target HIV-1 RT are divided into twoclasses: nucleoside inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs). Rapid development of drugresistance by the error prone RT, side effects, and issues of viral vs host polymerase selectivity necessitate thediscovery of more effective NRTIs and NNRTIs with improved safety, pharmacological, and drug resistanceprofiles. Building on the discovery of a potent novel lead compound, using computationally and structure-guided design, the PI and collaborators used lead optimization to develop new NNRTIs have excellent potencyon WT and drug resistant strains of HIV, optimal pharmacological properties, and synergy with clinicallyrelevant NRTIs.

       " 'Abstract: The vast majority of Plasmodium falciparum infections are either asymptomatic (creating a reservoir for ongoing transmission) or lead to an uncomplicated febrile illness. Only a small proportion of infections progress to life-threatening malaria disease. The relative contributions of the malaria parasite and the human host to this disease severity spectrum have not been well described. This project will establish two cohorts of children to investigate factors that influence the dynamics of infection progression. One cohort will identify subjects at both ends of the disease severity spectrum (cerebral malaria patients with retinopathy and increased brain volume at the severe end, and participants that have remained asymptomatically infected for two months at the mild end) to compare factors that lead to differences in disease severity; the other cohort will capture children transitioning from asymptomatic malaria infection to malaria disease. Both sets of clinical samples will be used to test four hypotheses; two related to parasite characteristics (the speed of replication and the genetic complexity of the infection), and two related to the human host (the intensity of the inflammatory response and the antibody responses to a family of proteins, the variable surface antigens). Using the two comparison groups and these four hypotheses, we will be able to gain new insights into the possible causes of the different outcomes of malaria infection. These insights should not only aid in designing new treatments for those children suffering from severe disease, but could also help in planning for interventions that will eliminate infection from the asymptomatically-infected children contributing to the transmission reservoir.',\n",
       " \"During the current reporting period we have focused on 3 major projects:1)\\tGenetics of Scleroderma in the African-American PopulationThrough a collaborative group denoted GRASP (Genome Research in African American Scleroderma Patients), we have secured the largest collection of African-American SSc patients ever assembled. GRASP consists of 23 centers outside of the NIH. With help from the Scleroderma Research Foundation, we have collected DNA samples from 1170 African-American SSc patients, and we have identified 1039 antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative African-American controls provided by Charles Rotimi. Phenotypic characteristics of the GRASP cohort were summarized in the report from the previous reporting period and were published during the current reporting period. Consistent with the underlying assumptions of this study, GRASP patients exhibited more severe phenotypes than a control European ancestry cohort. 1008 SSc patients and 1008 SSc controls have been genotyped on 2 Illumina GWAS arrays. We have completed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 400 patients and 482 controls. Variants identified in the discovery phase by GWAS and WES are now undergoing sequencing in a replication study of 600 SSc patients and 360 controls.The Illumina MEGA array was used to genotype 934 patients and 946 controls to conduct the first GWAS of SSc in African Americans. A total of 1.7 million variants were genotyped and after quality control filtering 1.4 million variants remained and were imputed into the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 v5 reference panel. Admixture and principal component analysis confirmed that the patients and controls were well-matched. GWAS identified class II genes as the strongest risk factor in SSc susceptibility and discovered two non-HLA, African ancestry-specific loci, IFT43/TGFB3 and FSD2/HOMER2. rs35915063 was the top scoring variant in the HLA-DQB1 gene (P=2.2 x 10e-17, OR=1.96). Stepwise conditional regression analysis using an additive model revealed the DQA1 variant rs9271620 and the DPB1 variant rs2071354 as independent risk variants. Upon performing eQTL analysis in whole blood from the GTEx RNA sequencing data, the African-American SSc-associated alleles of these 3 risk variants were associated with increased expression of HLA-DQB2/DQA2 and decreased expression of HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes. rs59063398 showed the strongest non-MHC association (P=2.0 x 10e-8, OR=0.47). This variant is part of an evolutionarily conserved haploblock in the IFT43 gene region that is African ancestry-specific. On performing eQTL analysis of the GTEx RNA sequencing data of sun-exposed skin of the lower leg, we observed decreased expression of TGFB3 associated with the minor variant in the IFT43/TGFB3 region (P=0.02). We used MHC region genotypes from the MEGA array to impute classical HLA types and analyzed their associations with scleroderma in the GRASP cohort. We extracted the genotypes of 25,256 markers from 20 Mb encompassing the greater MHC region to impute classical HLA types using the HLA*IMP:03 web server. The most significantly SSc-associated HLA type was a predominantly African allele, HLA-DRB1*08:04, OR=2.95. Regression analysis conditioning on the disease-associated alleles identified another African DRB1 allele, *11:02, as well as HLA-DPB1*13:01 and HLA-DRB4*01:01 as independent contributors to disease risk, but no association was found for MHC class I alleles. 34.6 percent of GRASP cases carry either DRB1*08:04 or *11:02 compared with 16.3 percent of controls. On stratifying the SSc samples by autoantibodies, very strong and specific HLA allele associations were identified, with HLA-DRB1*0804 increasing risk by 7.2-fold in the anti-fibrillarin antibody subset of African-American SSc and HLA-DPB1*1301 increasing risk by 4.1-fold in the anti-topoisomerase I antibody subset. In the anti-topoisomerase I antibody subset of SSc patients of European ancestry, HLA-DPB1*1301 increased SSc risk by 12.5-fold.2)\\tGenetic and Immunologic Studies of PFAPAPFAPA is the most common periodic fever syndrome in children. Patients present with recurrent episodes of high fever with pharyngitis, cervical adenitis, and aphthous ulcers with regular timing. Tonsillectomy is curative in most patients. In order to untangle the mechanism of PFAPA, we are studying the immunologic features of tonsils and genetic variants linked to the disease.We studied the cellular profile of tonsils removed from children with PFAPA during an asymptomatic interval and compared them with tonsils from children with obstructive sleep apnea and with structural oropharyngeal disorders without tonsil pathology. By flow-cytometry, we found fewer T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, increased T follicular regulatory cells, fewer plasma cells and IgG class switching, and increased numbers of NK cells. Gene expression analysis of sorted tonsillar CD4+ T cells by Nanostring revealed increased expression of genes associated with Th1 cell activation in patients with PFAPA. Sorted tonsillar myeloid cells, on the other hand, showed depressed expression of genes involved in innate immune pathway signaling.We also screened 141 Caucasian patients with PFAPA for single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with another ulcerative disorder, Behcet's disease. We found that a variant upstream of IL12A was strongly associated with PFAPA (OR=2.06, p=6x10e-7), compared with Caucasian controls from the gnoMAD database. IL12A encodes the p35 subunit of both the inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, and the inhibitory cytokine, IL-35. We hypothesize that patients with PFAPA and this variant have heightened production of IL-12 and IL-35 during the activation and resolution phases of the disease, respectively, leading to excess Th1 polarization and germinal center activation during fever flares, and germinal center and myeloid cell suppression during asymptomatic periods between flares as we find in the tonsils. We believe that this cycling between states of heightened immune activation and suppression lead to the regular timing of episodes in this disease. Functional studies of monocytes from patients with and without the IL12A variant and comparison of cells and cytokines during flare and non-flare periods are underway to test these hypotheses.3)\\tTrisomy 8-Associated Autoinflammatory DiseaseWe have characterized inflammatory symptoms in a cohort of approximately 50 patients with constitutional trisomy 8 mosaicism or chromosome 8 duplication; nearly half have mucosal ulcerations and 40% have recurrent stereotypical fevers.  Mucosal ulcerations are often large and persist for over one week and may be present in the genital or gastrointestinal tract in addition to the mouth.  Affected patients have elevated expression of TLR, NF-kappaB, and IL-1-related genes in their whole blood, suggesting activation of myeloid cells.  We have also found that CD14+ monocytes in affected patients have a significantly higher percentage of chromosome 8 mosaicism in comparison to B and T cells (copy number of chromosome 8 genes is 2.69 in CD14+ cells vs. 2.48 in CD19+ cells vs. 2.27 in CD3+, p = 0.01 for CD14+ vs. CD19+ and p=0.001 for CD14+ vs. CD3+), suggesting that myeloid cells with trisomy 8 are afforded a survival advantage in addition to exhibiting excess activation.  We have treated two patients with anakinra and one with etanercept with significant improvement in symptoms.  We are continuing to study the functional effects of trisomy 8 on survival and cytokine production in monocytes.  We also plan to assess the frequency of trisomy 8 mosaicism and chromosome 8 duplications among a cohort of patients with Behcet's disease.\",\n",
       " 'SummaryWhat we eat greatly impacts how our physiology and affects our propensity to get diseases such asobesity and diabetes. The bacteria that inhabit our intestine, our gut microbiota, greatly influencenumerous physiological traits, including our nutritional intake, and also affect our response totherapeutic drugs. A major goal of biomedical research is to uncover the interplay between dietarynutrients and metabolites plus resident microbiota and the subsequent affect on our physiology. Inaddition, a major challenge is to dissect the mechanisms by which bacteria modulate the response totherapeutic drugs. We have developed an innovative interspecies systems biology model of thenematode C. elegans and its bacterial diet to address these questions. We have used this model touncover bacterially derived micronutrients and metabolites that affect gene expression, developmentand fertility in the worm, and to identify a C. elegans metabolic regulatory network that mediates theresponse to bacterial nutrients. In addition, we have discovered mechanisms by which bacteriamodulate the C. elegans response to several chemotherapeutic drugs. In the next project we use ourdemonstrated strength to investigate the effects of bacteria both broadly, in systems-level surveysand screens, and deeply with targeted mechanistic experiments. We will connect bacterialmetabolism to host physiology and gene expression as well as the response to a variety oftherapeutic drugs. The data obtained will provide an important stepping stone toward understandinghow the microbiota can modulate human physiology in terms of nutrition and the response toxenobiotic compounds such as therapeutic drugs. This work, therefore, has long-term implications fornutrition, toxicology, as well as personalized and precision medicine.',\n",
       " 'Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a complication of serious infections and trauma and animportant source of morbidity and mortality in Veterans and the general population. Despite improvementsin supportive care, no pharmaceutical therapies have been developed and mortality remains over 40%.Although preclinical studies support pharmacologic inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) to treat a range of inflammatory diseases, including ARDS, the currently available p38 inhibitorshave had limited success in clinical trials due to toxicity and poor efficacy. Since these agents are catalyticsite inhibitors, they block all p38 activity. Most of these inhibitors target multiple p38 isoforms, even thoughp38α is the only isoform required for inflammatory responses and other isoforms can be cytoprotective.Furthermore, since p38α itself also regulates anti-inflammatory and counterregulatory genes via Mitogen-and Stress-activated Protein Kinase (MSK)-1/2, we believe that targeting the catalytic site is an intrinsical-ly flawed strategy.We used computer-aided drug design (CADD) to identify novel small molecules that target the glutamate-aspartate (ED) substrate docking site, which is required for phosphorylation of MAPK-activated proteinkinase-2 (MK2), a p38α substrate known to mediate inflammation, endothelial barrier function, andleukocyte mobility; whereas MSK1/2 binds to the c o m m o n d o c k i n g ( CD) site. Using this strategy, weidentified p38α-binding compounds, including a lead compound, UM101, which selectively binds theCADD-targeted pocket in p38α, but not p38β. UM101 stabilizes human lung microvascular endothelial(HMVECL) barrier function, and inhibits LPS-induced proinflammatory gene expression in THP1 cells.UM101 is also well-tolerated and more potent than the prototypical p38 catalytic inhibitor, SB203580, inmitigating LPS-induced lung inflammation and permeability pulmonary edema in mice. RNASeq andIngenuity Pathway Analysis showed that UM101 inhibited only some SB203580-inhibitable genes, butspared others including MSK1/2-dependent anti-inflammatory genes. Preliminary phosphopeptide analysisfailed to identify off-target effects. Three additional compounds were identified from the CADD search,which share p38a-binding and biological activity with UM101.Our central hypothesis is that targeting small molecules to p38α substrate docking sites rather than thecatalytic site will generate a spectrum of potential drugs with unique biological effects and reduced toxicityprofiles, which will be more effective in treating inflammatory diseases. The objectives of this proposal areto: identify additional lead compounds with improved anti-inflammatory and endothelial barrier stabilizingactivity, analyze their function and mechanism of action, and analyze toxicity and efficacy of at least threelead compounds as pre- and post-treatment in a mouse LPS-induced acute lung injury model. We willidentify additional lead compounds by completing functional and mechanistic analyses of our 150 CADD-identified p38a-binding compounds. We expect to: (1) generate a series of chemically diverse, novelp38α modifiers that avoid the intrinsic flaw in currently available p38 catalytic inhibitors; (2) completesufficient functional analysis to advance the lead compounds to chemical optimization to improve drug-like properties; and ( 3 ) c o m p le t e sufficient preclinical in vivo testing to support transition to clinical trials.',\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Providing patients the right care at the right time has achieved new levels of attention in healthcare delivery. For diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, this includes ensuring proper patient selection, given that procedural benefits may not exist for some patients despite significant clinical risk and cost. The importance of proper patient selection is reflected in the efforts of the Choosing Wisely campaign and Appropriate Use Criteria that seek to reduce the use of medical tests and procedures that may be inappropriate (i.e. provide no patient benefit despite procedural risk). Few contemporary data exist on whether invasive and expensive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are used inappropriately in the VA. We seek to address this critical knowledge gap as it relates to the care of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a common and high cost clinical condition in the VA. In the care of Veterans with CAD, more than 10,000 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and 50,000 stress tests are performed annually. These procedures are appropriate in symptomatic CAD patients for diagnostic evaluation and symptom reduction. However, use of these procedures in asymptomatic CAD patients without significant ischemic or coronary disease burden is inappropriate and results in unnecessary procedural risks of myocardial infarction, bleeding, renal failure, radiation exposure, and death. Additionally, these procedures are expensive and contribute more than $200 million in healthcare expenditures annually to the VA. In pilot chart review, 1 in 10 PCI and stress tests performed in the VA for stable CAD were inappropriate, suggesting 6,000 Veterans may undergo unnecessary cardiovascular procedures at a cost of $20 million annually. The prevalence, patient risks, and expense of these procedures demand further investigation to an understanding whether they are being used for the appropriate patient populations in the VA. Furthermore, in an era where the VA is increasingly asked to do more with less, it is critical to determine if inappropriate use of these procedures is a significant contributor to unnecessary costs in low-value care. Accordingly, the fundamental goal of this proposal is to determine the extent of inappropriate use of PCI and stress tests performed in the VA for patients with CAD and whether inappropriate use is a major contributor to low-value healthcare. Informed by these analyses, we will then conduct qualitative research to identify best-practices for the delivery of appropriate and high-value care. The proposal's 3 aims will: 1) assess the rate of PCI and stress tests performed in asymptomatic patients classified as inappropriate by the Appropriate Use Criteria across the VA healthcare system and identify patient, provider, and environmental factors associated with inappropriate use; 2) determine the extent of variation in healthcare value that is attributable to inappropriate use of PCI and stresstests in asymptomatic patients; and 3) identify best-practices for appropriate procedural use and high-value healthcare through key informant interviews at outlier hospitals as determined by rates of inappropriate use and costs relative to patient outcomes. We will answer these questions in a cohort of 20,000 patients with CAD identified at coronary angiography performed between 2011 and 2013 using data from the VA National Clinical Assessment Reporting and Tracking (CART) Program linked to VA administrative data sources. Among CAD patients who undergo subsequent PCI and stress tests after PCI, we will complete chart review to determine procedural appropriateness while concurrently developing methods to allow prospective appropriateness measurement. In the determination of healthcare value following the diagnosis of CAD, we will include overall costs of care and clinical outcomes of mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction. In the future, this proposal's findings will directly enhance Veterans' careby 1) providing strategies to achieve appropriate and high-value care for patients with CAD and 2) serving as a model to address other areas of high-utilization, high-cost care delivery.\",\n",
       " 'Project 1: Mothes – Conformational events underlying HIV-1 envelope antagonismSUMMARYThe HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is the sole viral protein exposed on the virus surface and as suchrepresents a main target for entry inhibitors and vaccines to treat HIV-1/AIDS. A major barrier in targeting HIV-1 Env has been the conformational flexibility that conceals functional centers. We have developed single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) methods to directly visualize the conformationalstates and structural dynamics of HIV-1 Envs in the context of the native trimer on the surface of HIV virions.Our results revealed that the functional Env trimer exists primarily in a closed conformation (State 1), but hasinherent access to the open CD4-bound conformation (State 3) through one necessary asymmetric trimerintermediate (State 2). When we asked how the existing high-resolution structures relate to the statesobserved by smFRET, we discovered that they all correspond to either State 2 or 3. The all-important structureof State 1 of HIV-1 Env, which is the target of the majority of broadly neutralizing antibodies, remains unknown.Going forward, an understanding of the structure of State 1 will be critical as this is the conformation that mostsmall molecule inhibitors will first engage. To this end, we will use smFRET to guide the field towardsexperimental conditions that permit a structural characterization of State 1. Defining conformational states ofnative Env trimers will also provide a mechanistic framework for how small molecule inhibitors developed bythis Program antagonize Env. Conformational blockers specifically bind to State 1 and prevent the adoption ofthe CD4-bound conformation. In contrast, CD4 mimics shift the conformational landscape towards the moreopen State 2 and 3 conformations. Applied to new compounds development by this Program Project, smFRETwill continue to reveal conformation selectivity, determine conformational trajectories and lead to mechanisticinsights into irreversible Env inactivation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which compoundsinhibit, prematurely activate or drive HIV-1 envelope off-pathway will guide the rational design of new classesof inhibitors.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYProtein homeostasis (proteostasis) and reduction-oxidation (redox) balance are two tightly regulated andmutually associated molecular events. They play crucial roles in many physiological/pathological conditionsincluding cancer. Disruption of proteostasis and redox balance is an effective approach to selectively killcancer cells. For examples, proteasome inhibitors such as Bortezomib (Velcade) are highly effective intreating numerous cancers, and autophagy inhibitors are being actively pursued as anti-cancer therapeutics.Many clinically effective chemotherapeutic agents such as arsenic trioxide can induce oxidative burst and celldeath, which is believed to contribute, at least in part, to their anti-cancer effectiveness. On the other hand,dysregulated proteostasis and redox homeostasis can contribute to oncogenesis by activating numerous pro-survival/growth signaling pathways. The seemingly paradoxical effects (pro- and anti-cancer) are generallythought to be accounted for by the intensity and duration of the stresses, although the precise underlyingmechanisms remain largely elusive. The ubiquitin-binding protein, p62 (SQSTM1), among its numerousfunctions, critically regulates both proteostasis and redox balance, by sequestering certain proteins inaggregates and delivering them to autophagosomes for degradation. This sequestration function of p62 relieson its dimmerization via the hydrogen bond between lysine (K)7 and aspartate (D)69 residues. We recentlyreported that TRIM21 (Tripartite motif-containing protein 21), a RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase,directly interacts with and ubiquitylates p62 at K7 via K63-linkage, which abolishes the K7-D69 hydrogen bondand inhibits p62 oligomerization, aggregation, and sequestration functions. One of the client proteinssequestered by p62 is Keap1, a negative regulator of the antioxidant response that suppresses the antioxidanttranscription factor Nrf2. TRIM21-mediated p62 K7 ubiquitylation leads to the failure of Keap1 sequestrationand suppressed antioxidant response. Conversely, TRIM21-deficient cells display increased p62oligomerization, protein aggregation, Keap1 sequestration, Nrf2 activation, and antioxidant response. In thisproject, we propose to study the hypothesis that TRIM21 functions as a stress-adaptation molecule and plays acrucial role in proteostasis and redox homeostasis, by ubiquitylating p62 and negatively regulating itssequestration function, for the underlying mechanisms and biological significance, with a main focus on anti-cancer therapy and oncogenesis. As TRIM21 expression is dysregulated and correlates with prognosis innumerous cancers, accomplishing this project will uncover TRIM21 as a new important regulator for cellularproteostasis and redox homeostasis, and will help reveal the role of TRIM21 in cancer development andtherapy.',\n",
       " 'Activating Multiorgan Antioxidative Gene Network for Treating SepsisABSTRACTDespite more than three decades of extensive research, sepsis remains the chief cause of death in intensivecare units. Currently, there is no specific treatment for sepsis. Thus, it is imperative to develop effectivetherapies for managing this dread disorder. The exact pathophysiology of sepsis remains to be elucidated. It isthought that sepsis is the culmination of complex interactions between the infecting microorganisms and thehost inflammatory cells, leading to dysregulated inflammation, multiple organ failure, and death. In this context,substantial studies support a causal role for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and theconsequent oxidative/inflammatory stress in the development and progression of multiple organ injury in sepsisin both animals and humans. However, exogenous antioxidant-based therapies have been unsuccessfulpossibly due to their limited ability to scavenge ROS/RNS and counteract oxidative/inflammatory stress. Ascoordinated actions of a series of endogenous Nrf2-regulated antioxidative/anti-inflammatory (AO/AI) enzymesare essential for efficient detoxification of ROS/RNS in target organs, we propose a novel strategy to treatsepsis via activating the endogenous Nrf2-regulated AO/AI gene network in multiple vital organs. Our long-term objective is to develop an innovative mechanistically-based effective modality targeting multiple vitalorgans to treat sepsis. The central hypothesis of this R15 application is that the simultaneous coordinatedactivation of the Nrf2-regulated AO/AI gene network in multiple organs by the novel Nrf2-activating agent, 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) is an innovative and highly effective therapeutic strategy to protect againstoxidative/inflammatory stress and multiorgan dysfunction and failure in experimental sepsis. This hypothesis issupported by our preliminary studies showing a nearly complete protection by D3T against endotoxemia-induced mortality in mice. Accordingly, the specific aims of this R15 proposal are designed to systematically(1) investigate the upregulation of endogenous AO/AI defenses by D3T in multiple organs, including the heart,lung, liver, kidney, and intestine, and the underlying signaling mechanisms in mice; (2) determine thetherapeutic effects of D3T-induced multiorgan AO/AI defenses in the pathophysiological process of LPS-induced endotoxemia and the signaling mechanisms in mice; and (3) investigate the therapeutic effects ofD3T-induced multiorgan AO/AI defenses in the pathophysiological process of polymicrobial sepsis induced bycecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and the signaling mechanisms in mice. The proposed studies will providenovel insights into the molecular basis of pharmacological activation of multiorgan AO/AI genes to protectagainst multiple organ dysfunction and failure in sepsis and will contribute to the development of an effectiveD3T-based therapeutic modality targeting Nrf2-regulated multiorgan AO/AI genes to treat human sepsis. Thisproject is well within the PI’s extensive research and student training expertises, and will provide a uniqueopportunity for training additional undergraduate students doing innovative research at the PI’s institution.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACTAs a recently appointed tenure-track Assistant Professor of Public Health, my long-term career goal is to makea meaningful contribution to the elimination of cancer disparities. In doing this, I wish to establish myself as anationally-recognized independent investigator with expertise in the use of health communication to addresscancer disparities. I have substantial training in behavioral research, primarily focused on understanding the roleof various social and cultural factors on cancer disparities. Building on this foundation, I require additional trainingto fill gaps related to the design, implementation, and evaluation of health communication interventions. MyMentorship Team and I have prepared a comprehensive career development plan that consists of mentorship,coursework, expert consultations, workshops, experiential learning, and an innovative research project. Myproposed research plan aligns with my overarching career goal in seeking to improve routine cancer screeningwithin federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), where the burden of cancer is greater compared to the generalpopulation, but screening rates are much lower than national averages. Despite the significant contribution ofroutine screening in the reduction of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality,disparities persist among racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic (SES) populations who continue tounderutilize screening. FQHCs can be invaluable partners in reducing these disparities due to their sliding-feepay structure and location in medically underserved areas. The goal of the proposed K01 research project is tounderstand how current FQHC users perceive routine asymptomatic cancer screening, and develop and pre-test an eHealth tool that promotes screening among FQHC users. The specific aims are to: (1) Conduct formativeresearch with FQHC users to understand how they perceive and make decisions about routine asymptomaticcancer screening; (2) Design and pre-test an eHealth tool that addresses each domain of the health literacyframework, and incorporates key decision criteria of asymptomatic cancer screening among FQHC users; and(3) Pilot test an eHealth intervention within an FQHC setting aimed at delivering literacy appropriate, “decision-relevant” information about routine asymptomatic cancer screening to FQHC users. This Mentored ResearchAward would provide the necessary protected time to achieve the following training goals: (1) Develop expertisein the application of decision analysis to health communication, within a health literacy framework; (2) Becomefamiliar with clinic operations, user profiles, and service delivery within FQHCs, along with successful researchcollaboration with FQHCs; (3) Build competence in health communication intervention design, implementation,and evaluation; and (4) Develop the necessary skills to translate communication research into practice,specifically within an FQHC setting. This research would set the stage for a larger R01-level healthcommunication intervention study. Findings might inform not only cancer screening, but also other healthpromotion interventions in FQHCs, which are increasingly becoming medical homes for low SES populations.',\n",

       " \"PROJECT 3 - SUMMARY/ABSTRACTAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder caused by interactions among multiplegenetic and environmental factors. Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 increases the risk and lowers the age of onset forAD in a gene dose-dependent manner. Remarkably, the lifetime risk estimate of developing AD for individualswith 2 copies of the apoE4 allele (~2% of the population) is ~70% by the age of 85. By comparison, the lifetimeAD risk estimate for individuals with two copies of the apoE3 allele is ~10% by the age of 85. Although many ofthe apoE4 homozygotes develop early-onset AD (EOAD) or late-onset AD (LOAD), some of them (~20%) stayasymptomatic over age 85. Understanding the susceptibility of the former group and the resistance of the lattergroup to AD might allow for the development of strategies to prevent or delay AD in people at risk.Like AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is also a multifactorial and heterogeneous neurodegenerativedisorder. About 20-50% of FTD cases are inherited, and heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN)gene are one of the most common causes of the inherited forms of FTD. However, homozygous PGRNmutations unexpectedly cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) rather than FTD. Understanding how thesame mutation within a single PGRN gene causes different phenotypes depending on gene dose is crucial forunraveling the pathogenesis of both FTD and NCL and for their therapeutic developments.Because neurons cannot be obtained directly from patients, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derivedfrom AD or FTD patients hold great promise as in vitro models for studying disease pathogenesis in humanneurons. This proposal aims to capitalize on this promise by building on our previous efforts to generate a well-characterized repository of human iPSC (hiPSC) lines from AD and FTD patients and, by using them, to studydisease phenotypes, reveal novel mechanisms, and identify new therapeutic targets. The goals of this projectare to address the following two questions: (1) why are many apoE4 homozygotes vulnerable to ADpathogenesis at young ages when others (~20%) can stay asymptomatic by age 85 and over? (2) How doheterozygous and homozygous mutations within a single PGRN gene cause different clinical phenotypes, i.e.,FTD and NCL, respectively? To answer these questions, we will compare the phenotypic differences (e.g., Aβproduction/secretion and tau phosphorylation/fragmentation) among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSClines from EOAD patients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 1); determine thetranscriptomic and proteomic differences among neurons derived from apoE4/4-hiPSC lines from EOADpatients, LOAD patients, and asymptomatic controls at different ages (Aim 2); and explore the underlyingmechanisms by which heterozygous PGRN mutations cause FTD but homozygous PGRN mutations causeNCL (Aim 3). These studies should significantly accelerate AD and FTD research and related therapeuticdevelopment by enhancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels.\",\n",
       " 'Project Summary/AbstractCholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic inover 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewedglobal effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided bynew generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guidethese activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting withinfrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poorsurveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildlysymptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detectionof immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimatesof cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters aremost predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicityare similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data fromcholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibodyresponse kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statisticaland machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure toVibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time sinceexposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographicdata using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify theantibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we willcollect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to developmodels for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable usto compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we willoptimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of driedblood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using thesemethods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools formeasure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform choleracontrol efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to diseaseelimination.',\n",
       " 'Carcinoid tumors are rare and cause either no or few nonspecific symptoms.  Therefore, patients with carcinoid tumors most often present late in the course of their illness when there is already progression to an incurable state as a result of metastatic disease.  At present there are neither practical population screening tests nor effective therapies and hence the 5 year survival rate is low.  Due to the rareness of sporadic carcinoid tumors, large scale genetic analysis and development of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests have not been successful.  While kindreds with familial carcinoid tumors that are not ascribable to known genetic syndromes are exceedingly rare, they provide a unique opportunity to facilitate the identification of the responsible gene mutation.  In addition, the mutated gene in the rare familial form may also underlie the origin of the more common sporadic occurrence of carcinoid tumors.  We propose to study families in which there are at least two known affected members with carcinoid tumors. We aim to diagnose patients with early and therefore potentially curable occult disease. Therefore, family members who have up to a 50% lifetime risk of harboring a carcinoid tumor will undergo an intensive diagnostic evaluation using biochemical, endoscopic and imaging modalities at initial and subsequent two year follow up encounters.  Early phenotypic assignment of affected family members and collection of germline and tumoral DNA from multiple kindreds should also facilitate the genetic analysis leading to the identity of the disease gene.  Evaluation of affected family members at varying stages of disease will contribute to our understanding of the natural history of carcinoid tumors and the relative utility of a variety of diagnostic and surveillance tests. Hopefully, such knowledge gained will also be applicable to patients with carcinoid tumors occurring sporadically or in the setting of other familial cancer syndromes.  Thus far, we have found that familial and sporadic carcinoids are clinically indistinguishable except for the multiple synchronous primary tumors observed in most familial cases. Nearly 34% of asymptomatic relatives older than age 50 were found to have occult tumors; these tumors could be cleared surgically from 87% of these individuals (20 of 23). In one large family, linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing identified a germline 4-bp deletion in the gene inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which truncates the protein. This mutation was detected in all 11 individuals with small intestinal carcinoids and in 17 of 35 family members whose carcinoid status was unknown. Mutant IPMK had reduced kinase activity and nuclear localization, compared with the full-length protein. This reduced activation of p53 and increased cell survival. In summary, we found that small intestinal carcinoids can occur as an inherited autosomal dominant disease. The familial form is characterized by multiple synchronous primary tumors, which might account for 22%-35% of cases previously considered sporadic. Relatives of patients with familial carcinoids should be screened to detect curable early stage disease. IPMK haploinsufficiency promotes carcinoid tumorigenesis. We continue to enroll and screen new families and apply linkage analysis and WES to identify other susceptibility genes, follow surgically treated patients for recurrent disease and screen carriers for emergence of occult tumor. As a result, we now follow 95 families and have evaluated 373 inpatients, including 104 previously diagnosed and 269 asymptomatic relatives of which 57 (20%) screened positive (87% stage I-IIIB, 96% R0).Patient derived samples and mouse studies suggest that pathological stem cell dynamics in the small intestine of the +4 reserve ISC and altered stem cell dynamics of the intestinal epithelium may contribute to the development of EC derived small intestinal tumors.',\n",

       " 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders in which up to one-third of patients have overlapping clinical and pathological features. A repeat expansion mutation in the C9orf72 gene is the commonest cause of familial ALS and familial FTD in the US and also accounts for a 5-8% of ALS cases thought to be sporadic. In 2013, we began a prospective longitudinal study of persons who carry the C9orf72 mutation that includes asymptomatic carriers, patients with ALS, and patients with FTD. The first goal is to understand the natural history of C9orf72-related disease: how quickly weakness and cognitive dysfunction progress, whether clinical presentation influences survival, and whether subtle motor or cognitive abnormalities are detectable prior to the onset of definite symptoms. The second aim of the study is to explore candidate biomarkers of disease progression. Biomarkers that signal improvement or decline in disease activity before clinically evident deterioration are need for clinical trials. Imaging, physiology, and biofluids are being collected at 3 visits over 18 months. Phone surveys are conducted for 36 months. Biospecimens obtained are being shared with collaborators within and outside NIH, to facilitate translational research. Enrollment was completed in FY2018, with 50 C9orf72 mutation carriers. This included 31 patients with ALS/ALS-FTD and 15 asymptomatic carriers. To evaluate clinical progression, measures of motor, cognitive and behavioral function were obtained at baseline, and at follow-up visits at 6 and 18 months. Clinical, imaging, and physiological findings from the first half of the enrolled participants have been published. Imaging shows more extensive volume loss of extramotor areas in C9orf72 carriers with cognitive dysfunction. Ventricular enlargement and spread of white matter diffusion alterations could be detected over a 6-month period. Biospecimens were shared with collaborators at academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies, who found stable CSF levels of the repeat-associated dipeptide in longitudinal specimens, supporting its use as a pharmacodynamic marker. Collaborators found that levels of CSF phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain were predictive of survival. To examine whether oligogenic inheritance may be a factor affecting the diversity of clinical phenotypes, exome sequencing was carried out in FY18, and analysis is ongoing. Additional activities include preparation of de-identified clinical datasets for data sharing from those participants who have completed the protocol.',\n",
       " \"PROJECT SUMMARYThis is a multi-PI application for an R01 award under PAR-18-513. The proposed project titled“Combination Anti-Amyloid Therapy in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease” is a multicenter randomizedplacebo-controlled two arm clinical trial of a combination anti-amyloid therapy: an anti-fibrillar amyloidantibody for the initial 18 months combined with BACE inhibition therapy for 4 years, in preclinical AD,defined as asymptomatic individuals with elevated brain amyloid as determined by florbetapir PETscanning. The primary outcome will be a cognitive composite (a modified version of the PreclinicalAlzheimer's Cognitive Composite, PACC5), with functional and clinical assessments along withvolumetric MR and tau PET as secondary outcomes (and, in a subset, CSF biomarkers). The specificAims of the proposed study are; 1. to evaluate the impact of a combination anti-amyloid regimen onfibrillar amyloid in brain as indicated by amyloid PET SUVr, 2. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acombination anti-amyloid regimen in individuals with preclinical AD, and 3. to evaluate the impact of thecombination anti-amyloid regimen on AD biomarkers. Drs. Sperling and Aisen will share responsibilityfor scientific oversight of the clinical design and execution of the study and Imaging oversight will beprovided by Dr. Johnson. The ACTC will provide the administrative and operational support, datacapture and data management, clinical monitoring and site management, safety oversight, biostatisticalsupport, and biomarker sample processing storage and support. Final selection of therapeutic agentsfor this trial will be made by a compound selection committee composed of field experts. Committeemembership will include external experts in AD drug development and AD neurobiology, appointed inconcert with NIA. The study team will work collaboratively with the pharmaceutical companyresearchers who have clinical experience with these therapeutics in development.This will be the first study of its kind: a potentially synergistic combination approach to dramaticallyreducing amyloid from asymptomatic individuals on the AD spectrum. Combination therapy trials areincreasingly proposed by investigators and regulators to improve the likelihood of success in trialsaiming for disease-modification. This approach could ultimately prevent the onset of AD symptoms\",\n",
       " 'Abstract/Project SummaryThe prevalence of endodontic pain ranges from 32-60% for irreversible pulpitis and ~60% for cases with apicalperiodontitis. Importantly, sex-related differences have been reported in these patients. Moreover, differencesalso exist in the clinical presentation with ~40% of patients with apical periodontitis experience no pain(asymptomatic patients) despite similar radiographic presentation of bone resorption as symptomatic patients.This is an important finding as the incidence of persistent pain at 1-6 years after endodontic treatment is ashigh as 10-12% of all patients, particularly given recent concerns about non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAIDs) toxicity and opioid dependence and NIH calls for development of “personalized medicine”. Therefore,mechanisms mediating inhibition of nociception in asymptomatic patients may reveal novel factors or pathwaysthat can be activated and therefore therapeutic in symptomatic patients. We developed a clinically translational model wherein surgical biopsies collected from patientsundergoing endodontic microsurgeries undergo biochemical and functional analyses. Our preliminary datademonstrates that 1) CM from symptomatic patients (with pain) evoked significant increases in [Ca2+]i incultured TG neurons while CM from asymptomatic patients (no-pain) did not. Moreover, CM fromasymptomatic patients also desensitized CAP-evoked [Ca2+]i ; and 2) significantly greater levels of β-endorphinwas detected in asymptomatic periapical lesions compared to symptomatic periapical lesions. Based on citedliterature and our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that soluble factors released from symptomaticand asymptomatic inflamed human apical tissues differentially regulate mouse TG nociceptor activities. Totest this, we propose the following aims:Specific Aim #1 will determine the functional role of CM from asymptomatic patients on regulation ofTG neuronal activity. We will test the hypothesis that factors released from periapical lesions fromasymptomatic patients inhibit TG neuronal activity. After surgical biopsy collection, we will perform thefollowing: 1) apply CM from asymptomatic patients to mouse TG neurons to measure in vitro calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release and [Ca2+]i under basal and stimulated conditions; 2) inject CM fromasymptomatic patients in mouse vibrissal pad to evaluate in vivo spontaneous pain and mechanical allodynia;3) determine if a non-opioid inhibitory system is also present by using naloxone; 4) if evidence for a non-opioidinhibitor/s is found, determine if it is a lipid or a peptide; and 5) conduct secondary analyses to identify potentialgender-differences.Specific Aim #2 will determine the functional role of CM from symptomatic on regulation of TGneuronal activity. We will test the hypothesis that factors released from periapical lesions from symptomaticpatients will activate or sensitize TG neuronal activity. After surgical biopsy collection, we will perform thefollowing: 1) apply CM from symptomatic patients to mouse TG neurons to measure in vitro CGRP release and[Ca2+]I under basal and stimulated conditions; 2) inject CM from symptomatic patients in mouse vibrissal pad toevaluate in vivo spontaneous pain and mechanical allodynia; 3) determine if the painful soluble factor/s is alipid or a peptide; 4) conduct secondary analyses to evaluate the effect of gender-differences. Overall, we believe this application has considerable significance: 1) There is a striking variation in painresponses in endodontic patients (Nixdorf et al. 2016; Polycarpou et al. 2005); 2) Development of a clinicallytranslational model to understand differences in pain states and possible sex differences would provide afoundation for a future R01 on translational mechanisms of nociceptor regulation; 3) This knowledge base mayextend to other non-painful inflammatory conditions (e.g., asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, asymptomaticinflammatory bowel disease, asymptomatic pelvic inflammatory diseases), increasing its medical significance.',\n",
       " \"This research focuses on providing artificial intelligence (AI) systems with ways to represent knowledge about a problem domain, by creating descriptions of its observations over time. This work is important because the AI systems can transfer their knowledge from one problem domain to another, enabling them to learn complex behaviors in different environments over time. In addition, the learned representation provides a basis for creating explanations of the agent's behavior, a capability that is becoming increasingly important as AI agents are being applied to more aspects of our daily lives. The resulting learning transfer methods we will create are applicable to a wide variety of problems of interest to the broader AI community, including explainable systems, intelligent wearable computing, and robotic assistants in real world environments.The agents enabled by this work will automatically extract concepts (high-level descriptors) from perceptions, construct a hierarchy of experiences, and record learned behaviors over this structure, by extending existing reinforcement learning methods with these novel representations. Concepts serve as simple, portable, efficient packets of hierarchical knowledge that can be learned in parallel. Our novel contribution, concept-based memory, extends previous work on concept formation to identify useful properties of the domain that are not directly observable in all contexts, expanding the agent's world model and improving performance in partially observable domains. Concept-based memory provides a process for creating multi-layered abstract representations of a domain and the tasks in the domain, enabling learning transfer across multiple tasks, and providing a basis for creating explanations of learned behaviors. Our method for concept formation in reinforcement learning domains, called concept-aware feature extraction (CAFE), produces concept-lattice representations that permit knowledge learned from one task to be applied to a new problem by identifying the appropriate level of generalization for common knowledge between the tasks. We will enable scalability by integrating CAFE with abstract Markov decision processes (AMDPs) and by developing heuristic pruning methods that reduce the branching factor of the concept latticesThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " 'The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help identify people that have paroxysmal or asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias before they become dangerous. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. AF has a profound impact on longevity and quality of life. Patients typically develop paroxysmal, short-lived episodes of the arrhythmia and are frequently asymptomatic. This often leads to delays in diagnosis of AF until later stages when the arrhythmia is more persistent. Even short episodes of paroxysmal AF are associated with increased risk for stroke, heart failure, hospitalization, and death. The population with undiagnosed AF is substantial and studies have shown that continuous ECG monitoring for more than 3 years is required to achieve close to 100% AF detection. Current 30-day monitors detect 5% of paroxysmal and asymptomatic cases, since events must occur while the monitor is being worn. An armband-based approach offers a way to overcome the current restrictions in chest based monitors and bridges the gap between short-duration 30-day monitors and long-term implanted monitors.The proposed project uses an armband-based device to capture electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals on the upper arm using a waterproof and wireless device. The sensors are made from a composite material that can operate both wet and dry and does not require adhesives or hydrogels to capture all aspects of the waveforms. The challenge with the upper arm is that the ECG signals have less magnitude then over-the-heart and it is necessary to remove motion / noise artifacts as well as EMG signals to create a clean ECG signal. The research is focused on embedding algorithms into the device and testing and refining them for removing motion and noise artifacts that are captured by an accelerometer and to remove EMG signals. After a clean signal is established, proven algorithms for classification of the arrhythmias can be run embedded in the device.',\n",
       " 'Summary Despite having reduced malaria transmission to historically low level, in many Asia-Pacific countries endemic areas transmission continues and common vector control tools seem not able to interrupt transmission. The reasons for the resilience of malaria transmission are on unclear but are likely to involve not only parasite but also host and vector factors. At low transmission, asymptomatic infections account for up to 90% of infections and it they are able to transmit efficiently they could be a key component of the infectious reservoir. The only way to accurately ascertain if an infection can transmit is to feed the blood to mosquitoes and determine rate and density of infections of the mosquito midgut. Such xenodiagnostic studies are severely lacking, in particular in predominantly P. vivax endemic area. We are now proposing to conduct an in-depth dissection of the contribution of host, parasite and vector factors to maintaining malaria transmission by conducting a set studies that combine assessment of the infectivity of well characterized field samples using direct membrane feeding (DFMA) with in-depth laboratory studies in 3 sites with substantially different transmission scenarios. Initially we will investigate the relative infectivity of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections establish the association of parasite and gametocytes density with infectivity and study effect of transmission blocking immunity, vector microbiome and type parasite for gene associated with evasion of mosquito immune responses and markers of artemisinin and partner drugs resistance to determine their effect on transmission potential. As parasite and gametocyte fluctuate over time, so may their infectivity. We will therefore determine the temporal variation in infectivity an in-depth cohort study in PNG, where asymptomatic carriers will be followed for 3 weeks and mosquitoes fed every 3-4 days. Addition, we will determine proportion of pre- and post-treatment infectivity in in artemisinin-resistant and sensitive symptomatic P. falciparum. Together with our large epidemiological datasets (see Project 1), this will allow us not only clarify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission but also resistance may come with a transmission associated fitness cost, which may slow down the spread of resistance. Both human and vector behavior may limit human-vector contact in the Asia-Pacific, where vectors are frequently / predominantly outdoor biting, leading to transmission away from people’s dwelling. The low biting rate and unclear location of human-vector contact makes it difficult to identify its determinants. We will we study patterns of human vector contact by determining the presence of antibodies against salivary gland protein antibodies proteins from An. dirus. An. minimus and An. Farauti in samples from cross-sectional and cohort studies in Project 1. By providing an in-depth understanding of the transmission characteristics at each of our sites, the proposed studies will not only contribute to developing biologically accurate transmission models but will help us design better methods to track and eliminate transmission even in hard to track populations such asymptomatic carriers.']"
