       "'The hemagglutinin of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is a derivative of and is antigenically related to classical swine but not to seasonal human H1N1 viruses. We compared the A/California/7/2009 (CA/7/09) virus recommended by the WHO as the reference virus for vaccine development, with two classical swine influenza viruses A/swine/Iowa/31 (sw/IA/31) and A/New Jersey/8/1976 (NJ/76) to establish the extent of immunologic cross-reactivity and cross-protection in animal models. Primary infection with 2009 pandemic or NJ/76 viruses elicited antibodies against the CA/7/09 virus and provided complete protection from challenge with this virus in ferrets; the response in mice was variable and conferred partial protection. Although ferrets infected with sw/IA/31 virus developed low titers of cross-neutralizing antibody, they were protected from pulmonary replication of the CA/7/09 virus. The data suggest that prior exposure to antigenically related H1N1 viruses of swine-origin, by prior infection or receipt of the swine flu vaccine of 1976, provide some protective immunity against the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 virus.There are several potential strategies for the development of vaccines to protect humans against influenza viruses, including formalin inactivated whole or split virus, HA subunit, and live attenuated virus vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have several attributes related to safety, immunogenicity, cross-protection against antigenic drift strains, high yield and needle-free administration that make them attractive candidates for control of pandemic influenza. Live attenuated vaccines generally induce broadly cross-reactive protection, which may be a useful feature in the event of a pandemic if a vaccine generated from the actual pandemic strain is not available. LID scientists collaborated with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to evaluate candidate vaccines against pandemic influenza viruses, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. The vaccine virus generated by MedImmune contains the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus and the attenuating genes from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold adapted (A/AA/6/60 ca) donor virus. The role of seasonal influenza vaccination in pandemic H1N1 disease was important to address because a large segment of the population is vaccinated annually. We administered one or two doses of a live attenuated pandemic H1N1 vaccine (p-LAIV), a seasonal trivalent inactivated (s-TIV) or seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine (s-LAIV) to mice and ferrets and subsequently challenged them with a pandemic H1N1 virus. In both species, the p-LAIV vaccine was immunogenic and conferred complete protection against challenge. s-TIV did not confer protection in either animal model and s-LAIV did not confer any protection in ferrets. In mice, two doses of s-LAIV led to complete protection in the upper respiratory tract and partial protection in the lungs. Our data indicate that vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccines did not confer complete protection in the lower respiratory tract in either animal model while the p-LAIV vaccine conferred complete protection in both animal models. Our observations also indicate that exposure to seasonal influenza vaccines may play a role in reducing susceptibility and morbidity from pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection and suggest the importance of exploring the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon.The factors underlying the epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were undefined. Although the virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from seasonal human H1N1 viruses, the clinical data from the pandemic suggested that prior exposure to influenza played a significant role in susceptibility to disease and immune response to the pandemic virus. Individuals over 50 years of age had antibodies that cross-reacted with and appeared to be less susceptible to infection with the pandemic H1N1 (p-H1N1) virus, presumably due to prior exposure to an antigenically related H1N1 influenza virus. In addition, data from p-H1N1 vaccine trials suggested that a large segment of the population had been exposed to an influenza virus that  primed  individuals such that only one dose of the novel pandemic vaccine was sufficient to elicit a protective antibody titer. This observation was unexpected because studies conducted in the 1970s had shown that 2 doses of vaccine were needed to immunize a nave population. We evaluated the effect of seasonal (s) H1N1 infection, s- trivalent inactivated vaccine (s-TIV) and s- trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (s-LAIV) prior to immunization with a pandemic live attenuated vaccine (p-LAIV) in mice. We compared serum and mucosal antibody, pulmonary CD8 and CD4 responses and the virologic response to challenge with a wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 (p-H1N1) virus. Two doses of p-LAIV induced cellular immune and robust ELISA and neutralizing antibody responses that were associated with complete protection from p-H1N1 challenge. A single dose of p-LAIV induced a cellular response and ELISA but not neutralizing antibody response and incomplete protection from p-H1N1 virus challenge. Primary infection with s-H1N1 influenza virus followed by a dose of p-LAIV resulted in cross-reactive ELISA antibodies and a robust cellular immune response that was also associated with complete protection from p-H1N1 virus challenge. A lower magnitude but similar response associated with partial protection was seen in mice that received a dose of s-LAIV vaccine followed by p-LAIV. Mice that received a dose of s-TIV followed by p-LAIV did not show any evidence of priming. In summary, prior infection with a seasonal influenza virus or s-LAIV primed mice for a robust response to a single dose of p-LAIV that was associated with protection equivalent to two doses of the matched pandemic vaccine.'"

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first recognized as a threat to the developing fetus, there have been repeated calls for a vaccine that could protect from the damaging effects of HCMV infection in those at risk for HCMV disease. The long quest for a HCMV vaccine that could prevent congenital infection and fetal sequelae, as well as end-organ disease in immune compromised individuals, remains unfulfilled. The primary objective measure for evaluating the efficiency of any vaccine is whether protective levels of immunity are generated and sustained in the vaccinees. An important issue for HCMV is the definition of what constitutes protective immunity. Using a stringent threshold, an immune response can be considered protective only if the vaccinees are absolutely protected from infection following repeated exposure to virus. Alternatively, a vaccine could still be considered protective if the course of challenge virus infection was so dramatically altered that the potential for transmission (horizontal and vertical) and pathogenesis of challenge virus was essentially eliminated. The difference between the two involves the level of virus replication at the primary site of challenge and the extent of dissemination beyond. The former definition requires the generation and maintenance of sterilizing immunity with no spread of the virus. The latter does not, but it does require that the immune system maintain a lifelong restriction on replication of a virus with a complex natural history of persistence in immune competent hosts. The hypothesis is presented that immunization against CMV can generate protective immune responses, although the degree of protection (sterilizing versus limited dissemination) will be dependent on both the titer of challenge virus and the frequency of exposure. According to this hypothesis, immunization can protect completely against infrequent exposure to a low titer CMV challenge. Protection will become more variable as the titer and/or the frequency of exposure to challenge virus increases. Vaccination should shift the virus-host balance decidedly in favor of the host such that both reactivation and shedding are significantly diminished. The hypothesis will be tested in the rhesus macaque model of HCMV infection through the following Aims. (I) Genetic immunization of seronegative macaques with plasmid expression vectors for RhCMV gB, pp65, and IE1, followed by immunization with formalin-inactivated virus. (II) Subcutaneous challenge of vaccinees and controls by experimental inoculation with either high or low titers of RhCMV. (III) Immunization of macaques followed by challenge of vaccinees and controls by natural routes with natural titers of RhCMV by co-housing vaccinees with seropositive, virus-excreting macaques. (IV) Alterations of RhCMV gene expression patterns to induce novel protective immune responses. A CMV vaccine can be considered protective if it results in a dead-end infection. This proposal will stringently test whether a combination of genetic immunization and formalin-inactivated virus can effectively eliminate horizontal spread of RhCMV following either experimental or natural infection.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA vaccines have shown great promise in eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses in a variety of rodent and non-human primate models. We are proposing to develop a DNA vaccine against schistosome infection which affects over 200 million people with an additional 600 million at risk in 74 countries. Our previous studies using the vaccine candidate Sm-p80 has shown that its efficacy can be improved by the addition of DNA encoding immunomodulatory cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12) in a DNA vaccine formulation. The experiments proposed in this application are designed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which this important antigen confers immunity in an animal model system; this includes the role of different subsets of T cells and complement. The major objective of this proposal is to develop an effective protective vaccine against schistosomiasis. Second objective will be to examine the potential of a protective prophylactic vaccination strategy as a therapeutic treatment modality in an attempt to resolve a chronic parasitic infection and associated disease sequelae in mice and non-human primates. The development of schistosome-baboon chronic infection model may result in an important international resource for other investigations. The potential exists that the availability of such a well characterized animal model could provide insight and directly impact studies involving schistosome pathogenesis and transmission. It may also provide an invaluable research tool for future vaccine and therapeutic investigations. A schistosomiasis vaccine would make a great impact to existing means of disease control, especially if it provides an effective, long-term immunity against the infection. Parasitic disease, schistosomiasis continues to take an enormous toll on the human health in terms of both mortality and morbidity. This disease is endemic in 74 countries with 790 million people at risk. Schistosomes infect more than 200 million people with the highest prevalence and severity of infection occurring among school-age children. The sum of years of life lost through disability (DALYs) because of this debilitating and chronic disease has been estimated to be 1.7 million/year.     In spite of advances in control via snail eradication and large-scale chemotherapy using praziquantel (a drug developed 30 years ago); this disease continues to spread to new geographic areas. Another alarming trend is the reported increase in resistance to praziquantel, the mainstay of current medical treatment. Presently, there is no vaccine for controlling this disease. Therefore a schistosomiasis vaccine would make a great impact on the existing means of disease control, especially if it provides an effective, long-term immunity against the infection.     Based on published studies from our group for the past 17 years and recent preliminary data, we have identified a novel schistosome protein that was originally identified to be involved in the surface membrane biogenesis. This phenomenon has been considered to be one of the mechanisms utilized by blood-dwelling worms to evade the protective host immune response. This protein designated calpain, has two subunits, the larger of which, designated Sm-p80 has been demonstrated to be antigenic when administered to mice. Furthermore, immunization with various formulations of Sm-p80 has resulted in a significant level of protective immunity in mice following an experimental challenge with schistosome cercariae. We believe that Sm-p80 represents a unique target to invoke protective immunity against schistosome infection and, as such; a novel vaccine candidate. Based on promising results from our laboratory, the UNDP/World Bank/WHO-TDR special panel (Manila, Philippines, October 6-8, 2003), designated, Sm-p80 as one of the priority antigens with established credentials, needing further development and Sm-p80 is now considered as one of the first-tier candidates by international experts in the field.     We are proposing to develop a Sm-p80-based schistosomiasis vaccine using a wide variety of approaches (e.g., naked DNA, prime-boost etc.). We intend to the test the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this vaccine in animal models (mice and nonhuman primates). This vaccine can be administered to small children in order to prevent severe infection in the following years of high risk (3-12 years of age). This age group of children and young adolescents correspond to those ages in which contact with infected water is maximal. Booster doses of schistosomiasis vaccine may not be necessary since subsequent exposure to infective larvae could provide continuous re- stimulation to immunity. Such a vaccine would greatly reduce the need for logistically difficult and expensive drug-based programs and will save millions of lives.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a revised application for a project focused on development of an effective vaccine for prevention of disease caused by Ebola virus (EBOV), a filovirus which is an etiologic agent of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever. Ebola virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat of causing an epidemic outbreak. Our group has been engaged in the development of VLP vaccines against virus infection, and our results have shown that EBOV VLPs produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system, which gives high VLP production yield, exhibit DC-stimulating activity and induce strong antibody responses that neutralize EBOV GP mediated virus infection (Ye et al., 2006), indicating that such VLPs could serve as safe and effective vaccines to induce protective immunity against EBOV infection. Furthermore, we also made the finding in recent studies that immunization with a mixture of DNA and VLP vaccines (DNA/VLP) induced higher levels of both antibody and cellular immune responses in comparison to immunization with DNA or VLP vaccines alone. The combined benefit of two non-viral-vector based vaccine platforms obtained with this novel vaccine strategy demonstrates its potential for the development of an efficacious vaccine against EBOV infection. In this project, we will test the hypotheses that the novel DNA/VLP vaccine strategy will elicit strong cellular and antibody responses against EBOV infection and that the use of an adjuvant will further augment induction of such responses, with the aim to obtain a vaccine strategy that can confer rapid as well as long lasting protection against EBOV infection. Specific Aim 1. We will compare immune responses induced by DNA/VLP immunization with DNA or VLP vaccines alone and determine whether the DNA/VLP vaccine strategy is superior to confer rapid (with reduced number of vaccinations) as well as long lasting (at six months after vaccinations) protection against EBOV infection. Moreover, we will employ a transgenic mouse model to investigate the underlying mechanism for the induction of enhanced antibody and T cell responses by DNA/VLP immunization, which will provide instructive information for further development of more potent vaccines against EBOV as well as other pathogens. Specific Aim 2. We will investigate the effect of adjuvant on DNA/VLP vaccination in comparison with DNA or VLP vaccination alone, and determine whether a potent vaccine strategy can be obtained to elicit protective immunity against EBOV infection by a single immunization. Moreover, we will further investigate the efficacy of DNA/VLP vaccines in guinea pigs to assess their potency against EBOV infection in a different small laboratory animal model, with the aim to determine the potential of the DNA/VLP vaccine strategy for future evaluation in the non-human primate model. Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filovirus which is an etiologic agent of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever. Ebola virus can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat of an epidemic outbreak. We have previously shown the combined benefit of two non-viral-vector based vaccine platforms and its potential for the development of an efficacious vaccine against EBOV infection. In this project we will test the hypotheses that the novel DNA/VLP vaccine strategy will elicit strong cellular and antibody responses against EBOV infection and that the use of an adjuvant will further augment induction of such responses.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by selective destruction of insulin secreting beta-cells found in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Viral infection is one event proposed to initiate beta-cell damage during the development of this disease. While recent studies have begun to unravel the mechanisms by which virus infection modulates the lymphocytic response, few studies have examined the impact of virus infection on macrophage activation or the direct effects of virus infection on beta-cell function and viability. The broad goals of this research are to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which virus infection regulates macrophage activation and to determine the virus-activated pathways that contribute to the loss of beta-cell function and viability. Using a virus known to induce diabetes in susceptible mice, we have recently identified three novel antiviral signaling pathways that regulate inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. In response to a virus infection, the fate of beta-cells appears to be dependent on the response elicited, where an inflammatory response appears to result in beta-cell necrosis, and in the absence of inflammation beta-cell apoptosis ensues. There are two specific aims: 1. To test the hypothesis that the activation state of PI3K determines the response of macrophages to virus infection. When PI3K is in an activated state, virus infection stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes such as IL-1, iNOS and COX-2. When inhibited, virus infection induces macrophage apoptosis.  2. To elucidate the pathways responsible for regulating the response of  beta-cells to a virus infection. Specific experiments will determine the mechanisms by which virus infection stimulates inflammatory gene expression by beta-cells, and the pathways and determinants that are responsible for beta-cell death, either by necrosis or apoptosis. A number of biochemical, molecular, immunological, histochemical, and transgenic techniques will be utilized to investigate the cellular pathways through which viral infection stimulates macrophage activation and modulates  beta-cell function and viability. It is hoped that insights into regulation of macrophage and beta-cell responses to virus infection gained from these proposed studies will influence the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention of this debilitating disease.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly, and bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by RSV are the primary reason for hospitalization of young children. For many years there has been an active search to find a safe and effective vaccine to prevent primary RSV infection in naWve infants, although progress in RSV vaccine development has been hampered by the unusual biology of the virus as well as the legacy of vaccine-enhanced illness during trials of a formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine preparation in the mid 1960's. The problem of establishing RSV immunity is complicated by the fact that while the presence of neutralizing antibody is generally protective against pulmonary infection, re-infection of the upper airway throughout life is the rule. The observation that adaptive immune response fails to protect the upper airway is well established, but not well understood. While upper airway disease is never life threatening, it is nonetheless a very important health problem as RSV has been shown to be the predominant viral pathogen predisposing children to bacterial otitis media (OM). Since RSV is a major trigger for OM, and clinical data show frequent reinfection in young children, we hypothesize that development of an effective vaccine targeting RSV infection will have a significant impact on the occurrence of OM. In the first cycle of this grant we have developed both murine and chinchilla models of RSV upper airway infection, and have used these to test a new RSV vaccine candidate: a recombinant Newcastle disease virus vector expressing the RSV F protein. We have found that mucosal priming with this construct is protective in both rodent models, and now wish to explore both the mechanism of this protection as well as the ability of this vaccine to inhibit bacterial OM following viral and bacterial co- infection. Our specific aims are these: 1) Determine whether immunization against RSV can protect against bacterial co-infection in the chinchilla model; 2) Define the correlates of upper airway protection; and 3) Determine the mechanisms by which RSV infection enhances host susceptibility of bacterial OM.     Recent studies have found that otitis media, or ear infections, in babies and young children are always caused by infection with both a viral and a bacterial organism. The bacteria that cause ear infections normally live in the nose, and are not a problem until the child catches a cold. Once the child has a virus infection, the host defenses are damaged, and normally harmless bacteria then cause disease. There is one cold virus called RSV which infects children over and over and is found in the majority of children with ear infections. Our group has found a new vaccine against this virus, and want to test whether immunity to RSV can protect against the process that causes bacterial ear infections.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the United States, 5-20% of the population display symptoms of infection with the influenza virus. More than 110,000 of these persons are hospitalized and about 36,000 die from complications. While the spread of infection is generally avoidable through immunization, vaccine may be in short supply, logistics may limit distribution, compliance and lack of concern limit the immunized population and the vaccines are not as efficacious in the very old and very young. This year, a highly virulent avian influenza strain, designated H5N1, has spread rapidly throughout Asia and into Europe. Reports of human infections with H5N1 have increased the concern that this strain, or a recombinant with a virus that commonly infects humans, may expand its host range to infect humans and result in a global pandemic. A moderate pandemic could kill more than 30 million people around the world. A vaccine could be available within six months of recognition of a pandemic. However, influenza vaccine production is limited - only 300 million doses can be manufactured worldwide due to the difficulty in cultivating virus and capacity will take years to expand. Further, in the event of any widespread disease, rapid distribution to the population, insufficient healthcare personnel to administer the vaccine, lack of compliance due to needlestick phobia, and other issues may result in a poorly immunized population. The research proposed by Rocky Mountain Biosystems, Inc. in this application will demonstrate an innovative solution to achieve an immunized, protected population, addressing issues of limited supply, lack of access and compliance. The Self Administered Vaccination Electromechanical (SAVE) device gently and quickly reduces the stratum corneum, administers efficacious and consistent amounts of vaccine in minutes, and avoids creation of  sharps  that constitute biohazardous waste. The device is designed to increase the efficacy of drugs and vaccines, while reducing dosage and extending vaccine supplies. The device is small, inexpensive, self-administrable and can be stockpiled for rapid deployment in the case of a pandemic. The device is expected to 1) extend the vaccine supply as much as 20-fold by adaptation to the more efficient transcutaneous route of vaccine administration, 2) greatly improve compliance through self-administration without needles, and 3) be capable of rapid deployment to the populace. Furthermore, SAVE's transcutaneous delivery is expected to enhance cellular immunity versus intramuscular (IM) inoculation, potentially improving immunity in the very young and old. The SAVE technology may also extend the benefits of transdermal drug delivery to new drugs, such as the growing number of macromolecule drugs and fragile protein or peptide bond biopharmaceuticals. In this proposal, the investigators propose to build pre-clinical prototypes of the patch and test it in vitro and in vivo in a swine model, as well as testing impedance in humans.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This clinical trial will test the efficacy of cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine (Aventis Pasteur) with MF59 adjuvant (Chiron Vaccines) to prevent maternal CMV infection, using a phase II, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Healthy young women are screened for antibody to CMV on the post-partum wards of 4 hospitals. Those who are seronegative are invited to participate in the clinical trial. Participants are enrolled and immunized (3 doses of vaccine, 0, 1 and 6 month schedule). Participants have follow-up visits every three months for three years after the third dose of vaccine in order to screen them for CMV infection, collect samples for immunogenicity studies, identify pregnancies and births, and collect safety information. All infants born to clinical trial participants are tested for congenital CMV infection by virus culture at birth. As of August 31, 2003, over 12,000 women had been screened for antibody to CMV, and 252 subjects enrolled. Twenty-eight CMV infections have occurred so far, a rate of 6.6% per year. There were 78 pregnancies among 66 trial participants, and 2 congenital CMV infections among 54 live births (3.7%). Important accomplishments in this trial to date include: enrolled around two-thirds of planned sample, developed a novel, accurate and inexpensive means of endpoint (CMV infection) detection for CMV vaccine clinical trials, recruited a study population with a CMV infection rate that allows us to accumulate the largest group of healthy asymptomatic young women with primary CMV infection ever studied, established use of immunologic and virologic assays that will allow us to learn a great deal from this trial whether or not vaccine is effective in preventing maternal infections.    Specific aims will test the ability of CMV gB/MF59 vaccine to prevent maternal infection, evaluate the rate of congenital CMV infection in offspring of trial participants, determine whether maternal CMV infection is associated with miscarriage, characterize the virologic and immunologic features of primary CMV infections, evaluate novel approaches to end-point identification in CMV vaccine clinical trials, define long-term immunogenicity of study vaccine (antibody to CMV gB, neutralizing antibody and cell mediated immune response) and compare rates of adverse events as well as local and systemic reactions in CMV gB/MF59 recipients to placebo recipients. Based on enrollment to date and the rate of CMV infection in trial participants, we expect to have 60 to 90 CMV infections in the study population and approximately 200 pregnancies. With planned enrollment and these event rates, the clinical trial will achieve the power needed to test efficacy for prevention of maternal infection and will provide a preliminary estimate of whether immunization affects rates of congenital CMV infection.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the project is to develop statistical methods for the design and analysis of preventive HIV vaccine efficacy trials and repeated low-dose non-human primate (NHP) challenge trials. Specifically the methods are for (1) Sieve Analysis: Assessing the impact of HIV genotypic and phenotypic variation on HIV vaccine efficacy; (2) Post-infection Vaccine Efficacy: Assessing HIV vaccine effects on post-HIV infection disease progression; and (3) Correlates/Surrogates of Protective Immunity: Assessing correlations of immunological measurements with risk of HIV/SIV infection rate and of post-infection outcomes, and evaluating whether and to what extent the correlations are causative. Aim 1 will develop a model for studying the relationship between vaccine efficacy and multivariate summary measures of distance of an exposing virus to the immunogen, accounting for subject characteristics including their immune responses to vaccination, and will develop high-dimensional data methods for relating HIV amino acid sequences in breakthrough infections with viral load and other post-infection endpoints. Aim 2 will develop methods for studying durability of vaccine effects on viral load over time, tackling the problems of selection bias that may arise because the analyzed groups are selected after randomization, and  missing  viral loads that may arise because infected subjects initiate antiretro viral therapy. Aim 3 will develop methods for assessing correlates/surrogates of protection in efficacy trials and in NHP trials. The aims are complementary and integrated, with HIV sequence, immunological, and viral load data used for each aim. The methods will be applied to analyze several HIV vaccine efficacy trial and NHP challenge trial datasets. Primary goals of HIV vaccine research include developing a vaccine that protects broadly against many HIV strains and that can durably suppress viremia, and developing a correlate of protective immunity, which would streamline vaccine development and provide the basis for bridging efficacy of a vaccine observed in a Phase 3 trial to a new setting. By improving the design and analysis of efficacy and NHP trials for addressing these areas, the project will benefit public health.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Therefore, the development of vaccines to prevent HCV infection, or at least to prevent progression of chronicity, is a major goal. Virus entry is an attractive target for inhibition of virus infection because the entry machinery is extracellular and it is therefore accessible to antibody. Neutralizing antibodies are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens which bind to specific epitopes on the envelope proteins of virus, and render them incapable of infecting target cells by a variety of mechanisms. Recombinant E1 and E2 glycoproteins of HCV genotype 1a are currently in use as a candidate vaccine in an ongoing Phase I clinical trial in human volunteers (sponsored by DMID, NIH, at the Saint Louis University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit), and appear to induce neutralizing antibody. We and others have grown HCV in cell culture and developed pseudotype viruses as models for studies of HCV infection, and examined antibody-mediated virus neutralization. We hypothesize that HCV E1E2 vaccine induced antibodies can have strong neutralizing activity in the presence of serum complement, genotype cross-protective effects, or possibly enhance HCV infectivity. We plan an in-depth investigation into the qualitative nature of humoral immune responses induced during a Phase I clinical trial of the HCV candidate vaccine by addressing the following specific aims: (1) Determine the extent and qualitative nature by which complement enhances viral neutralization mediated by vaccine induced antibodies. (2) Study possible cross-neutralization of other HCV genotypes by vaccine induced antibodies. (3)  Investigate the role of immune complex formation in modulation of HCV infectivity. Our proposed complimentary experimental approaches in this vaccinated cohort will help in developing successful vaccine strategies for the intervention of the first crucial step of the HCV life cycle.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The annual morbidity and mortality associated with influenza virus, and its capacity to undergo genetic variation leading to highly virulent strains capable of causing worldwide pandemics, makes this virus both an ongoing and emerging threat to public health. There is therefore a high priority need for the development of an animal model that closely mimics human disease, and which can be used to gain a better understanding of influenza virus pathogenesis and the viral factors associated with highly virulent and pandemic strains. In this application, we propose to develop a pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model of influenza virus infection. These animals will be infected with wild-type A/Texas/96/31 virus (a mildly pathogenic strain often used in vaccine production) or with engineered strains of A/Texas/96/31 that contain one or more genes from the highly virulent 1918 pandemic strain (commonly referred to as the Spanish Flu). We will closely monitor clinical, pathological, and cytopathic changes in these animals and will correlate these findings with global gene expression data obtained using macaque oligonucleotide microarrays. These studies will be performed by Dr. Carole Baskin (DVM), who has recently completed a 4-year fellowship in the Department of Comparative Medicine, and who is seeking the training necessary to develop an independent research program focused on using nonhuman primates as models of human infectious disease. She will be mentored in these studies by Dr. Michael G. Katze, Professor of Microbiology and Associate Director at the Washington National Primate Research Center. The training environment provides outstanding facilities, expertise in nonhuman primate models of virus infection, and state-of-the-art resources for using genomic technologies and bioinformatics to study virus-host interactions. There are also ample opportunities for scientific interactions with influenza experts across the country, including a number of renowned scientists working on the 1918 virus. These studies will provide training in the skills needed to use nonhuman primates as models for human infectious disease, to develop and implement a scientifically sound research program, and to incorporate genomic technologies for the evaluation of gene expression as well as clinical data. The findings generated by these studies will provide new insights into how influenza virus causes human disease and why certain strains of the virus have a markedly increased capacity to do so. Such knowledge may lead to new therapeutic or vaccine strategies, which may serve as vital countermeasures against future influenza outbreaks.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop a rapid, low cost, threshold assay for the detection of HIV infection of HIV vaccination trial participants. Infection by HIV, and viral load are the usual end points for Phase III HIV vaccination trials. Ongoing Phase III HIV vaccine trials require a simple, and low cost molecular diagnostic test that can detect HIV infection in immunized participants. Indeed, current molecular tests are too complex to be used for screening purposes, immunoassays cannot distinguish between immunization and infection, and CD4 cell counts are unlikely to detect early HIV infection. Although FDA requires the use an approved assay to measure viral load in order to meet the demands for licensure, a low cost, moderate complexity, screening test will greatly facilitate these trials. Indeed all participants in both the placebo and vaccine arms must be screened periodically (e.g., at 3 to 6 month intervals). The assay we propose to develop will use our proprietary helicase dependent amplification (HDA) platform as well as a low cost device specifically designed to perform molecular tests without contaminating the laboratory with amplification products. HDA is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in that it uses two primers to exponentially amplify nucleic acids. It is distinct from PCR in that it is entirely isothermal (and thus does not require costly thermocyclers). We propose to use simulated clinical samples generated with the Armored RNA HIV Quant clone spiked into whole blood from HIV seronegative volunteers at known concentrations. Armored RNA will be isolated from plasma prior to RT-HDA testing. Lateral flow devices have already proven their utility in separating nucleic acid amplification products, and are widely used in several  moderate complexity  and CLIA-waived tests listed in the FDA device database. Detection of amplicons will be accomplished by using latex particles conjugated to antibodies that bind to the probes used to detect the HDA reaction products. The assay uses a sandwich format to detect haptens (biotin, FITC and Digoxigenin) incorporated into one of the HDA primers and into each of the detection probes. The lateral flow strip used for these assays has two capture zones, and thus allows for the detection of one analyte (HIV) as well as a competitive internal control. Assays that fail to give a band in the lateral flow device window are scored as invalid, while assays with a band in the control line alone are scored as true negative. Assays with bands at both the control and test line position are scored as positives at the threshold value (typically 50 copies of the analyte). Assays with a strong band in the test line but no control line are scored as strong positives (typically over 5000 copies of analyte). We will test the specificity and sensitivity of the HIV test with clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University. Kits will be supplied to Dr. Yi-Wei Tang (Vanderbilt University) so his laboratory can evaluate the assays. We may also supply kits to US Government labs that want to try the test. We will also contract with Assuragen to engineer a clone of Armored RNA for our competitive internal control. Finally, we will compare the performance of HDA and the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 DNA PCR (version 1.5) using a set of Dried Blood Spot (DBS) specimens from the CDC's Proficiency Testing (PT) Program. By the end of Phase I, we will have preliminary data for submission of a pre-IDE to the FDA to kick-off a clinical study to seek regulatory clearance for sale of the assay system for human diagnostics using the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 DNA PCR (version 1.5) assay as a predicate device.Narrative More than 90 % of the 40 million human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons live in Third World countries (see www.unaids.org/bangkok2004/GAR2004_html/GAR2004_03_en.htm). An HIV vaccine is the lowest cost medical solution for containing the acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in developing countries. Ongoing Phase III HIV vaccine trials use protection from infection (or reduced viral load when infection still occurs) as an end point. However, in order to meet the demands for licensure the FDA requires us to use an approved assay to measure viral load. These trials require a simple, and low cost molecular diagnostic test that can detect HIV infection in immunized participants. Current evidence suggests that only the central memory pool of CD4 T cells is affected very early in infection. Since this represents less than 1% of the circulating CD4 T cells, existing low cost CD4 monitoring tests used in the third world cannot replace viral RNA as a surrogate for detecting infection. Moreover, rapid immunodiagnostic assays cannot distinguish between immunization and infection, and current molecular diagnostic assays are too complex, and expensive for most developing country laboratories. Although transporting samples, using dry blood spots (DBS), to laboratories that can perform complex molecular tests offers a solution to this problem, a simple, and low cost molecular diagnostic test is preferable from the standpoint of the patient, and medical ethics (i.e., the sooner an infection is detected the sooner the patient could receive treatment with antiviral drugs). Once a participant has been identified as infected, a blood sample can be collected and analyzed with a high complexity, FDA approved viral load assay. BioHelix's proprietary helicase dependent amplification (HDA) platform is similar to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in that it uses two primers to exponentially amplify nucleic acids. HDA is distinct from PCR in that it is entirely isothermal (and thus does not require costly thermocyclers). Indeed, HDA can be performed in a simple $100 water bath. To illustrate the potential of this technology for the third world, we currently sell HDA reagents as part of a teaching kit for use in high schools (sold through Carolina Biological Supply). BioHelix is combining this HDA technology with a low cost (~$2-$3.75) disposable device specifically designed to perform molecular tests without contaminating the laboratory with amplicons. The device uses a lateral flow system to detect amplification products. Lateral flow devices are common in many moderately complex, and CLIA-waived tests listed on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) device database. We believe this combination of characteristics makes our proposed product ideal for the HIV vaccine trial sites. In addition, recent evidence suggests that more than half of the newly acquired infections are caused by acutely infected individuals who are often seronegative. A low cost nucleic acid screening test will help identify those people and reduce the spread of the HIV epidemic as well as benefit participants in HIV vaccination trials who become infected with the virus.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this proposal is to obtain safe and effective vaccines for the prevention of the most common respiratory viruses of childhood, namely respiratory syncytial virus and human parainfluenza viruses, type 1 and 3. In spite of their epidemiologic importance, no vaccines exist for these pathogens. In this program it is proposed that the murine type 1 parainfluenza virus, Sendai virus, is an effective vaccine for its human cognate (human parainfluenza virus type 1; hPIV1). Based on our previous demonstration of SV-induced protection against hPIV1 in non-human primates and preliminary success in manipulating the cDNA of SV obtained through reverse genetics, we propose that SV can serve as an effective vaccine for hPIV1 and as a vaccine backbone for additional paramyxoviral antigens. The Paramyxovirus Vaccine Program at SJCRH integrates pre-clinical and clinical research and involves members of the Departments of Infectious Diseases, the Division of Virology and the Department of Immunology. This integrated, multidisciplinary approach is essential to ultimately determine the immunologic and virologic features that reliably predict paramyxovirus vaccine efficacy. The Program consists of 3 Projects: Project 1 - Recombinant Sendai virus as a novel paramyxovirus vaccine (PORTNER); Project 2 - Immune response and vaccine efficacy in a rodent model (HURWITZ); and Project 3 - Clinical and primate paramyxovirus vaccine evaluation (SLOBOD). The strengths of the Program are based in the strength of Sendai virus as a vaccine backbone and in the experience, skills and diversity of the assembled investigators working together towards a unified objective. Ultimately, this program will yield (1) a candidate respiratory virus vaccine; (2) reagents including a panel of 12 recombinant Sendai virus vaccines (differing according to target gene identity and mode of expression), monoclonal antibodies, purified recombinant proteins of hPIV-3 and RSV; and (3) information which can be applied to the study of paramyxovirus vaccine development, including T and B cell studies of durable immunity to these most common respiratory viruses. Taken together, this comprehensive program has a high likelihood of success, measured as the identification of protective and safe respiratory virus vaccines.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An adequate medical response to the threat of pandemic influenza includes surveillance and isolation, a sufficient supply of antiviral drugs, and rapid development of a protective vaccine. Under optimal circumstances, production of enough vaccine to protect the US population would take 6 months. A lag time of 6 months between identification of a pandemic strain and an adequate supply of vaccine could result in devastating morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A dose-sparing adjuvant that enabled a limited supply of vaccine to protect more people would diminish this problem. We have identified small lipophilic molecules that penetrate the intact stratum corneum and activate the dendritic cells (DCs) in normal mouse skin. They enable resident DCs to process antigens injected into the skin without endogenous adjuvants, and cause the DCs to mature and migrate to the draining lymph node where they activate na¿ve T cells. The speed with which these topical adjuvants promote protective T cell immunity, their low cost, and physical independence of the vaccine antigen, suggest that they might be ideal adjuvants for enhancing the protection afforded by a limiting supply of influenza vaccine. We will test whether our topical adjuvants 1) accelerate the development of T-dependent antibody responses to influenza vaccine injected into mouse skin; 2) elicit the same concentration of influenza-specific antibodies using lower doses of vaccine in mice; 3) enable lower doses of vaccine to protect mice against a lethal challenge with influenza virus; and 4) exhibit a transdermal transport rate across human skin ex vivo sufficient to permit activation of human skin DCs in vivo. If our efforts are successful, the product will be an inexpensive small molecule, applied to the skin over a vaccine injection site that will make vaccines more effective. As stand-alone adjuvants, if our topical DC activators are found to be safe and effective in humans, they should enhance the efficacy of any vaccine that can be delivered into the skin. The best public health response to pandemic influenza is an effective vaccine, but with current vaccine manufacturing capabilities it could take years to produce enough vaccine to protect the US population. We need vaccine additives that can extend the effective dose of a vaccine to cover more people. That is the goal of the proposed research.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a corrected and revised resubmission to study virus-induced immune response modulating molecule(s) that suppress the virus-specific T cell response that is required to clear virus, and the use of neutralizing antibodies to such virus-induced host suppressor molecules to resurrect the exhausted T cells which then can control the virus infection. Realizing that viruses persist and in doing so cause disease is one of the major accomplishments in virology. The principles of how this occurs and how to prevent and treat persistent infections continues as the topic for this productive research grant for which funding of the 40th to 45th year is requested. Our tact is to use lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of its natural host, the mouse, to uncover principles involved. The success of this approach (by ourselves and others) provided the initial findings for virus-antiviral antibody immune complexes, CD8 CTL-mediated killing, CD4 help for maintaining CD8 activity, fine mapping of T cell epitopes, MHC restriction; determination that peptides of 9 aa or less fit into the MHC class I groove, expansion, contraction and memory of antigen-specific CD8, CD4 and B lymphocyte responses, use of adoptive transfer of memory T cells to abort persistent infection, analysis of the immunologic synapse in vivo and the ability of non-lytic persistent viruses to cause disease by altering differentiated function of the infected cell without affecting its vital function. Recently, we and others have uncovered host immune response modulating molecules induced by virus that suppressed the T cell response(s) required to purge virus. Remarkably, the use of antibody therapy to neutralize such host molecules resurrected function to non-functional (exhausted) T cells so these T cells were now able to control the viral infection. Immunosurveillance and removing virally infected cells is primarily the function of T cells. We made the stunning observation that IL-10 determines viral clearance or persistence in vivo and that antibody blockade of IL-10 receptor (R) during persistent infection when T cells are non-functional restores their function, brings back deleted subset of CD8 killer T cells, purges virus and controls the viral infection. We propose to define the mechanism(s) involved, determine the host cells producing IL-10, optimize therapy and study combined effect with addition of antibodies to IL-10R and PD-1 and, lastly, analyze the use of virus-induced blockade of host immunosuppressive molecules as strategies for vaccine therapy of persistent viral infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major public health concern is persistent virus infection and a major biomedical challenge is the understanding and design of successful therapy to counteract these infections. Such infections are characterized, in part, by T cell exhaustion, a state where virus-specific T cells no longer function to control the virus. We identify a host gene product, IL-10, induced by virus to suppress the host's immune response, develop and design therapy to neutralize IL-10 with antibodies during the state of T cell exhaustion thereby resurrecting antiviral T cell function which is able to limit or cure the persistent infection.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Program Project proposes in-depth studies of the development of CD8+ T lymphocyte responses to persistent (EBV) and non-persistent (vaccinia, yellow fever) virus infections with particular emphasis on understanding induction and long-term maintenance of antigen-specific and cross-reactive CD8+ T cells. The overall goals are: 1) To use models of persistent (EBV) and non-persistent (VV or YFV) viral infections to characterize the lineage relationship between effector and memory responses in humans and the factors that influence evolution of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses into the memory CD8+ T cell repertoire; 2) To characterize how cross-reactivity influences the evolution of the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell repertoire and understand the structural and functional properties of the T cell receptor that contribute to recognition of antigen-specific or cross-reactive ligands; 3) To correlate antigen-specific and cross-reactive CD8+ T cell frequencies and functional properties with control of viral replication or manifestations of disease. Project #1 will use the Epstein Barr model of persistent viral infection to characterize the lineage relationship between effector and memory responses and the factors that influence evolution of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses into the memory CD8+ T cell repertoire. Project #2 will test the hypothesis that the quantity, quality, and avidity of an epitope-specific response to acute viral infection are dramatically altered by acute heterologous virus infections and may alter disease outcome. It will also test the hypothesis that, because of prior antigenic exposure, adults may have higher frequencies of cross-reactive CD8+ T cells than children. TCR alpha and beta chain spectratyping and sequencing will allow improved understanding of the structural bases for the recognition of antigen-specific or cross-reactive ligands. Project #3 will study vaccinia virus or yellow fever virus vaccine recipients to characterize the lineage relationship between effector and memory responses in humans and the factors that influence evolution of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses into the memory CD8+ T cell repertoire. This project will also test the hypothesis that VV or YFV infection will reactivate cross-reactive CD8+ T cells. The proposed work will benefit from a highly interactive and collaborative group of productive investigators. Four core facilities will facilitate the work of Project Investigators. The Administrative and Clinical Core (Core A) will coordinate the Projects; manage fiscal affairs; be responsible for the collection and processing of clinical specimens from research subjects with AIM or in the latent phase of EBV infection; provide EBV serology and molecular HLA Class I and II typing of research subjects. The Tetramer Core (Core B) will provide HLA Class l/peptide tetramers to all Project Investigators. The Flow Cytometry (Core C) will provide FACS-based cell sorting and characterization of virus-specific or cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses. A TCR Core (Core D) will perform spectratyping, TCR subcloning and sequencing, maintain a TCR repertoire database, and facilitate TCR data analyses. The proposed studies will help us to understand the timing of and factors that control the evolution of human antiviral CD8+ T cell responses from the acute effector phase into long-term memory. These studies will also help us to understand variability in human responses to viral infections and how antigen-specific or cross-reactive CD8+ T cells contribute to either viral control or disease. Understanding the mechanisms operative in the evolution of virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses should contribute to the development of new or improved viral vaccines and the development of novel therapies for autoimmune diseases or virus associated malignancies.      PROJECT 1:  Evolution and Maintenance of EBV-Specific Memory CD8+ T Cells  (Luzuriaga, K.)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Work outlined in this proposal addresses the hypotheses that virus-specific CD8+ T cell repertoires change quantitatively and qualitatively over time following acute infection, and that differences in virus-specific CD8+ T cell repertoires may influence the control of viral replication or disease pathogenesis. Changes in the EBV-specific CD8+ T cell repertoire over time may be based on properties of EBV-specific CD8+ T cell clones (specificity, T cell receptor usage, cytokine receptors, and expression of survival factors) and ongoing antigen exposure. Collaborative work with Drs. Selin and Welsh (Project 3) will test the hypothesis that age-related differences in the evolution of cross-reactive CD8+ T lymphocyte responses will be observed and may be influenced by prior (or lack of prior) exposure to other viral pathogens. To address these hypotheses, we will investigate the evolution of CD8+ T lymphocyte responses during the early (induction) and long-term (maintenance) phases of the immune response in infants, children, adolescents, and adults. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1) To define the relationship between the virus-specific T cell receptor repertoires at serial time points from the acute through the memory phases of the T cell response; 2) To define the relationship between the expression of cytokine receptors or survival factors during the acute phase of the T cell response and T cell clonal persistence into the memory pool; 3) To define the relationship between the functional profiles of virus-specific T cells during the acute phase of the T cell response and their maintenance of proliferative and cytolytic capacity during the long-term memory phase; and 4) To correlate EBV-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies and functional properties over time with blood viral load, pharyngeal shedding, and disease severity. This project directly supports the overall objective of the Program Project by characterizing the induction, evolution, and maintenance of virus-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte responses to a persistent viral infection. Our investigation of memory CD8+ T lymphocyte responses resulting from a persistent viral infection with repeated but changing exposure to viral antigens will complement Drs. Rothman's and Ennis' investigation of memory CD8+ T lymphocyte responses resulting from receipt of yellow fever or vaccinia vaccines in Project 3. Altogether, these studies will help us to understand the timing of and factors that control the evolution of human antiviral CD8+ T cell responses from the acute effector phase into long-term memory. These studies will also help us to understand how antigen-specific or cross-reactive CD8+ T cells may contribute to either viral control or disease. Ultimately, we hope that they will help to inform the development of antiviral vaccines that afford long-term protection against infection or disease, while minimizing the potential adverse effects of these vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus represents a serious public health threat not only with regard to epidemic influenza but also due to the ever-increasing threat of highly virulent pandemic outbreaks. The clearance of primary influenza virus infections is largely thought to be mediated through influenza-specific CD8 T cells, which promote recovery from infection by the killing of influenza-infected cells. Historically, the immune mechanisms responsible for eliminating influenza infections were dependent on perforin and FasL-mediated responses, but recent studies have suggested that CD8 T cells can also trigger apoptosis in virus-infected cells via a TRAIL-dependent mechanism. Notably, our understanding of the involvement of TRAIL in immune responses to influenza-virus is quite limited. Therefore our long-term goal is to delineate the role of TRAIL in influenza-specific immunity with an eye toward the design of protective vaccines and elicitation of effective immune responses against this important human pathogen. Our initial studies have demonstrated that the absence of TRAIL expression during influenza infections increases pulmonary virus titers, morbidity and disease severity and decreases virus- specific cytotoxicity. Further TRAIL and DR5 (i.e. TRAIL receptor 2) expression are significantly upregulated in the lungs of wild type mice following influenza virus infections. This expression appears to correlate with virus elimination and the influx of TRAIL+IFN?+ influenza-specific CD8 T cells into the lungs, suggesting that TRAIL/DR5 (i.e. CD8 T cell/infected cell) interactions could be an integral part in the development of protective immunity to influenza virus. Therefore in this proposal we will utilize both our murine model of influenza virus infection and in vitro infection of human lung cells to determine what role TRAIL expression has in immunity to influenza infections. Specifically, we will address and resolve this question using the following Aims: 1) Determine if TRAIL deficiency alters pulmonary virus clearance, influenza antigen load, and influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses and 2) Determine the mechanism by which influenza infection sensitizes lung cells to TRAIL. This proposal will not only increase our understanding of the immune response to influenza virus infections but also elucidate how TRAIL expression/deficiency may alter the virulence of influenza virus infections. This knowledge will be relevant not only to our understanding of the mechanisms allowing elimination of virus infections in the lungs but also in the design of methods to combat epidemic or pandemic influenza outbreaks. Project Narrative: During epidemic and pandemic influenza, CD8 T cell responses are known to kill influenza-infected cells allowing clearance of the virus and recovery. Recently it has been reported that CD8 T cells can utilize TRAIL, in addition to perforin and FasL, to mediate the killing of virus infected cells. This project will increase our understanding of the role of TRAIL in influenza-specific immune elimination of virus infections of the lungs and therefore aid us in the design of strategies to combat epidemic or pandemic influenza outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute HIV infection is accompanied by a wave of lymphocyte activation and depletion that likely includes both infected and uninfected cells. The mechanisms for lymphocyte activation and the mechanisms for cell loss are not well explained, but are at the core of viral pathogenesis. The ability of HIV infection to drive the depletion of lymphocytes that are mounting anti-viral immune responses may be important in the failure to contain the initial viremia, and may ead to the establishment of persistent infection with chronic disease. We believe that FasL, whose expression increases during viral infection, is a principal mediator of lymphocyte depletion, especially within the Fas receptor expressing memory cell population, and may also influence the acute infection by promoting the expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines that increase the level of virus replication. In this proposal, we postulate that these same mechanisms we have implicated in the pathogenesis of acute SIV infection, may also work to blunt pre-existing immunity that was achieved through vaccination. Should FasL have a major role in overcoming the protective effect of vaccination, it will be an important mechanism for evading host immunity and should be considered alongside sequence variation and other mechanisms that may account for potential vaccine failures. Our experimental approach is to block the activity of FasL during acute SIV infection of macaques, by injecting a monoclonal antibody against this protein. In Preliminary Studies, we provide evidence for the activity of anti-FasL in macaques, showing that treatment of monkeys only during the interval of acute infection, increased cellular and humoral immune responses to virus and extended the survival times after SIV challenge. In the proposed research, we start by immunizing macaques against SIV and reference antigens, then challenging them with SIV infection with or without anti-FasL treatment. The experimental plan also includes studies on gamma/delta T cells and B cells, population that respond to SIV infection but are not susceptible to virus infection. These studies provide a way to define the impact of infection and FasL on cells that are not directly infected by SIV. A comprehensive plan for assays of immune responses, cytokine production and virus burden in blood and lymphoid tissues allows for testing of the main hypothesis about FasL-mediated cell death and will also show the impact of blocking FasL on virus dissemination and cytokine production that might signal alternate mechanisms of action. In future, it may be possible to design vaccine antigens that elicit protective immune responses without driving the production of FasL. These antigens may in and of themselves, elicit stronger responses and provide the host with an important kinetic advantage after natural exposure to HIV. LAY SUMMARY: HIV infection might evade the protective activity of vaccines, by triggering a mechanism for immune cell destruction and loss of protection against HIV disease. Other mechanisms for vaccine evasion include mutation, that changes the chemical structure of viral proteins, and interference with immune cell recognition. By defining the role for immune cell destruction in vaccine evasion, we contribute to a complete understanding of potential mechanisms for vaccine failure that will be used to improve the design and testing of candidate HIV vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural stem cells play a critical role in normal nervous system development and dysregulated neural stem cell death contributes to brain and spinal cord malformations, brain tumor formation, and possibly, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Cell death pathways are remarkably cell- and stimulus- specific and are dependent on interactions between an array of molecules including p53, Bcl-2 family members, caspases, and a variety of autophagy-associated proteins. In a series of studies supported by this grant, we have defined several stimulus-specific neural stem cell death pathways involving p53 and/or Puma, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. In this revised competitive renewal application, we propose a series of novel studies focused on p53 and Puma regulation of physiological and pathological neural stem cell death. In addition to the well known role of apoptotic cell death (Type I Programmed Cell Death), autophagic cell death (Type II Programmed Cell Death) has been increasingly recognized to occur under neuropathological conditions. Studies supported by our grant have demonstrated a role for p53 and Bcl-2 family members in regulating both apoptotic and autophagic cell death in neural stem cells. Our recent data indicate that neural stem cell death is triggered in vivo by a variety of pathological stimuli including genotoxic stress, hypoxic- ischemic injury, and glucocorticoid exposure. These stimuli have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human neonatal and pediatric neurological disorders. In this application, we focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptotic and autophagic neural stem cell death, with a particular emphasis on the in vivo relevance of these overlapping death pathways in two important neonatal mouse models of human neuropathology. To accomplish our goals, we will pursue three specific aims. In aim one, we will test the hypothesis that p53 is a potent regulator of autophagic stress-induced neural stem cell death through its ability to engage both Puma-dependent and -independent death pathways. Aim two will characterize the molecular pathways involved in hypoxia-ischemia-induced neural stem cell death in the neonatal mouse brain in vivo, a model of human cerebral palsy, and test the hypothesis that p53 regulates neural stem cell death, at least in part, through a transcription-independent action. Aim three will extend our preliminary studies indicating that Puma, in a p53-independent fashion, regulates glucocorticoid-induced neural stem cell death in the neonatal mouse brain, and is a likely contributor to the neurological deficits associated with human premature birth. In total, these proposed studies of novel p53- and/or Puma-dependent neural stem cell death pathways represent an important extension of our highly productive investigations of apoptotic and autophagic cell death pathways and will yield new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell death under physiological and pathological conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neural stem cells control nervous system development and too much, or too little, neural stem cell death is implicated in developmental brain malformations, brain tumor formation, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Defining the molecular pathways regulating neural stem cell death is important for understanding how the nervous system normally develops and identifying molecular targets for therapeutic interventions in a variety of human neuropathological disease states, including cerebral palsy, neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, autism, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",

Recently, influenza virus has been classified as a Select Agent Category C because of the ease of the spread of the virus and its ability to cause great morbidity and mortality. Each year in the USA, in the absence of the introduction of pandemic influenza, the virus kills 36,000 people, hospitalizes 114,000 and causes 70 million missed work days and 38 million lost school days. It is estimated the loss to the economy is $3-15 billion. In years of introduction of pandemic influenza virus (1957 and 1967) approximately 70% of the US population were infected and in 1918/19 the estimate of death associated with Spanish influenza range from 20-40 million (1 in 100 people). The outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in 1997 and 2004/6 with the death of millions of chickens and the very high mortality rate of the limited number of infected humans, gives rise to great concern in the event that the avian virus mutates such that it transmits readily from human to human. Current production methods for vaccines means there is a 5-6 month delay between the time of isolation of a new pathogenic strain of human influenza virus and the widespread distribution of the vaccine. Thus, to protect the world population should H5N1 or any other pandemic strain of influenza virus arise, there is an immediate need to understand the entire process of replication of influenza virus in order to discover new targets for the development of anti-viral drugs. In this grant period we will study the mechanism of assembly and budding of influenza virus, a largely unexplored area. We will analyze the requirements for production of virus-like particles (VLPs) with emphasis on the roles of the cytoplasmic tails of the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and the M2 ion channel as the available evidence indicates there are differences in requirements among HA subtypes, including H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus. We will examine the plasma membrane distribution of HA, NA, M2 and mutants of these proteins by immunogold staining and electron microscopy and examine the localization of the viral membrane (M1) protein by using cell-rip procedures and immunogold staining. We will study the assembly of mutant viruses that contain truncations to the M2 cytoplasmic tails to determine the role of M2 in virus assembly. We will seek cellular proteins that interact with the M1 protein that are involved in influenza virus assembly and budding using multiple approaches including generating stable cell lines that express affinity tagged M1 protein, genome-wide shRNA screens and genome-wide yeast two hybrid experiments. M1 protein interacting partners will be confirmed by biochemistry and functionally by siRNA knock-down experiments.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute viral infections of neurons cause some of the most severe and feared diseases of humans - for instance, rabies, poliomyelitis and, most recently, West Nile virus encephalomyelitis. These diseases are often dramatic in their rapid onset and progression. In those who survive, permanent neurologic deficits often remain. For each of these diseases, neurons are the primary cells that are infected in the central nervous system and both fatal disease and long term sequelae in survivors are caused by virus-induced death of neurons. Remarkable recoveries can also occur, indicating that neuronal infection does not always result in neuronal death. Alphaviruses are important causes of mosquito-borne encephalomyelitis and western, eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses are considered category B agents of bioterrorist concern. VEEV has been weaponized. Sindbis virus (SV) is the prototype alphavirus. The outcome of alphavirus encephalomyelitis is determined by properties of both the host and the infecting virus. The process of neuronal cell death is modulated by the types and maturity of the neurons infected, the virulence of the infecting virus and the quality and rapidity of the host immune response. In this application we will focus on the determinants of virus-induced neuronal cell death using SV encephalitis in mice as a model. We have defined amino acid changes in the structural and nonstructural proteins of SV that are important for virulence, have determined that neuronal lipids play an important role in determining susceptibility of neurons to infection, have identified a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 2 that is a primary determinant of genetic susceptibility to infection, have identified glutamate excitotoxicity as an important determinant of neuronal death during infection and have developed an imaging system that allows us to follow virus replication and spread in individual living animals over time. To better understand the viral and host determinants of the outcome from alphavirus infection we propose the following specific aims: (1) To determine the roles of heparan sulfate-binding and N-linked carbohydrates in neurovirulence; (2) To identify the role of neuronal lipids in determining susceptibility of neural cells to infection; (3) To determine the role of lipid signaling in the death of SV-infected neurons; and (4) To determine the role of activation of poly(ADP-ribose) potymerase in the death of SV-infected neurons.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coxsackie B viruses (CBV) interact with two receptors to initiate infection. All CBV initiate infection by attaching to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR); many CBV isolates also bind to a second receptor, human decay accelerating factor (DAF). CBV, like other enteroviruses, are transmitted by the fecal-oral route in humans, and initiate infection by crossing the intestinal mucosa; however, CAR is not expressed on the apical surface of the polarized epithelial cells that line the intestinal lumen. In the first funding period of this grant, we have found that DAF is essential for infection of polarized cells. DAF permits virus to attach to the cell surface, but more importantly, it induces multiple intracellular signals that are required for virus uptake into the cell. We have found that additional virus-induced signals initiate non-apoptotic cell death by activating calcium-dependent proteases (calpains). Based on these observations, we propose a new series of experiments, focused on virus interaction with DAF, the role of DAF in infection by the enteral route, and the mechanisms and importance of calcium-mediated death signals. 1. We will define the site on the virus surface that permits attachment to DAF, and the site on the DAF molecule responsible for interaction with virus, using site-directed mutagenesis to test a model of the virus-DAF complex recently derived from cryo-em experiments. 2. We will determine whether DAF expression on the epithelial cell surface is important for in vivo infection by the enteral route, using transgenic mice expressing human DAF on intestinal epithelium. 3. We will define the signaling pathway that leads to necrotic cell death in cultured intestinal epithelium, determine whether calpain activation contributes to the pathogenesis of myocarditis and pancreatitis in infected animals, and test whether calpain inhibitors reduce the severity of disease.   Relevance: Enteroviruses are the major cause of viral meningitis, and the second major cause of myocarditis in the US. Understanding how virus interacts with its intestinal receptor as it initiates infection, and understanding the mechanisms of virus-induced cell death, may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a looming threat to human health. A safe and effective vaccine is the best way to prevent large-scale outbreaks in the human population. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, causes kennel cough in dogs, but is not known to cause any illness in humans. PIV5 can be produced in high titers (up to 8x108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml) in many cells including Vero cells, which are WHO approved for vaccine production. PIV5 can infect human cell lines as well as primary human cells. In our preliminary studies, a single dosage of 104 PFU of a live recombinant PIV5 expressing a HA gene from the H3 subtype provided immunity against influenza A virus subtype 3 infection in mice. We hypothesize that PIV5 is a good vector for vaccine development and we propose to test PIV5 as a vector for H5N1 vaccine. We will focus our efforts on following specific aims: 1. Testing recombinant PIV5 expressing HA of H5N1 (PIV5-H5) as a vaccine for H5N1; 2. Testing the potential of other H5N1 proteins expressed using PIV5 as antigens for vaccine; and 3. Testing mutant PIV5 viruses as vaccine vectors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza A virus causes significant morbidity and mortality each year. Strains currently circulating in humans (i.e. H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) infect up to 15% of the world population and cause an average of 36,000 deaths and 226,000 hospitalizations in the United States (28), as well as millions deaths world wide. Sporadic outbreaks of pandemic influenza have caused significant mortality over the past century, most notably the Spanish flu of 1918, and have caused over 50 million deaths world wide. On the horizon is another potentially pandemic strain of influenza, H5N1. This avian influenza virus has most notably emerged in Southeast Asia and resulted in the destruction of millions of birds, infected 309 people, caused 187 human fatalities since 2003 (WHO, Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO, 31 May 2007), and threatens to become the next pandemic.     Currently, the only FDA-approved vaccine against H5N1 has serious limitations, particularly as it has to be given twice and requires substantial higher concentrations of the vaccine to achieve a moderate level of efficacy compared to conventional influenza vaccines. Conventional vaccines utilizing the HA and NA of H5N1 viruses have been poorly immunogenic and have safety and production issues. A live-attenuated H5N1 vaccine has been generated by reverse genetics, but the risk of generating a reassortant prohibits use of this vaccine in most instances. Inactivated virus vaccines have also been derived by reverse genetics and produced in large quantities, but preliminary results from NIAID clinical trials suggest that efficacy will require both multiple immunizations and 6 times the standard influenza virus antigen dose, i.e. 90 ug instead of 15 ug of antigen while only providing protection in a subset (~50%) of vaccinated individuals. Nonetheless, FDA has recently approved the inactivated H5N1 vaccine for use in people between age 18 and 64, an age group that is not the most vulnerable to influenza virus infection. Thus, there is a rationale need for new vaccine strategies that provide increased immunogenicity and safety.     Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, causes kennel cough in dogs, but is not known to cause any illness in humans. PIV5 can be produced in high titers (up to 8x108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml) in many cells including Vero cells, which are WHO-approved for vaccine production. PIV5 can infect human cell lines as well as primary human cells. In our preliminary studies, a single dosage of 104 PFU of a live recombinant PIV5 expressing a HA gene from the H3 subtype provided immunity against influenza A virus subtype 3 infection in mice. In this proposal, we hypothesize that PIV5 is a good vector for vaccine development and we propose to test PIV5 as a vector for H5N1 vaccine.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection worldwide and the primary infectious cause of serious birth defects in newborns. HCMV has long been recognized as an infectious threat to the fetus, particularly in women without HCMV immunity and who have a primary HCMV infection during pregnancy. The major source of infection for pregnant women are children with subclincal HCMV infection. Children that become infected congenitally or perinatally shed virus for longer periods of time and at higher titers than people that acquire HCMV later in life. The mechanism(s), why children who acquire the virus early in prenatal or post-natal life shed the virus longer and in higher titers are not known. Considering the severe health risks associated with congenital HCMV infection, breaking the chain of transmission from subclinically infected children to pregnant women to fetuses would have important benefits for human health. This requires a better understanding of virus-host interactions in very young children as compared to adults. For ethical reasons, studies in newborns are very limited. Thus, we propose to develop a nonhuman primate model of infant HCMV infection by orally infecting infant macaques with rhesus CMV (RhCMV) (Aim 1). A model of HCMV pathogenesis in adult macaques has been developed and closely mimics HCMV infection in humans. The establishment of an infant model of RhCMV infection will provide us with the opportunity to define differences in specific immune responses to RhCMV infection between infants and adults while keeping the virus inoculum, the dose, and the route of transmission constant. The underlying assumption is that long-term virological outcome in HCMV infected patients depends on the earliest virus-host interactions. As the infant immune system is less mature, the overall HCMV response is less likely to control virus replication. HCMV-specific CD4+T cells have been implicated to play an essential role in the control of virus replication. Thus, we present the hypothesis that a limited functional capacity of infant CD4+T cells, as assessed by reduced IFN-g production, combined with higher frequencies of regulatory T cells in infants interfere with the development of effective HCMV-specific CD4+T cells (Aim 2). This hypothesis will be tested in the infant macaque model of RhCMV infection established in Aim 1. The results of the proposed studies should be of broader importance for understanding infant immune responses to other infectious agents and how to prevent a pathogenic outcome in children. Thus, a nonhuman primate model of infant HCMV infection would be a unique resource to test the efficacy and safety of pediatric antiviral therapies and HCMV vaccines.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection worldwide and is the primary infectious cause of serious birth defects in newborns. Children with sublinical HCMV infection are the major source for HCMV infection in pregnant women because HCMV infected children shed virus for a longer time and at higher titers that people that acquire HCMV later in life. We propose to develop a nonhuman primate model of infant HCMV infection to advance our understanding of the age-related differences in HCMV pathogenesis in infants and adults with the longterm goal of breaking the chain of transmission from subclinically infected children to pregnant women to fetuses.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ebola virus is one of the most lethal infectious threats to mankind. These infections cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and non-human primates and produce mortality rates of up to 90%. Ebola virus is classified in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda for CDC as a Category A Agent (USDHHS-NIH) and is a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. There are four species of the Ebola virus, and there is currently no vaccine or antiviral therapy against Ebola virus infections for humans. The elusive nature of the natural reservoir makes eradication of the agent impossible and elevates the control of this virus and bioterrorist threat through vaccination or therapeutic means to a level of paramount importance. Currently, only heroic, symptomatic measures are available for the treatment of Ebola infections. The overall goal of this research is to address this critical need by developing small molecule, orally active antidotes to Ebola virus infections, which can be used prophylactically or in the 4-16 day post-infection period when fever and hemorrhagic symptoms of disease are present. The cysteine proteinase cathepsin L, a lysosomal enzyme, has been reported recently to be a new target for inhibition of SARS virus infections. Furthermore, inhibitors of cathepsin L can prevent SARS coronavirus entry into target cells. Ebola virus and SARS virus both employ cathepsin L activity for viral entry and cathepsin L is strongly implicated in the processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Our strategy is to take advantage of this discovery to develop inhibitors of this new anti-Ebola target, cathepsin L, which is required for virus entry. This innovative approach involves targeting a host enzyme rather than a viral component. In preliminary studies, we built a pseudovirus carrying the Ebola glycoprotein, which can be studied under BSL2 containment, and demonstrated the capability of the pseudovirus to infect 293T cells. With an initial set of cathepsin L inhibitors, we demonstrated (i) potent and selective cathepsin L inhibitory activity versus recombinant enzyme and (ii) cell-contained enzyme; (iii) lack of cytotoxicity; and (iv) inhibition of pseudotype Ebola virus entry into 293T cells. These results validate this host enzyme at the cellular level as a target for anti-Ebola therapy for the first time. In Phase I, we will design and build new potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin L by rational drug design and structure-based drug design methods, employing a rapid sensitive fluorescence assay for cathepsin L inhibition and inhibitor-enzyme co-crystal structures. We will prioritize the most potent inhibitors for their selectivity (eg, minimal affinity for cathepsin B and calpain), minimal cytotoxicity, cell permeability, favorable ADME properties and efficacy in an Ebola pseudotype assay as well as a virulent wild-type Ebola virus tested in a BSL4 facility. We will establish Proof of Concept by demonstrating the activity of pseudotype virus inhibitors in an infectious Ebola virus plaque assay in a BSL4 containment facility at USMARIID. In Phase II, these leads will be developed into preclinical candidates and in vivo IND enabling efficacy and pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies will be performed.     Ebola virus infections constitute one of the most severe threats of infection to mankind. The natural reservoir for the Ebola virus is unknown, which increases the need for therapeutic intervention. This proposal describes a rational approach for the preparation of small molecule inhibitors of Ebola virus infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Project Summary: Research on efficacious adolescent substance abuse interventions over the past two decades has consistently demonstrated heterogeneity of response to treatment. Key challenges for the .field include understanding these various response trajectories and establishing strategies to adapt treatments to enhance their effectiveness for those who are not responsive to standard interventions. Such research is critically needed to inform treatment services providers on optimal care strategies. An important advance in treatment services research efforts is the increasing movement away from a  one-size-fits-all  perspective inherent in standardized interventions and a call for the development of adaptive interventions that incorporate treatment algorithms to aid clinical decision-making. The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) outlines a process whereby a series of randomizations within an individual study is used to create an optimal adaptive intervention. We propose two studies to examine the efficacy of eight potential adaptive treatment strategies using the SMART design. Study 1 goals are twofold (1) to examine which of two distinct sets of criteria for defining early treatment response (abstinence vs. minimal use) is the best guide for subsequent treatment decisions, i.e., how best to determine when response to a minimal treatment intervention is  good enough  for an adolescent to step out of treatment without risking a significant relapse. (2) to determine which of two stepped adaptive interventions result in better outcomes for treatment non-responders and relapsers: an enhanced version of the same treatment or a new treatment? Participants (n=80) will receive an initial dose of treatment consisting of MET/CBT8. At completion, participants will be randomly assigned, in sequential steps, to one of two treatment response criteria and, if needed, one of two stepped interventions. Pre- to post-treatment outcomes will be examined using the SMART protocol framework to identify the specific clinical components comprising the optimal adaptive treatment strategy in response to a particular treatment outcome. Study 2 is a pilot (n=60) test of the efficacy of the optimal adaptive strategy identified in Study 1 vs. a standard MET/CBT 12 group intervention, with follow up assessments at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Relevance: This research will provide a systematic set of optimal decision rules for treatment agencies on how best to proceed when adolescents receiving an initial course of MET/CBT8 show initial treatment response, persist in their substance use, or demonstrate an initial treatment response followed by later relapse. This type of  practical  clinical trial begins the long overdue process of addressing critical gaps between traditional treatment efficacy research and key questions that emerge in clinical practice such as determining when adolescents have received sufficient treatment, how to proceed when initial treatment efforts are not effective, and how best to address relapse. Mechanisms of change will also be examined in Study 2.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant challenge for the development of new influenza vaccines is to identify strategies that can both accelerate vaccine production and protect against the emergence of epidemic and pandemic strains. This proposal will develop a DNA vaccine to meet these needs. DNA vaccines can be rapidly designed and manufactured to express multiple antigens and induce antibody and cell-mediated protection against distant drift variants. This proposal will employ particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED) of the DNA vaccine and builds on the recent success of a seasonal influenza PMED DNA vaccine that induced protective levels of antibody in vaccinated subjects in a phase I human clinical trial. The purpose of this proposal is to increase PMED DNA vaccine immunogenicity and further develop the vaccine as a pandemic flu product. The primary objectives of the proposal are to: 1) Broaden the specificity of the vaccine against genetically drifted strains and avian influenza by including multiple HA sequences. 2) Investigate the effects of including a nucleoprotein (NP) gene in the multivalent DNA vaccine with sequences modified and optimized to increase the breadth and potency of CD8+ T cell responses against highly conserved regions of the gene. 3) Determine if a novel genetic adjuvant that we have shown enhances antibody and cellular immune responses against other DNA vaccine antigens will similarly increase the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the candidate pandemic influenza DNA vaccine. The vaccine will be tested for immunogenicity in the highly relevant ferret and nonhuman primate preclinical models. A model in rhesus macaques will be developed to take advantage of the information available on the Class I locus of this species required for analysis of T cell immunity. Aerosolized influenza challenges will be employed so that protective efficacy against homologous and drifted strains of avian influenza can be evaluated in a setting that mimics natural exposure in the population. These efforts will generate three candidate DNA vaccine products that induce antibody and cellular immune responses for protection against both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza. These experiments will also test the hypothesis that vaccine induction of CD8+ T cell responses against conserved regions of the virus will increase protective efficacy against HA-drift variants and provide critical protection against mortality caused by emerging pandemic strains of influenza viruses.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States alone, annual influenza epidemics cause approximately 30,000 deaths each year, mostly among the elderly. In addition, periodic pandemics result from the emergence of novel influenza viruses through antigenic shift. In pandemic years, the virus efficiently infects most of the human population due to a lack of pre-existing immunity against the hemagglutinin of the pandemic strain. Three influenza pandemics have occurred in the last century, in 1918, 1957 and 1968, and in each case mortality and morbidity far exceeded those in epidemic years. In fact, the most severe of the three pandemic episodes (in1918) is estimated to have caused greater than 40 million deaths. Although it is not possible to predict when the next influenza pandemic will occur, that there will be a new pandemic is almost certain. The potentially devastating effects of this event could be prevented with the fast production and distribution of an effective vaccine designed to protect against the pandemic virus. Prototype pandemic vaccines developed to date require multiple high doses to induce protective responses in humans. With such a vaccine, it would be impossible to generate sufficient supplies to promptly immunize the entire population using current manufacturing technology. In addition, more effective vaccines are needed to control epidemic influenza in high risk populations, where the success rate of vaccination with currently approved vaccines is low. We propose to investigate a novel concept for the design of improved influenza virus vaccines based on modification of the viral NS1 gene to generate live attenuated vaccine strains. We have previously shown that the NS1 gene of influenza virus is responsible for inhibition of type I IFN production. We therefore hypothesize that NS1-modified influenza virus vaccines will be attenuated and will stimulate potent innate and adaptive immune responses due to their IFN-inducing properties. Thus, H3N2 and H5N1 viruses containing truncations of their NS1 genes will be generated by reverse genetics as prototype vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza in humans. The recombinant viruses will be evaluated in preclinical models for their ability to protect against influenza virus infection. In addition, H5N1-based vaccines will be tested for their ability to protect poultry, in order to assess their utility on poultry farms. The immune responses induced by NS1-modified influenza virus vaccines will be characterized in detail, providing insight into the mechanisms of virulence of wild-type influenza virus strains. We hypothesize that the NS1 protein of influenza virus is responsible for a suboptimal immune response after virus infection, and that the NS1- muntant viruses will have increased immunogenicity. We will also explore innovative approaches to eliminate the potential for reassortment between live vaccine viruses and circulating strains that could result in the acquisition of virulence. Finally, in collaboration with GreenHills Biotechnology, we will optimize cell culture techniques for the large-scale production of NS1-modified influenza virus vaccines suitable for use in humans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dengue virus is endemic throughout tropical regions of the world and threatens over half of the world's population. A vaccine that can protect against infection by all four of the dengue viruses (serotypes DEN-1 through DEN-4) is a critical global health need. The attenuated DEN-2 virus has been shown to be safe, potent and effective, generating long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses in human clinical trials. The mutations that weaken the virus have been characterized and lie outside the DEN-2 structural genes. The attenuated virus has been used as a backbone to express the structural genes of DEN-1, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Each  chimeric  virus bears the distinctive attenuation markers of the original DEN-2 parent and is safe and effective in animal models. Mixing the parent attenuated DEN-2 virus with the three chimeric viruses generates a tetravalent vaccine that can induce immune responses against all four dengue serotypes. We propose to complete the preclinical development of this unique vaccine. We will generate and characterize viral seed stocks required for manufacture of the vaccine. We will undertake formulation studies to optimize the activity of the vaccine. We will test the final, formulated vaccine in critical dengue models. We will develop both industry standard and unique assays to assure the safety, identity and potency of our vaccine. Finally, we will manufacture sufficient quantities of the vaccine to initiate human clinical trials. To achieve these goals, we have formed an international consortium of vaccine and dengue specialists from biotechnology, academia, and government institutions. To facilitate delivery of this vaccine to those that need it most, our unique collaboration includes an Indian manufacturer that globally supplies WHO-approved vaccines. Development of an affordable, safe and effective dengue vaccine will protect those that live in or travel to Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa and Australia.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research in immunology and virology has made enormous progress toward the design of an effective vaccine to prevent Hepatitis C infection, but multidisciplinary efforts are needed to move these designs to the ultimate manufacture of a cost-effective vaccine for global immunization. This proposed Cooperative Research Center (CRC) will critically evaluate a new means to biomanufacture HCV antigens known to induce specific immune responses to HCV - identified through human clinical studies, and predicted to be important in viral clearance - and evaluate responses to these antigens in appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems. One of the co-Directors of this CRC has lead Chiron's discovery of recombinant antigens from HCV; the evaluation of his currently available suite of proteins in clinical trials indicates that a prophylactic and immunotherapeutic vaccine is feasible. Unfortunately, at least from the standpoint of manufacturing for public health markets, the optimal vaccine should consist of a  cocktail  of multiple antigens to elicit both antibody-mediated and T cell-mediated immune responses. The likely need for two separate protein expression systems to produce this vaccine, one limited by low yields, raises obstacles to commercial development - especially for global use. To overcome these production constraints, this CRC proposes to rapidly utilization current understanding of the properties of important vaccine components to develop and validate a new biomanufacturing system for multiple HCV antigens. A unique feature of this proposed CRC will be the use of green plants as versatile, highly cost-effective production system for  recombinant proteins. The research proposed is an interactive partnership that draws upon Chiron's vaccine development expertise to critically evaluate HCV candidate vaccines produced by an academic team that has pioneered the use of plant biotechnology for subunit vaccine manufacture for more than a decade.    PROJECT 1: Plant- Derived Envelope Glycoprotein E1/E2 Vaccine for HCV (Mason, H.)     PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major worldwide agent of acute and chronic hepatitis, with over 3% of the world's population infected and at risk for liver cirrhosis and cancer, and a US cost burden of $1 billion per year.  Studies showed that vaccine development should target both antibody and T-cell mediated immunity.  Recombinant envelope glycoproteins gpE1 and gpE2 are the leading vaccine candidates for antibody-mediated protection, showing protection in chimpanzee.  However, gpE1/gpE2 is currently produced in cultured mammalian cells, with a limited capacity for scale-up to achieve global immunization.  Alternatively, production of gpE1/gpE2 in plant systems has the potential for vast scale-up.  We hypothesize that:  1) HCV gpE1/gpE2 vaccine can be produced in a plant system in a form that is equivalent to the mammalian cell product used for injection; 2) HCV gpE1/gpE2 vaccine can be scaled up to a commercially competitive level using a leaf or a grain seed-based expression system; and 3) Plant-derived HCV gpE1/gpE2 can stimulate antibody responses when orally delivered by ingestion of minimally processed plant tissue.  The specific aims of this proposal will address these questions by using plant-optimized gpE1/gpE2 genes expressed in plants to assess the potential to assemble immunogenic gpE1/gpE2 heterodimers.  We will examine tobacco leaf and corn seed expression systems and evaluate gpE1/gpE2 accumulation and quality to select the optimal system.  M. Houghton at Chiron Corporation leads their HCV vaccine effort and will direct Project 3 of this HCV Research Center, which will purify gpE1/gpE2 from plant sources and test its immunogenic capacity in animal models.  We will furthermore test the potential for use of orally delivered plant-derived gpE1/gpE2 vaccine, with the aim to develop a convenient and economical vaccine for the developing world.  If successful, these studies will greatly enhance the capacity to produce an injectable vaccine for HCV, while also offering the possibility to improve worldwide immunization coverage with an oral vaccine.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need is pressing to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the primary objective of arresting the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Design of such efficacious vaccines will be facilitated by the elucidation of immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection. We have conducted vaccination studies in rhesus macaques to evaluate a plasmid DNA containing a vif-deleted SIVmac239 provirus (SIVvif provirus) as a proviral DNA vaccine. Furthermore we investigated the adjuvant activity of a rhesus macaque interleukin (IL)-15 expression plasmid when co-inoculated with the SIV?vif proviral DNA. Findings from these studies indicated that co-immunization with an IL-15 plasmid expression vector affords a significant adjuvant effect to the SIV vif-deleted proviral DNA vaccine and enhanced protection against vaginal challenge with pathogenic SIVmac251. Furthermore, examination of SIV-specific cellular immune responses by interferon-? ELISpot and T cell proliferation assays revealed a significant enhancement of interferon-? ELISpot responses by inclusion of IL-15 as an adjuvant for the proviral DNA vaccine. These NIH-funded vaccine studies have now been concluded. We propose to further examine virus-specific cellular immune responses from cryopreserved PBMC samples banked from these same vaccine studies, using a 10 color multi-parameter flow cytometric assay. This assay will evaluate SIV-induced T cell intracellular expression of cytokines including interferon-?, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interleukin-2 and also test for expression of specific cell surface markers for cytotoxic T cell degranulation (CD107a), CD8 T cell memory development (CD127 or IL-7 receptor a) and a negative immunoregulatory protein (program death 1/PD-1). This type of immune response assessment was not described in the original NIH proposal that funded these SIV?vif DNA vaccine studies. However, this investigation is now well justified by observations from these studies and by recent reports showing the utility of these functional profiles to elucidate immune correlates that are critical for vaccine design. The hypothesis is that implementation of novel tools for comprehensive immune response analysis in macaques vaccinated with SIV?vif proviral DNA with or without IL-15 expression plasmid, will elucidate an immune correlate(s) for IL-15 adjuvant activity and vaccine-induced control of virus load. Furthermore, Il-15 has been considered as a potential immunotherapeutic for patients on HAART. Accordingly, careful elucidation of cellular immune responses associated with a potentially effective cytokine adjuvant such as IL-15 may impact design of future HIV-1 vaccines and therapeutics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings from recent studies in monkey animal models, suggested that including a lymphocyte growth factor designated interleukin (IL)-15, as part of the highly attenuated SIV?vif DNA vaccine, improved the effectiveness of this vaccine. However standard tests for vaccine-induced immune responses did not identify a specific cause or mechanism by which IL-15 improved the vaccine. We propose to further examine virus-specific cellular immune responses using new technologies developed over the past decade, to identify mechanisms by which IL-15 improved this DNA vaccine. Findings from these studies may then be used for future design for more effective HIV-1 vaccines, as well as design for immunotherapeutics for HIV-1 infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can lead to chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies for chronic HBV infection are only moderately effective, and are limited by severe side effects and viral resistance. Thus, there remains a need for new therapies for this serious disease. The host T cell response to HBV is vigorous and multi-specific in acutely infected people who clear the virus, but it is weak and narrowly focused in those who become chronically infected. Therapeutic vaccination to induce an immune response sufficient to control the virus is a possible new approach for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Unfortunately; the current HBV vaccine is not effective for therapeutic vaccination. Although it produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that prevents infection, it does not induce the potent CD8 T cell response needed to eliminate the virus after infection. The current vaccine is also not optimal for widespread prophylactic vaccination in endemic underdeveloped regions of the world, as it does not induce protection in all individuals, the protective antibody response decreases over time, and multiple doses are required for long-lasting immunity. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine vectors induce strong protective CD8 T cell and antibody responses to a variety of pathogens, and are also showing promise as therapeutic vaccines. We will test the hypothesis that recombinant VSV expressing the HBV structural proteins will make effective vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic immunization against HBV. We will generate recombinant VSV vaccine vectors that express HBV proteins, characterize the immune response to VSV/HBV in vaccinated animals, and determine if VSV/HBV vaccine vectors induce an effective immune response in mouse models of chronic HBV. An improved prophylactic vaccine that provides long-term immunity in a single dose or an effective therapeutic vaccine would have the potential to prevent millions of cases of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.    Public Health Relevance: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection leads to millions of deaths each year worldwide from liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies for HBV infection are only moderately effective, and are often accompanied by severe side effects and viral resistance. An improved prophylactic vaccine and/or an effective therapeutic vaccine would have the potential to prevent millions of cases of HBV-associated liver cancer.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Lassa vaccine in primates with AIDS Lassa fever virus is a rodent-borne scourge in West Africa and, less has been classified as a Category A biothreat in the US because of its lethality and aerosol-transmissibility. Efforts to control Lassa fever focus largely on vaccine development, because the disease course is exceptionally rapid and effective therapies are usually too late. We developed a candidate attenuated vaccine, MOP/LAS that is a reassortant between Lassa Josiah strain and the avirulent Mopeia strain. It is an attenuated, infectious vaccine that protects guinea pigs from lethal challenge with Lassa fever virus. As part of our vaccine development plan, we want to understand the interactions between this Lassa fever vaccine and HIV, since these pathogens are endemic in the same regions of sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we employ the SIV/macaque model for AIDS to simulate the immune-suppressed state of persons living with HIV. Our goal is to determine whether an attenuated arenavirus vaccine could be safe and immunogenic in macaques with SIV disease. These studies will touch on a broader issue that arose recently when 3 organ transplant recipients died due to LCMV infection of the transplanted tissue, thus raising the possibility that an ordinarily benign arenavirus can become virulent in immune-suppressed hosts. Our hypothesis is that an attenuated vaccine strain will not become more virulent in an AIDS- immunosupressed host. We propose to test this hypothesis in SIV-infected monkeys remaining from completed AIDS studies, and we will use criteria for virulent and benign arenavirus infections developed in our previous macaque studies. Our specific aims are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that an attenuated Lassa vaccine (MOP/LAS) will remain attenuated in macaques where immunity is suppressed during SIV-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2) Test the hypothesis that AIDS monkeys given an attenuated arenavirus will develop robust immune responses to vaccine antigens. Our long-term goal is to deliver a vaccine against Lassa fever to West Africa, and to derive from these studies basic information on immune responses to vaccination in the context of AIDS. A successful Lassa fever vaccine should be safe and available to persons with HIV, and Lassa vaccination programs must anticipate any effect of endemic HIV on vaccine performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Lassa vaccine in primates with AIDS Lassa fever virus causes a deadly disease in man and is a serious public health threat in West Africa. Though it can potentially be used in biowarfare, this family of viruses are not a serious health threat in the US (except for the rare incidence of lethal contamination for transplant patients). We developed a vaccine that successfully protected guinea pigs. We have the chance to test the vaccine in monkeys left over from an AIDS experiment, and this test will address the safety of our vaccines in people with AIDS. This is an important question since the Lassa endemic region of West Africa also has a high incidence of AIDS.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and > 1 million deaths annually, is responsible for a loss of > 1.3% of GDP in Africa annually, and is a serious concern for travelers and the military. A vaccine would be the ideal preventive and is perhaps the only intervention that could facilitate eradication of the disease. When attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) are administered by bite of infected mosquitoes, > 90% of human volunteers are protected against experimental Pf challenge and protection lasts at least 10 months. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize an attenuated PfSPZ vaccine that produces > 90% protective efficacy, for 3 markets with a potential for > $1 billion annual revenues; 1) Travelers from the developed world, 2) Infants and young children in the developing world, and 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. In a separate Phase II SBIR and with other funds Sanaria has developed and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) the PfSPZ vaccine using the cryopreservation and irradiation methods developed in our Phase I SBIR. The vaccine met all release specifications, is now in pre-clinical IND-enabling toxicology studies, and is expected to enter clinical trials in the U.S. by the last quarter of 2008. The goals of this proposal are to facilitate rapid testing in Africa by translating the successful cryopreservation protocol developed in Phase I, into a comprehensive system to support clinical trials in Africa, and to facilitate scale up, large scale Phase 3 clinical trials, and vaccine launch by establishing the capacity for scaled-up vaccine production in the area of cryopreservation. This proposal has 2 major components, 1) Work designed to provide the foundation for vaccine distribution in expanded Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and during commercialization (Specific Aims 1-3), and 2) Work designed to scale up vaccine production for Phase 3 trials and commercialization (Specific Aims 4-6). The Specific Aims are to: 1. Develop methods for storage, inventory control and recovery of vaccine batches for shipment and use in clinical trials; 2. Establish and validate a below -140oC cold chain for all vaccine movements and all transit points between site of vaccine manufacture and testing centers in the U.S., and expansion of methods and infrastructure for vaccine delivery to Africa; 3. Establish in-clinic protocols for thawing and diluting cryopreserved vaccine and preparation for injection, and development and validation of vaccine point-of-administration protocols for use under conditions in Africa; 4. Extend vaccine viability and potency during cryopreservation steps; 5. Create initial daily cryopreserved vaccine production sub-lots, which are then combined into single large vaccine lots, and 6. Automate the protocol for cryopreserving large vaccine lots. These Aims will include establishing quality GMP/GCP control procedures as units of vaccine move to the clinic. There is an urgent need to extensively test the PfSPZ vaccine in Africa as soon as possible. Achievement of the Aims of this proposal will facilitate this testing and decrease time and cost to registration of the PfSPZ vaccine, thereby facilitating delivery of the vaccine to the African children, who need it most.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria causes 500 million clinical cases and 1-3 million deaths annually, is responsible for >1% loss of GDP in Africa annually and is a serious concern for travelers and military personnel. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a >90% protective malaria vaccine for three primary markets with a potential for >$1 billion annual revenues: 1) Travelers from the developed world to malaria endemic areas. 2) Infants and young children in the developing world. 3) Adolescent girls in the developing world. Success in this project will significantly increase the capacity to produce larger vaccine lots at the same time decreasing cost of production; will establish routes for delivery of the vaccine to clinical trials sites in the USA and, importantly, to the populations at need in Africa.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to develop nanoparticle-based vaccines against West Nile virus. West Nile virus is an emerging human pathogen and a model for other medically important flaviviruses such as dengue virus. We and others have shown that a recombinant subunit vaccine consisting of a truncated form of the flaviviral envelope protein can protect animals from otherwise lethal viral challenges. Here we propose to encapsulate recombinant envelope proteins in biodegradable nanoparticulate cores fabricated from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) which have been modified to incorporate immune modulators. Our hypothesis is that this formulation will overcome many weaknesses found in traditional approaches to recombinant subunit vaccine development. First, the formulated antigen is expected to be stable at room temperature for extended periods of time. Second, vaccination can occur with a needle-free procedure (oral or intranasal administration). Finally, our results have shown that immunization with PLGA particles elicits a strong cellular immune response, an essential mechanism to fully eliminate infectious virus. We will synthesize PLGA particles including the envelope protein from West Nile virus. The PLGA particles will include varying concentrations of CpG oligonucleotides as an adjuvant. We will then immunize mice, subcutaneously, orally, and intranasally, with the PLGA preparations. We will vary the number of immunizations and the dose of vaccine administered. The immune response will be characterized in detail. In particular, we will monitor the appearance of virus-neutralizing antibodies as well as virus-specific T cells. We will verify that the immunization is also effective in a distinct strain of mice. Furthermore, we will evaluate the stability of the nanoparticles during storage. Finally, mice immunized with our vaccine against West Nile virus will be challenged with an otherwise lethal dose of live virus. We expect to find that vaccinated animals now survive such a challenge.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Flaviviruses such as West Nile virus and dengue virus cause significant human disease and death. We propose to develop a vaccine against diseases caused by these viruses. The vaccine antigen would be a recombinant protein derived from the viral envelope, and would be encapsulated in nanoparticles. This would allow us to administer the vaccine orally or intranasally.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza pandemics occur when an abrupt change in the composition of the circulating viruses results in a strain to which individuals have little or no immunity. The three pandemic outbreaks that occurred in the 20th century in 1918, 1957, and 1968 represent three different antigenic subtypes of influenza A virus: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, respectively. The concern of a future pandemic has focused attention on the avian H5N1 virus, which has demonstrated not only the possibility of infecting humans but to do so with a high case-fatality rate. Vaccinating populations to protect them from a future pandemic virus poses an obvious problem. David Nabarro, UN senior coordinator for avian and human influenza, stated:  We cannot have a vaccine against a pandemic virus until the pandemic virus appears and then there will be an interval of perhaps six months until we have a reasonable quantity of vaccine.  Efforts are underway to create pre-pandemic vaccines to H5N1 viruses that can confer broad protection against different strains. However, the divergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses into distinct clades has increased the complexity of developing a prophylactic vaccine against multiple H5N1 subtypes. We propose here a novel way to approach this problem, using the power of directed molecular evolution. This technology encompasses a method for creating novel protein sequences coupled with a means of screening the protein variants. In vitro homologous DNA recombination can create libraries of high-quality functional diversity from pathogen genes encoding the proteins needed to create a vaccine. Libraries of the variant proteins can then be screened for improved immunogenicity. The only major correlate of protection against influenza is antibody to its surface glycoproteins, primarily the hemagglutinin (HA). We hypothesize that variants of the H5 HA protein can be created that are more immunogenic than the wild-type proteins, and will induce immune sera with potentially broad neutralization potency. Genes encoding the variants to test this hypothesis will be created by in vitro DNA recombination of wildtype H5 HA-encoding genes. The specific product that is being targeted by this work is an HA-based vaccine with broad neutralization activity against many H5N1 viruses. The creation of a stockpile of variants and the sera induced by them will nonetheless provide a means to rapidly choose the immunogen needed to prepare a vaccine once a pandemic strain has appeared. The current proposal will assess the feasibility of this idea. A study by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the consequences of a severe pandemic could include 200 million people infected, 90 million clinically ill, and 2 million dead in the United States alone. If a pandemic is caused by H5N1, the numbers of deaths could be considerably higher given the observed >50% case-fatality rate for infection by this virus. A strategy such as that proposed here could - if successful - provide a measure of protection against a pandemic H5 influenza strain and potentially save millions of lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza pandemics occur when individuals are poorly protected from the virus. We propose to create a collection of vaccine candidates that can rapidly be tested against an emerging pandemic. A strategy such as that proposed here could provide protection against a pandemic flu virus and save millions of lives.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection is a major problem for the 5 to 6 million Americans with chronic wounds because it interferes with the normal healing process and increases the risk of serious complications that often necessitate limb amputation or result in death. A significant obstacle to the successful treatment of chronic wounds is the inability to correctly diagnose infection. Most clinicians still rely on visual signs and symptoms that are indicative of infection in acute or surgical wounds but have been proven to be inaccurate for diagnosis of infection in chronic wounds. The primary objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate a novel diagnostic test that will better enable physicians or nurses to detect chronic wound infection at the point-of- care. Our overall objective is produce a simple, single-use diagnostic device for hospitals, wound care clinics, outpatient centers, and long-term care facilities. The device will give a visible, yes-or-no result within 15 minutes when the bacterial concentration within the wound exceeds a level demonstrated to be indicative of infection. This would benefit public health by assisting individuals with chronic wounds to receive the appropriate treatment sooner, which will accelerate the healing process, relieve their suffering and discomfort, and lower the risk of infectious complications. Our Phase I objectives focused on the development of a functional diagnostic assay that was demonstrated to detect bacteria in chronic wounds with excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to standard microbiological techniques. Our Phase II specific aims are focused on improvement and validation of the diagnostic test. The first aim is to evaluate a more accurate and reliable method of collecting tissue fluid from chronic wounds. This will help to reduce variability in the sample volume collected, which will improve diagnostic accuracy of the test. Our second objective is to change the assay readout from a quantitative ELISA format into a binary lateral flow-based test. An important step in this process is setting the appropriate threshold for the lateral flow line development using validated standards. Lastly, we plan to evaluate the diagnostic performance of test with samples from patients within the three major chronic wounds types: diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers. Results of the diagnostic test will be compared to a reference standard for diagnosis of chronic wound infection to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. The data from this clinical study will evaluate the ability of the diagnostic test to detect chronic wound infection and will demonstrate clinical utility of the device. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project goal is to develop a simple, inexpensive point-of-care diagnostic test to help clinicians rapidly determine if a chronic wound is infected. Earlier and more accurate infection diagnosis will allow patients to receive the appropriate treatment sooner, resulting in less pain and suffering and a lower risk of serious infection-related complications.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is responsive to PA-07-089 HIV Infection of the Central Nervous System and partially responsive to: PA-07-338 HIV Treatment Adherence Research. Co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a burgeoning healthcare concern, as approximately one third of all HIV-infected patients in the United States are co-infected with HCV. Infection with HIV and HCV can give rise to a host of cognitive, psychiatric and central nervous system abnormalities. Increasingly, there is reason to believe that HCV, even in the absence of HIV or other cormorbid conditions, is itself neuropathogenic. The main treatment for HCV is pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV). Treatment success is linked to whether patients can tolerate prescribed dosages and duration of therapy. Research has yet to focus on whether patients may miss or skip doses, an analogous situation to what has been well studied in HIV mono-infection. Given the relatively low rates of sustaining HCV remission (approximately 40-50%) and given the difficulty of taking a potent combination of medications for a sustained period of time (most will be on treatment for 48 weeks), it is reasonable to assume that suboptimal adherence might share some responsibility for treatment failure. This five year longitudinal study seeks to determine: (1) The impact of treatment with PEG- IFN/RBV on neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and neuroimaging parameters and the degree to which comorbid HIV infection alters this response; (2) whether participants who achieve a SVR demonstrate statistically and clinically significant improvements in neuro-function compared to baseline performance and (3) the degree to which adherence to participants' anti-HCV medication regimen impacts neural function as well as the likelihood of obtaining a sustained virologic response. We are particularly interested in determining how (or if) co-morbid HIV infection alters the expression of treatment related neuro-changes. We will enroll 330 participants, 165 who are HIV/HCV co-infected and 165 who are HCV mono-infected in order to obtain an ultimate sample of 200 participants who complete therapy. Study participants will be evaluated with a series of neuropsychological and psychiatric measures prior to beginning treatment, 12 weeks after treatment has been initiated, and then 12 weeks following treatment completion. A nested cohort will undergo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at each study timepoint. We will employ growth modeling and multiple group path analysis as the primary analytic techniques. Project Narrative: Co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is increasingly recognized as a pressing public health concern as the number of deaths due to HCV will soon outpace deaths due to HIV in the United States. While there are medications for HCV that are frequently effective, these drugs are also toxic and may adversely affect brain function and cause problems with medication adherence. This study will determine how co-infection with both HIV and HCV affects the brain, how treatment for HCV affects brain function, and how adherence to HCV medications affects response to treatment and neurological functions. Of particular interest is how HIV co-infection affects response to treatment.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Medication treatments for opiate addiction or abuse are available and effective, but each has real or perceived drawback that result in low acceptability. As a result, the vast majority of opiate addicts or abusers are not receiving pharmacotherapy for this disorder. Additional treatment options might increase the number of opiate users interested in treatment. The overall aim of this study is to develop and evaluate an opiate vaccine in rats as a potential treatment for opiate addiction or abuse. Vaccines which alter drug pharmacokinetics have shown substantial preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence of efficacy for nicotine and cocaine addiction, and several heroin vaccines have shown promise in animal models. Challenges for translating this approach to clinical use for opiate addiction include 1) providing efficacy against the wide range of commonly abused opiates, 2) avoiding blockade of key opiates needed for potential medical use, and 3) providing sufficient antibody titers to block the effects of the large doses of opiates used by addicts. We hypothesize that a multivalent opiate vaccine (MOpV) consisting of 3 immunogens, each targeting a specific group of structurally related opiates, can be designed which will attenuate the effects of a broad range of opiates yet avoid blocking non-targeted opiates. Potential advantages of an opiate vaccine, as an additional treatment option, include a long duration of action, lack of agonist effects (for those with real or perceived objections to taking an addictive medication), a novel mechanism of action and the possibility of being combined with existing medications to augment compliance or efficacy, and use in developing countries which lack the infrastructure needed to deliver agonist or partial agonist treatment. Immunogens will undergo an iterative, integrated series of developmental steps to identify and evaluate the efficacy of candidate MOpVs. Aim 1 will design appropriate haptens and optimize efficacy through the use of a variety of linkers, carrier proteins and adjuvants. Aim 2 will characterize the immunogenicity of individual immunogens and select the most effective for formulation into a single MOpV. Aim 3 will provide rapid-throughput screening of pharmacokinetic and behavioral (hot plate analgesia) efficacy in mice, identify a lead MOpV, and test the hypothesis that immunogens can be combined into a single MOpV without loss of activity. Aim 4 will characterize the effects of MOpV on opiate pharmacokinetics in a second species (rats) over a range of opiate doses and during both acute and repeated drug dosing. Aim 5 will test MOpV efficacy in blocking opiate self-administration in rats, a key behavioral model. Aim 6 will evaluate MOpV safety. These data will provide a comprehensive test of opiate vaccine feasibility, and the novel strategy of using a multivalent vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heroin addiction has profound adverse effects on public health. In addition to disrupting the lives of the addict, family and friends, it is associated with crime, increased health care expenditures, and intravenous drug abuse contributes substantially to the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and other infections. Abuse of prescription opiates has also emerged as a major public health concern, with more use of these opiates currently in the U.S. than heroin, and a substantial number of users becoming addicted. Medication treatments for opiate addiction or abuse are available and effective, but each has real or perceived drawback that result in low acceptability. As a result, the vast majority of opiate addicts or abusers are not receiving medication treatment for this disorder. Alternative medications, which could provide a greater choice of therapeutic options, might increase the number of addicts electing and staying in treatment. Vaccines have been developed for nicotine or cocaine addiction whereby vaccination stimulates the production of antibodies that can bind the addictive drug and reduce the amount that reaches brain. This reduces the drug's rewarding or pleasurable effects. Three nicotine vaccines (for smokers) and one cocaine vaccine are currently in clinical trials as addiction treatments. Initial work in animals suggests that a heroin vaccine could be similarly effective. One challenge in developing an opiate vaccine is that there are many different opiates that can substitute for each other, so that a vaccine would need to block each of these. We propose to develop an opiate vaccine which can block the effects of most of the opiates that are commonly abused. This will be accomplished by taking 3 or more individual vaccines, each of which blocks certain opiates, and combining them into a single  multivalent  vaccine. Our hypothesis is that this approach will provide safe and effective blockade of opiate effects in mice or rats, and provide a vaccine that is suitable for potential clinical development. This could provide an additional type of medication for those opiate addicts or abusers who find the currently available options unacceptable, or possibly for use in addition to existing medications to enhance their efficacy.\",\n",
       " \"Definitive Phase 1B and Phase 2B trials of a candidate blood stage malaria vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1, or AMA-1, in combination with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals' adjuvant AS02A, an immune boosting agent, will be conducted in children in Bandiagara, Mali, West Africa. This project is central to the overall program goal of developing a safe and effective malaria vaccine that prevents disease and death in African infants and children. Blood samples obtained in these clinical trials will be subject to the molecular and immunological analyses described in the Project 2 Research Plan. Thoseanalyses will provide information on strain-specific vs. cross-reactive protection, duration of immune response, and the impact of natural boosting, all of which will inform further vaccine development efforts, including determining which components would be best to include in a multi-component vaccine. A pediatric Phase 1B study in Mali will compare three different doses of AMA-1/AS02A. The malaria vaccine or a comparator vaccine will be injected at 0, 1, and 2 months in a staggered, dose escalating fashion to evaluate safety of the vaccine and its ability to produce an immune response in children. Based on the results of this trial, the best vaccine dose level will be chosen for a Phase 2B study of AMA-1 efficacy. This Phase 2B double blind, controlled trial in children will determine if the malaria vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective at preventing malaria disease and infection. The greatest public health goal for an effective malaria vaccine is to reduce disease and death in children, particularly in Africa. The proposed studies will evaluate the ability of the vaccine to mitigate malaria infection and disease and thus estimate its potential either alone or as a component of a multi-antigen malaria vaccine. If successful, this vaccine may be further developed as a stand-alone vaccine or combined withother protective malaria antigens and/or AMA-1 genotypes. A vaccine that provides protection against both malaria infection and malaria disease will benefit not only African children but also travelers to malaria endemic regions, providing a market to subsidize a vaccine for use in the malaria endemic world.\",\n",

       " 'There is an emerging threat of the use of respiratory pathogens as weapons of bioterrorism. Thus it isimperative that we understand the interaction of viral pathogens with the immune response in the specializedmicroenvironment of the lung. Although a number of pathogens pose a threat, of particular concern is variolavirus. Infection with variola virus results not only in significant morbidity, but in significant fatality.As a result of the eradication of smallpox, the vaccine was discontinued in 1972, leaving those under the ageof 30 unprotected. In addition there is significant concern regarding the length of time protection is sustainedfollowing immunization, such that older individuals are also likely to be susceptible to infection and disease.Surprisingly in spite of the development of an effective vaccine for variola virus, many questions remain inour basic understanding of the interaction of this virus with the host immune response. We have developed amodel for respiratory infection with vaccinia virus, the closely related virus used in the vaccine againstsmallpox. An advantage of the studies in this application is that they focus on the immune response followingintranasal infection, a natural route by which variola virus is obtained and a likely route of inoculation foragents of bioterrorism. The studies in this application build on our published novel observation that the CD8 +T cell response following intranasal infection of mice with a high dose of vaccinia virus is severely decreasedcompared to mice receiving 100-fold less virus. The goal of the studies proposed herein is the identificationof the mechanism(s) responsible for the decreased T cell response. In aim 1 we will determine whether thereduced response following high dose infection is the result of the inefficient activation/expansion of cells orwhether anergy and/or apoptosis is induced in responding CD8 ¿ T cells. In aims 2 and 3 respectively, thecontribution of the antigen presenting cell and the innate/inflammatory response in the lung to the reducedCD8 ¿ T cell response observed following high dose infection will be evaluated. The results from these studieswill provide new and important information on the negative regulation of the immune response followingrespiratory infection and may lead to the development of novel therapeutics that can be used to boost theimmune response following respiratory infection with viruses.',\n",

       " 'The contribution of innate immunity to the early containment of HIV-1 replication remains unknown. We haveinitiated studies to evaluate the role of NK cells in primate lentivirus control in a 10 monkey study in which NKcells have been eliminated from the circulation of animals by infusion of an anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody.In this ongoing study we have demonstrated that elimination of NK cells (CD3-, CD20-, NKG2+ cells) from theperipheral blood of monkeys for 7 days does not effect the kinetics of plasma viral RNA levels or loss ofmemory CD4+ T lymphocytes in the first weeks following an infection with SIVmac251. This observationsuggests that NK cells are playing a negligible role in the early control of SIVmac251 replication.The observation that HIV-1 envelope sequences evolve over time in infected humans to escape from antibodyneutralization suggests that humoral immune responses may be contributing to viral control and, in the process,exerting selection pressure on the virus. We have recently optimized the administration regimen of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to eliminate B lymphocytes for up to a year from the peripheral blood and lymphnodes of rhesus monkeys. We are using this antibody as a tool in an ongoing 20 monkey study to evaluate thecontribution of antibody to early containment of SIVmac251 infection. One hundred days following infection,the anti-CD20 infused monkeys still do not have detectable peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Plasma viral RNAlevels from these animals are still pending. However, we have not observed a significant difference inperipheral blood CD4+ T cell numbers and SIV-gag ELISPOT responses between the monkeys that receivedthe experimental and the control monoclonal antibody infusions, suggesting that viral replication during thisperiod of time is not significantly different in the experimental and control monkeys. We will initiate acomplementing study in May, 2007 to deplete B cells in the setting of SIVmac239 delta nef vaccination andSIVmac251 challenge to assess the contribution of antibody generation to the protection conferred by this liveattenuated vaccine.Although the frequency of HIV-1 superinfection is not known, there is increasing evidence that individualsalready infected with HIV-1 can be infected with a heterologous strain of the virus. This clinical setting mayprovide an important window through which to view the immune and virologic correlates of protection againstHIV-1 infection. The SIV-infected rhesus monkey model provides a powerful system for studying eventsassociated with lentivirus superinfection. This model provides a means of controlling potential variables thatmight impact on transmission, such as the genetic relatedness of the two viruses, the route and timing of virusexposure, and the immune status of the previously infected individual. We have created a model forsuperinfection in monkeys using two SIV isolates that are as disparate in sequence as any two circulating HIV-1isolates. We will also include in these studies cohorts of monkeys that have received received nef-deletedSIVmac239 virus so that the degree of protection afforded by a prior infection with replication-competent viruscan be compared with that provided by a live attenuated virus vaccine.We have initiated studies in this nonhuman primate model of lentivirus superinfection. To differentiate andquantify SIVmac251 and SIVsmE660 in the blood, we have developed a quantitative PCR method fordetermining the RNA levels of the two virus strains in plasma samples. We have established two cohorts ofrhesus monkeys, one infected with SIVmac251 and the other with SIVsmE660. We have defined the baselineimmune function of these monkeys by characterizing their CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte memory subsets andtheir SIV-specific T lymphocyte function by Elispot assay and intracellular cytokine staining. These monkeyswere then exposed to the heterologous virus via 6 weekly intrarectal challenges. Their CD4+ T lymphocytememory subsets, total CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, and plasma viral loads were assessed prospectively. At thecompletion of 6 intrarectal challenges, these animals had no evidence of superinfection as determined byquantitative PCR. We will monitor these animals for an additional four weeks, and if there is no evidence of thesecond virus in their blood, we will expose them to another round of 6 intrarectal challenges. If these monkeysremain protected against superinfection, we will begin studies to determine the mechanism mediating thisprotection. The first of these studies will be to assess the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes in this protection bydepleting these cells through monoclonal antibody infusion and assessing the protection afforded by the priorinfection.It will be essential to define the nature of the transmitted virus to create an effective HIV-1 vaccine. A report byHunter and colleagues suggested that the transmitted virus may have shortened variable loops. To elucidatewhether deletions in the variable loops of Env reflect a transmission bottleneck, we are examining viralsequence evolution in a cohort of 5 rhesus monkeys that were infected with a genetically-defined stock ofSIVmac251 via repeated intrarectal inoculation. At the time of peak viral replication and up to 6 months afterinfection, we did not observe variable loop deletions in the env gene. Interestingly, as these monkeys progressedfrom acute to chronic infection at 16 months after infection, selection occurred for viruses with deletions in thevariable loops VI and V4 in all five animals. The data suggest that these variants evolved as a result ofphenotypic selection. To evaluate the biological properties of these variants which have been selected for in thehost, we will evaluate whether these viral variants emerged as a result of viral escape from neutralizationantibodies, change in receptor usage, or variable viral fitness.We also have a study ongoing in rhesus monkeys to evaluate the quasi-speciation of SIVmac251 following theinitiation of infection to determine whether there are particular selection pressures in mucosal compartmentsthat shape the transmitted virus. In a pilot study of 4 rhesus monkeys, we are evaluating virus evolution inmucosal and systemic anatomic compartments to determine whether a local immunologic milieu has an impacton the nature of the mutational changes that the virus accumulates over time. Preliminary data indicate thatCTL pressure may be greater on seminal virus than on circulating virus in the first weeks following infection.Although chimeric viruses that express an HIV-1 envelope on an SIV backbone hold promise for facilitating theelucidation of important envelope-associated events in HIV-1 infection and early pathogenesis, the R5-tropicSHIVs that have been generated to date do not cause sufficiently consistent pathogenic consequences to beuseful for such studies. To address the need for a consistently pathogenic R5-tropic SHIV, we have constructedSHIV-KB9 viruses that express the V3 loop of two R5-tropic HIV-1 isolates, ADA and YU2. These virusesdemonstrate an in vitro tropism for CD4+ T cells that express the CCR5 co-receptor, suggesting that alteredtropism of SHFV-KB9 can be achieved by substitution of the gp!20 V3 loop. In a pilot study of the in vivopathogenic properties of these newly constructed R5-tropic SHIVs, both chimeric constructs replicated to highlevels during the period of primary infection and caused a dramatic loss of memory CD4+ T lymphocytes. Themost consistently pathogenic of these viruses will be chosen for further development. A cell-free stock will beprepared and titered in vivo for rectal challenge studies to evaluate novel vaccine candidates in monkeys. Thischimeric virus will also serve as a backbone for creating a construct to evaluate the pathogenic ramifications ofthe newly defined signature sequences associated with transmitted HIV-1.Building on previous descriptions of human, mouse, and cynomologous monkey B cell subsets, antibody panelswere developed to detect activation, maturation, and function-associated molecules on peripheral blood B cellsof rhesus monkeys. To establish baseline data on B cell subsets, peripheral blood from 20 naive rhesus monkeyswas evaluated. We then applied these B cell panels to the study of peripheral blood of SlV-infected animals 56days and 2 years after infection. While the overall number of B cells did not differ significantly differentbetween naive and infected animals, we found clear evidence of pathogenic subset changes, including a loss ofnaive B cells and an increase in number of activated, memory-type B cells. We are currently extending thesestudies to include an evaluation lymphatic tissue, including lymph nodes and gastrointestinal tissue, as well asan application of antibodies that detect plasma cell subsets.',\n",
       " 'AbstractThe objectives of this project are first, to increase the efficacy and safety of live poxvirus vaccines against smallpox and other virulent poxviruses, and second, to increase the efficacy of live vaccinia virus vaccines as a vaccine platform for protection against multiple agents important in the fields of biodefense and emerging infections.The specific aims of this project are as follows:1. To identify key mechanisms of viral induction of immune responses, particularly those contributing to the efficacy of vaccinia virus MVA vaccines:The goal is to learn how to maximize the induction of protective responses through the manipulation of viral control of these processes.2. To determine if different orthopoxviruses, specifically vaccinia virus MVA, vaccinia virus (WR), and cowpox virus differentially affect dendritic cell (DC) responses to viral infection.  The goal is to determine the mechanisms contributing to species-specific effects upon DC functions. We will  use this information to manipulate viral control of DC responses to infection in order to maximize protective responses induced by vaccine viruses.3. To determine if the efficacies of MVA vaccines can be improved by modification of accessory proteins encoded by the vaccine virus.The goal is to determine if the stability, delivery regimen, and the efficacy of vaccinia virus MVA vaccines can be improved by the expression of two cowpox/vaccinia virus accessory genes that encode proteins enabling the MVA virus vaccine to embed its intracellular mature virus (IMV) within A-type inclusion particles.The current MVA virus vaccine provides a safe alternative to the currently licensed smallpox vaccines that are associated with a significant degree of adverse effects. However, because of the MVA virus is defective for replication in human cells, large doses of MVA are needed, and multiple doses may be needed for effective protection against specific agents. Therefore, methods to enhance the stability and delivery of thisvaccine, as well as methods to enhance the immunogenicity of this vaccine virus, preferably to the point of reducing the vaccination to a single dose, would significantly enhance the efficacy of this vaccine vector.',\n",
       " 'Transmission of HIV-1, development of persistent infection, and establishment of the prognostically-important plasma viral load setpoint, are the three critical events that sustain the HIV-1 pandemic and lead to the clinical sequelae of AIDS. A vaccine that favorably impacts any one of these key events could have a major impact on the HIV/AIDS pandemic; a practically achievable vaccine in the near term might impact all three, whereas an ideal vaccine wouldinduce sterilizing immunity. Thus, we would propose that rational HIV-1 vaccine development requires an in-depth understanding of viral and host determinants of HIV-1 transmission, persistence, and partial containment in primary human infection. This should reveal critical viral vulnerabilities as well as host immune defense mechanisms amenable to vaccine-elicited augmentation. The Principal Investigator has thus developed a research plan that targets fouressential aspects of viral-host interaction in acute and early infection in order to test the following overall hypothesis: HIV-1 leads to chronic persistent infection rather than acutely lethal disease because elements of the adaptive immune system partially constrain viral replication beginning in the earliest stages of primary infection. The goal of this project is not only to test rigorously this overarching hypothesis, but then to dissect and elucidate those viral and hostfactors that mediate this effect. Aim 1. To elucidate the genetic, biologic, antigenic, and structural characteristics of sexually transmitted virus and mechanisms underlying virus transmission.Aim 2. To elucidate the ontogeny of HIV-1 specific T cell, natural killer (NK) cell, and dendritic cell (DC) responses in acute and early HIV-1 Infection. Aim 3. To elucidate the ontogeny of HIV-1 specific B cell responses in acute and early HIV-1 infection. Aim 4. To elucidate host genetic differences affecting susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression in acute and early HIV-1 infection. Thus, each R01 aim addresses important scientific gaps in our understanding of early viral, immunologic, and host genetic influences on primary HIV-1 infection, thus providing critical information to drive HIV-1 vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective is the commercialization of a safe, effective, easy to use and painless polynucleotide vaccine delivery system that can be used in vaccines for biodefense against NIAID Category A, B and C pathogens. In addition to biodefense related vaccines, the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system which is the subject of this commercialization project can be used in other infectious disease and cancer vaccines. The specific vaccine being developed for delivery by the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system is a dengue vaccine. Dengue is a virus specifically mentioned in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research. The polynucleotide vaccine delivery system called Easy Vax, uses a microneedle array coated with the vaccine directly on the needles of the array. There are hundreds of needles, each less than 0.5 mm long. The array is inserted into skin using a device that contains an insertion mechanism and electronics. The needles penetrate at least to the basal lamina of skin, adjacent to target cells such as skin Langerhans cells and epithelial cells. After insertion, the vaccine polynucleotide leaves the needles and is available for delivery into cells. Brief electrical pulses, delivered by the self-contained electronics deliver the vaccine polynucleotide into cells. Once in cells, vaccine antigen is expressed and stimulates both humoral and cell mediated immunity. A dengue DNA vaccine is being developed for delivery by the Easy Vax vaccine delivery system. All work to date was done using dengue 1. Since there are four dengue serotypes and all need to be included in a commercial vaccine, vaccine plasmids need to be made for the remaining three serotypes. Dengue is a major public health problem in many tropical areas. Specific aims of this project are to produce a pilot production line for manufacture of the microneedle arrays, molecularly engineer the remaining three vaccine plasmids, test the tetravalent vaccine in mice and primates, safety test the vaccine and assess acceptance of the delivery system by humans.',\n",

Rather, the vast majority of primary infections in those with a fully functional immune system are asymptomatic.  In contrast, CMV infection in those without a functional immune system is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.    This includes CMV infections in those coinfected with HIV.  Therefore, CMV vaccine strategies developed through these two grants will have direct clinical relevance to protecting those most at risk for CMV disease, including HIV AIDS patients.Since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first recognized as a threat to the developing fetus, there have been repeated calls for a vaccine that could protect from the damaging effects of HCMV infection in those at risk for HCMV disease. The long quest for a HCMV vaccine that could prevent congenital infection and fetal sequelae, as well as end- organ disease in immune compromised individuals, remains unfulfilled. The primary objective measure for evaluating the efficiency of any vaccine is whether protective levels of immunity are generated and sustained in the vaccinees. An important issue for HCMV is the definition of what constitutes protective immunity. Using a stringent threshold, an immune response can be considered protective only if the vaccinees are absolutely protected from infection following repeated exposure to virus. Alternatively, a vaccine could still be considered protective if the course of challenge virus infection was so dramatically altered that the potential for transmission (horizontal and vertical) and pathogenesis of challenge virus was essentially eliminated. The difference between the two involves the level of virus replication at the primary site of challenge and the extent of dissemination beyond. The former definition requires the generation and maintenance of sterilizing immunity with no spread of the virus. The latter does not, but it does require that the immune system maintain a lifelong restriction on replication of a virus with a complex natural history of persistence in immune competent hosts. The hypothesis is presented that immunization against CMV can generate protective immune responses, although the degree of protection (sterilizing versus limited dissemination) will be dependent on both the titer of challenge virus and the frequency of exposure. According to this hypothesis, immunization can protect completely against infrequent exposure to a low titer CMV challenge. Protection will become more variable as the titer and/or the frequency of exposure to challenge virus increases. Vaccination should shift the virus-host balance decidedly in favor of the host such that both reactivation and shedding are significantly diminished. The hypothesis will be tested in the rhesus macaque model of HCMV infection through the following Aims. (I) Genetic immunization of seronegative macaques with plasmid expression vectors for RhCMV gB, pp65, and IE1, followed by immunization with formalin-inactivated virus. (II) Subcutaneous challenge of vaccinees and controls by experimental inoculation with either high or low titers of RhCMV. (III) Immunization of macaques followed by challenge of vaccinees and controls by natural routes with natural titers of RhCMV by co-housing vaccinees with seropositive, virus-excreting macaques. (IV) Alterations of RhCMV gene expression patterns to induce novel protective immune responses. A CMV vaccine can be considered protective if it results in a dead-end infection. This proposal will stringently test whether a combination of genetic immunization and formalin-inactivated virus can effectively eliminate horizontal spread of RhCMV following either experimental or natural infection.',\n",

A group of HIV-uninfected children with perinatal exposure to HIV from a similar sociodemographic background and age distribution will be enrolled for comparison.Domains to be investigated include growth and sexual maturation, metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cardiac function, bone health, neurologic, neurodevelopment, language, hearing and behavioral function, and human papillomavirus(HPV); infection.I.\\t   HYPOTHESIS The impact of HIV infection and its treatment on the growth and development of children who have been living with HIV infection since birth is not fully known. The PHACS AMP protocol is designed to study the effect of HIV infection on key processes of maturation such as pubertal development, bone growth, fat distribution, and hepatic, renal and cardiovascular functions. In addition, behavior in adolescents plays a major role in adherence to medications, treatment failure, evolution of viral resistance, and secondary transmission of HIV, including the transmission of resistant virus, to others. This knowledge can form the basis for interventions to improve the quality of life of infected children. Unfortunately, the number of HIV-infected infants, children and adolescents worldwide is growing substantially in both resource-poor countries and in countries with increasing levels of health care. Thus the information gained from this study will benefit the increasing number of infected youth worldwide.II.\\tSPECIFIC AIMSTo define the impact of HIV infection and ART on growth and pubertal development (and their hormonal regulation), along with the cognitive, academic, and social development, of pre-adolescents and adolescents with perinatal HIV infection as they move through adolescence into adulthood.To identify infectious and non-infectious complications of HIV disease and evaluate their associations with ART. These include toxicities resulting from ART, including mitochondrial toxicity, lipid abnormalities, and end-organ damage.To investigate:Changes in glucose metabolism, body composition, and bone mineralization;Changes in lipid metabolism and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease;Cognitive and behavioral changes over time, including medication adherence, family and social function, and high risk behaviors such as risky sexual behavior, licit drug abuse, illicit drug use, tobacco and alcohol use; Risk factors for secondary transmission of HIV; andThe occurrence and clinical course of cervical HPV infections among females.DOMAIN-SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESESGrowth and Sexual MaturationSpecific AimTo longitudinally track height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and sexual maturation in perinatally exposed HIV-infected and uninfected children and to correlate measurements with parental stature (if available), lifestyle (diet and physical exercise)and disease and treatment status.Hypothesis:Perinatally HIV-infected children who reach adolescence manifest reduced growth, and delayed onset and altered trajectory of sexual maturation compared to HIV-exposed but uninfected children of similar socioedemographic background.Metabolic Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease Specific AimTo characterize the emergence and estimate the occurrence of insulin resistance and abnormal glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and abnormal body composition and their relationship to HIV disease status and specific ART regimens in HIV-infected children over time. HypothesesCompared to non-infected children, there will be an increase in central adiposity or peripheral fat wasting prior to additional morbidity associated with lipodystrophy. The onset of puberty will be associated with progression of these changes. Specific ART regimens and classes of ART agents will have different effects on these metabolic and anthropometric outcomes.Subjects with insulin resistance will have a high likelihood of abnormal glucose tolerance and increased total body and trunk fat. Subjects with abnormal lipid levels will also have the greatest percentages of total and trunk fat and will have elevated vascular inflammatory markers. Together these factors have the potential to contribute to early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Cardiac FunctionSpecific AimTo estimate the prevalence of cardiac structural and functional abnormalities in HIV-infected and uninfected children and youth with perinatal HIV exposure.HypothesesThe prevalence of cardiac myocardial dysfunction is increased in children with perinatal HIV infection and is related to both HIV infection and ART.The magnitude of the abnormal physiologic indices of cardiac structure and function is positively correlated with both the intensity and duration of ART exposure.An association exists between abnormal CV structure and function and mtDNA mutations and suggests that mitochondrial abnormalities may lead to impaired CV functioning.Bone Mineral DensitySpecific AimsTo estimate the differences in BMD of HIV-infected children when compared to HIV-exposed but uninfected children and normal healthy children from a pre-existing research database. To identify virologic, immunologic, therapeutic, hormonal, nutritional, and environmental factors associated with abnormal bone mineralization in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, -uninfected children.HypothesesBMD of HIV-infected children, after adjusting for growth and pubertal status, will be significantly lower than HIV-exposed, -uninfected children and HIV-unexposed children of the same sex and age.For HIV-infected children, significant factors adversely affecting normal BMD will include delayed puberty, advanced HIV disease, and exposure to tenofovir or protease inhibitors. Factors associated with better BMD will include higher BMI, African-American race, and exposure to nevirapine or other NNRTIs.Subjects with BMD z-score, corrected for bone age will have evidence of increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Levels of calcium and vitamin D will not be related to a lower BMD.Neurologic, Neurodevelopment, Language, Hearing, and Behavioral FunctionSpecific AimsTo examine occurrence and patterns of change of the following cognitive and behavioral outcomes among HIV-infected and HIV-exposed but uninfected children: Emotional and behavioral health problems; High risk behaviors including risky sexual behavior, licit drug abuse, illicit drug use, and tobacco and alcohol use; Neurodevelopmental impairment including cognitive function, academic achievement, executive function, adaptive functioning, hearing, and language development ; andAdherence to antiretroviral therapy among infected subjects. To examine the association between HIV infection status and the rates and types of behavioral outcomes specified above (except non-adherence) by comparing perinatally HIV-infected youth to HIV-exposed but uninfected youth from similar backgrounds.To examine rates of non-adherence to ART and the predictors of non-adherence among HIV-infected subjects, including youth factors;e.g., age, sex, mental health, sexual risk behavior, substance use, and neurodevelopment(caregiver factors;e.g., mental health, substance use, education, and cognitive function), and other sociodemographic factors. To examine the association between family and psychosocial factors;e.g., caregiver cognitive function, caregiver health, caregiver substance use and mental health, stressful life events, and caregiver-child relationships; and emotional and behavioral problems in the child.HypothesesBehavioral outcomes among HIV-exposed but uninfected children are better than those of children with perinatal HIV infection.There will be high rates of health risk behaviors among perinatally HIV-infected youth that increase with age and that are associated with each other (e.g., sexual and drug risk behaviors and non-adherence to treatment).Family and psychosocial factors (e.g., caregiver cognitive function, caregiver health, caregiver substance use and mental health, stressful life events, and caregiver-child relationships)and child factors (e.g., cognitive status, behavioral problems, and age are associated with adherence.Adolescent Gynecology and HPV InfectionSpecific AimsIn perinatally HIV-infected and HIV-exposed but uninfected females who are having gynecologic exams performed as standard of care:To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for developing cervical LSIL and HSIL as determined by cytology and histology; andTo estimate the rate of regression of LSIL.HypothesesThe risk of developing LSIL and HSIL is higher in HIV-infected youth than that reported for HIV-uninfected youth. Risk factors for LSIL and HSIL will include low CD4+ T-cell counts, smoking, substance use, and oral contraceptive use.LSIL is less likely to regress among perinatally HIV-infected youth than among HIV-uninfected youth. Risk factors for HPV persistence will include smoking, immunosuppression, and oral contraceptive use. Infection at multiple sites reflects global immune failure at mucosal sites reflected by a lower rate or regression. III.\\tBACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Impact of HIV Infection on Pre-adolescents and AdolescentsThe advances in treatment to prevent maternal HIV transmission to neonates have been groundbreaking. As a result, the number of new perinatally-infected children in the U.S. is now small. Subsequent improvements in the treatment of HIV-infected infants and children have been equally remarkable, ensuring that most previously infected American children have survived and are approaching adolescence. It is estimated that there are about 10,000 HIV-infected children and perinatally HIV-infected adolescents currently living with HIV in the U.S. with 15% between 6 and 10 years of age and 50% between 11 and 16 years of age. In the CDC Pediatric Spectrum of HIV Disease study, the median age of HIV-infected children is 11 years. In addition, the number of HIV-infected adolescents worldwide is growing substantially in both resource-poor countries and in countries with increasing levels of health care. Therefore, there is a global cohort of children who have been living with HIV infection since birth who are aging into adolescence. Little is definitively known about the impact of HIV infection and its treatment on the maturation process in these children. Growth, Maturation, and Body Composition in Pre-adolescents and AdolescentsGrowth failure is a frequent manifestation of untreated pediatric HIV infection which can be improved by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although frank growth hormone (GH) deficiency is not commonly diagnosed in HIV-infected children, it has been suggested that the observed growth failure may be due, at least in part, to resistance to GH and/or to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), the physiological mediator of the growth-promoting action of GH. A limited number of studies of GH treatment of short children with HIV infection have been reported. High-dose GH, thought to be necessary to overcome endogenous GH resistance, has been shown to ameliorate HIV wasting after 12 weeks of administration to infected adults. In addition to the impact of GH on growth, it is speculated that resistance to GH may contribute to immunodeficiency in HIV infection so that exogenous high-dose GH treatment could be a useful adjunctive therapy to aid immune reconstitution. An additional effect of HIV infection that has been observed in perinatally-infected children and in transfusion-infected hemophiliacs is delayed sexual maturation. In addition to changes in growth and maturation, highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)causes a metabolic syndrome well-characterized in adults as unfavorable body composition (reduction in subcutaneous and increase in visceral fat), insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. The physiologic effect of the metabolic syndrome places patients at risk for cardiovascular (CV)disorders. There is controversy whether the metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected patients is exclusively related to ART exposure; other causes may include HIV itself (because many of the features of the metabolic syndrome pre-date HAART), underlying family risk factors, or a combination of all of these. Studies in children show similar although not identical findings, including abnormal body composition, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, with increased risk at older age and longer duration of HAART. The onset of puberty has been proposed as another factor causing these changes. In adults with HAART-induced metabolic syndrome, growth hormone treatment at pharmacological doses has resulted in significant and sustained improvements in both lean body mass and fat compartments, although data on long-term outcomes are lacking.Most previous studies of growth, puberty, and body composition in HIV-infected children have either been done in small numbers of subjects, in mixed cohorts of vertically and horizontally acquired disease, or analyzed in a cross-sectional as opposed to a longitudinal manner. In addition, a well-matched comparison group is often lacking and a mechanistic component is usually not included. The power of the current proposal is that it allows for longitudinal study of a large, homogeneous population of perinatally HIV-infected children of pubertal age for study of relationships between disease status (e.g., immune deficiency&), ART, and growth, puberty, and body composition. The results could lead to alterations of existing viral-specific therapeutic protocols, as well as to consideration of adjunctive treatments (e.g., human GH) to augment growth, improve immune function, and to counteract abnormal body composition and risk of metabolic syndrome.Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Pre-adolescents and AdolescentsSeveral studies have investigated the relationship between HAART and atherosclerosis. In a report of 102 HIV-infected subjects, a higher prevalence of carotid artery lesions was detected in patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy than among those receiving PI-sparing regimens or no therapy. A large cohort study of 17,852 patients showed that adverse CV risk factors are associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)and PI use. Several studies have documented a 4 to 7 fold increase in annual incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) among HIV-infected patients after the introduction of HAART, when compared to the pre-HAART era. In a systematic review of the literature, Rhew et al. found that the majority of published studies showed that PI use is associated with lipid abnormalities and morphologic signs of CV disease. These data suggest that exposure to PI therapy is an important risk factor for developing a MI. As HIV-infected children and youth live longer and have longer exposure to HAART, premature CV disease becomes an increasing concern. One of the most significant mechanisms of atherosclerotic heart disease is vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced flow mediated dilation. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is greater in HIV-infected children and adults when compared to controls, independent of known CV risk factors. Activation and/or injury of the endothelium can play a role in the development of vascular complications. Raised plasma levels of endothelial markers such as von Willebrand factor(vWF)antigen, soluble thrombomodulin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 have a prognostic and/or diagnostic value. Cell adhesion proteins such as the selectins may be elevated as well.  HIV-infected patients have conditions that may contribute to the activation or injury of the endothelium including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Although HIV-infected children clearly demonstrate the features of lipodystrophy, very few investigations have focused on early CV risk in these children. In this study, we will describe the prevalence and risk factors associated with fat redistribution in HIV-infected children. Cardiac FunctionAbnormalities in left ventricular (LV) structure and function occur in HIV-infected children and are some of the strongest predictors of subsequent mortality. These abnormalities are likely to result from multiple causes including infection of the myocardial cells with HIV, coinfection with cardiotropic viruses, autonomic dysfunction, and cardiotoxicity resulting from pharmacologic agents and inflammatory cytokins. The abnormalities of LV structure and function associated with HIV cardiomyopathy can be related to depressed contractility from HIV, LV dilation, increased afterload (abnormal LV dimension:wall thickness), and abnormalities of heart rate and blood pressure. Similar abnormalities of LV structure and function are observed with ART that lead to cardiomyopathy in adults and animal models.Children and young adolescents offer a unique opportunity to study the physiologic mechanisms of specific types of cardiomyopathy, as they are less likely than older adolescents and adults to be affected by such confounding factors as hypertension, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus and coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, the need for future growth and longer survival in children suggest that subclinical abnormalities of cardiac structure and function may be more likely to result in subsequent symptomatic cardiomyopathy in children than in adults.Cardiac dysfunction also occurs in HIV-exposed but -uninfected children. The fact that LV dysfunction is found in both HIV-infected and -uninfected children born to HIV-infected women suggest that the dysfunction is related in part to the intrauterine environment. One of the environmental factors may be in utero ART exposure. The effects of ART on the cardiovascular system of HIV-infected children are poorly understood. This is an important area of investigation for two reasons. First, HIV-infected children are routinely exposed to ART therapy for many years even as their cardiovascular system is developing and as HIV infection is affecting their overall development. The potential for ART to cause damage to the cardiovascular system is magnified by both the duration of exposure and its occurrence during critical stages in a child's cardiovascular development. Second, the effects of ART and HIV on the cardiovascular system status of children may interact, given that both act on the cardiovascular system and on each other. Yet, the direction and magnitude of the effects of ART and HIV in combination are unknown.This study will include an assessment of N-terminal plasma N (amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (proBNP) as a marker of myocardial dysfunction. ProBNP is a useful biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ventricular dysfunction, heart failure and coronary syndromes in adults, and also is a strong predictive marker for future cardiovascular events in adults and children. Age-related changes in proBNP have been observed. The proBNP will be compared to the echocardiographic assessment of LV structure and function. We have found echocardiogram parameters of LV structure and function to be very sensitive for detecting asymptomatic cardiomyopathies in children with mitochondrial toxicity, a proposed mechanism of ART-associated cardiotoxicity.In addition to studies of structure and function of the heart, studies are currently underway among ART-exposed children born to HIV-infected women to see if there is a link between LV dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations which are not present in controls. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis screening of umbilical cord tissue from infants exposed in utero to zidovudine (ZDV); and lamivudine (3TC) (n greater than or equal to 10) demonstrated a significant 3.7-fold increase in mtDNA mutations/sequence variants compared with unexposed controls (n greater than or equal to 9) (P less than 0.001). Each ZDV-3TC exposed infant had eight additional sets of distinct mutations not found in controls. These data suggest hotspots for drug-induced mtDNA mutations. Similar frequently occurring mtDNA mutations are observed in cord blood lymphocytes of infants exposed prepartum to ZDV-3TC, and in umbilical cords of newborns exposed in utero to ZDV as the only NRTI (40; V. Walker, personal communication, 2006). Thus, exposure to ART in utero may result in permanent changes in mitochondrial function that could have long-term adverse implications. Therefore, the association between in utero ART exposure, mtDNA mutations, and clinical cardiovascular abnormalities is an important area for further study.Bone Mineralization in Pre-adolescents and AdolescentsHIV-infected children have lower bone mineral density (BMD)than healthy age-, sex- and race-matched controls. Yet very few of the HIV-infected children have had longitudinal follow-up of their BMD. During childhood and adolescence, bone mass increases extensively through longitudinal growth and changes in skeletal size and shape. By 18 years of age, as much as 90% of peak bone mass has been attained, and, by the end of the third decade of life, the acquisition of peak bone mass is complete. Several factors influence the peak bone mass attained, including sex, ethnicity, genetics, weight-bearing physical activity, dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D, and pubertal development through hormonal influences. Various risk factors for low BMD in HIV-infected children have been identified but no consistent pattern has emerged. These include low CD4+ T-cell count, use of HAART, and lipodystrophy. Tenofovir has been associated with a reduction in BMD in children. HIV-infected children receiving HAART and those with calcium insufficiency also showed higher levels of bone resorption markers. Some of these risk factors for low BMD in HIV-infected children are consistent with those identified among HIV-infected adults; these include high lactate levels, specific HAART regimens, CD4+ T-cell count, visceral fat deposition, and glucose intolerance. Indicators of decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption have also been observed. In addition, known risk factors for low BMD in the general population have been found in HIV-infected adults, including smoking, weight loss, low lean body mass, illicit drug and medication use, and perturbations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Many gaps remain in our understanding of low BMD in children and youth with perinatal HIV disease.Pre-Adolescent and Adolescent BehaviorWith the advent of ART, perinatally-infected children are reaching older childhood and adolescence in larger numbers. These youth are primarily of ethnic minority status living in low socioeconomic status urban communities and have many barriers to optimizing their mental and behavioral health. Their problems are not only detrimental to themselves, but may place others at risk for HIV. Furthermore, there are many confounding factors related to the HIV infection, such as progression of HIV disease, neurocognitive deficits due to HIV, HIV stigma, and disclosure of infection status, which when combined with environmental factors such as substance use, poverty, inner-city stress, and disrupted family attachments due to substance use and illness, make adolescence a challenging period for these HIV-infected youth. Pre-adolescents and adolescents with HIV face additional unique complexities related to the impact of HIV on health, mental health, and normative developmental process such as school functioning, puberty, growth, peer relationships and sexuality. As these youth reach adolescence, suboptimal adherence to complex medication regimens also becomes a prominent issue which can lead to viral resistance and treatment failure. Additionally, adolescence is a time of increased experimentation with sexual behavior and drug use which provides opportunities for transmission of HIV to others. Studies of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents show high rates of: psychiatric disorders including mood, anxiety, and behavioral problems, high risk sexual behaviors and substance use, and non-adherence to ART. The literature from studies of other populations of inner-city adolescents suggests that these youths are at high risk for poor outcomes through young adulthood, including difficulties functioning independently, engaging in risk behaviors, and developing multi-drug resistance to ART.In most U.S. urban centers where pediatric HIV is most prevalent, pediatric AIDS represents a confluence of two major urban epidemics: HIV disease and substance abuse in the context of poverty. Early drug use exacerbates the problem of early sexual behavior through disinhibition and is associated with high rates of unprotected intercourse, teen pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). HIV-infected youth may be at even greater risk for contracting STIs due to their compromised immune functioning, and the presence of STIs, in turn, increases the chances of transmitting the virus to partners. Thus, adolescence is a particularly vulnerable stage of development with profound physical, behavioral, and emotional consequences. Furthermore, youth entering adolescence with the burden of HIV infection have endured perinatal deficits in growth, maturation, and neurodevelopment as well as years of less than optimal therapy and the psychosocial ramifications of HIV disease. Therefore, understanding the behavioral dimensions of the youth is critical to understanding their outcomes and identifying potential points of intervention. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) study will follow a large number of youth, with and without HIV infection, from the pre-adolescent era through completion of adolescence to evaluate the effect of HIV infection and the multiple confounding issues on their health and mental health outcomes. Complications of HPV Infection in HIV-Infected Children and YouthAmong the STIs confronting sexually active adolescents, human papillomavirus (HPV) is perhaps the most important. HPV is a well-established cause of significant morbidity and is necessary for the development of invasive genital cancers including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and anal cancers. Other factors associated with cervical cancer development include smoking cigarettes and prolonged oral contraceptive use (greater than 6 years). Certainly, nicotine and its metabolites can be detected directly from cervical mucous. Hence smoking may have direct carcinogenic effects or may alter immunologic responses in cervical mucous. Progesterone levels have also been associated with abnormal cell proliferation. Substance use has been shown to be associated with immune depression and may accelerate progression of HPV. HPV is quite common in healthy adolescents and young women with up to 50% acquiring HPV within a few years after initiating intercourse. Fortunately, the majority of infections in this age group are transient and benign.  However, in HIV-infected adolescents and adults, HIV infection is associated with persistence of HPV. This is not unexpected since HPV persistence has been linked to disordered cell mediated immune responses. A recent study of adolescents and young women from the REACH cohort showed that persistence of cervical HPV and the development of high grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSIL)were extremely common. Approximately 45% of the adolescent women demonstrated HPV persistence, particularly with HPV type 16, the most common type seen in invasive cancers. This persistence paralleled progression of HPV infection to significant precancerous lesions. In this same cohort, the incidence of HSIL was higher for HIV infected than uninfected (21.5% vs. 4.8% incidence by end of follow-up). This finding was even more dramatic for HIV-infected adolescents with baseline or early low grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL) where 31% progressed to HSIL. In the final multivariate analysis, hormonal contraceptive use, high interleukin-12 (IL-12) concentrations of the cervical mucous, and persistent LSIL prior to HSIL were significantly associated with the development of HSIL. These factors were found to be independent of CD4+ T-cell counts. The high IL-12 concentrations in cervical mucous associated with HSIL may be suggestive of a local immune dysregulation to HPV caused in part by HIV infection. The role of hormonal contraception as a risk factor deserves further investigation given the proposed relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and cervical cancer and the need for adequate but safe birth control in HIV-infected girls. The data regarding ART and HPV control is complicated. It appears that control of HIV replication and improved CD4+ T-cell counts resulting from ART may lower the risk of developing HSIL. However, once HSIL develops, ART does not appear to strongly influence its natural history. Unfortunately, little is known about the natural history of HPV in adolescents with perinatal HIV infection, limiting our ability to adequately care for this group.The REACH study included only adolescents with behavioral acquisition of HIV who had been HIV-infected for a relatively short period of time. Most were not receiving ART. This study allows for HPV to be studied in the context of long-term perinatal HIV infection and ART.\",\n",

As the majority of children with perinatally acquired HIV infection have aged into adolescence, and the majority of new pediatric HIV infections in the US are occurring in the adolescent age group, the new age-based recommendations for meningococcal immunization patients will lead to most HIV-infected youth being age-eligible for a vaccine for which there are no safety or immunogenicity data available from HIV-infected populations.

This immune dysfunction may increase the risk of invasive meningococcal disease in HIV-infected patients as well, but few cases have been reported. In a case-control study during a meningococcal A outbreak in Uganda, the prevalence of HIV infection was no more common among meningococcal cases than a cohort of pregnant women selected as controls.  In a retrospective cohort study of a population of 2900 HIV-infected patients followed over 10 years in London , only two cases of invasive meningococcal disease were identified, but this annualized rate of 6.9/100,000 was substantially higher than population-based studies of meningococcal disease in similar areas.  In a population-based study of invasive meningococcal disease in Atlanta, Georgia, there was, as expected, a higher annual rate of disease among 18-24 years old (1.17 per 100,000) compared to that of all adults (0.5 per 100,000), but the estimated annual rate among HIV-infected adults was substantially higher (11.2 per 100,000).  These data are suggestive but not definitive of an increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease in HIV-infected populations.Meningococcal conjugate vaccineThe tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (MCV4) is a meningococcal polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine. The vaccine contains Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, Y, and W-135 capsular polysaccharide antigens individually conjugated to diphtheria toxoid protein. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. The four meningococcal components, present as individual serogroup-specific glycoconjugates, compose the final formulated vaccine. No preservative or adjuvant is added during the manufacturing process. The vaccine is manufactured as a sterile, clear to slightly turbid liquid. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine is formulated in sodium phosphate buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution to contain 4 ¿g each of meningococcal A, C, Y, and W-135 polysaccharides conjugated to approximately 48 ¿g of diphtheria toxoid protein carrier. MCV4 is available only in single-dose vials. The vaccine was approved by the FDA on January 18, 2005. The meningococcal work group of the ACIP has made a recommendation that adolescents 11-12 years of age receive the vaccine at their preadolescent physician visit. ACIP's final recommendations also included vaccination of adolescents at approximately 15 years of age (high-school entry), and incoming college freshmen living in dormitories. By 2008, ACIP's goal will be routine vaccination with MCV4 of all adolescents beginning at age 11 years. Correlates of protection against invasive meningococcal diseaseWhile the reference standard for evidence of protection against invasive meningococcal disease caused by serogroup C was demonstration of titers =4 using a serum bactericidal antibody assay in which human sera are used as the exogenous complement source (hSBA), limited availability of human sera for the assay has led to substitution of baby rabbit sera as the exogenous complement source (rSBA).  rSBA is considered the standard correlate of clinical protection against serogroup C meningococcal disease by the World Health Organization, and rSBA titers of < 8 have been proposed to be predictive of susceptibility to invasive meningococcal disease.  rSBA titers =1:128 have been found to be highly predictive of protection, but the range of 1:8-1:64 were equivocal.  Based on additional analyses,  rSBA titers of = 8 have been proposed to correlate with short-term protection.  During an outbreak of serogroup C infection in a university setting, for instance, all infected students had rSBA titers of <4. A fourfold rise in rSBA titers pre- to post-vaccination has been proposed as a correlate of protection, particularly for those cases in which rSBA titer falls in the equivocal range of 1:8-1:64.  This four-fold rise in rSBA was the principal immunogenicity outcome measure used for the trial of MCV4 in healthy 11-18 year olds, used as the basis for licensure of MCV4 in the US for this age group [see below].  No direct efficacy measures of this vaccine were used for the basis of licensure.   Monovalent (serogroup C) meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MenC) were first licensed in the United Kingdom on the basis of their ability to induce serum bactericidal activity as a correlate of efficacy without explicit efficacy data. A reduction in the incidence of bacterial meningitis caused by serogroup C was observed in the United Kingdom after immunization campaigns with MenC were introduced. Based on these data, we would propose using 4-fold rise in rSBA titers to serogroup C as the primary measure upon which sample size for studying immunogenicity should be calculated.\",\n",

The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.Background:  Influenza, a highly communicable acute respiratory disease, is one of the major infectious disease threats to the human population. Influenza virus affects individuals of all ages, causes repeated infections throughout life, and is responsible for annual worldwide epidemics of varying severity.  In average years there are an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 0.5 million deaths per year worldwide. There are an estimated 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalization caused by influenza every year in the US.  Pandemic influenza viruses spread rapidly and cause high levels of disease and death globally. Some of the challenges in developing an effective vaccine for influenza occur because influenza viruses exhibit change in genetic structure each season.  None of the current vaccines offer protection in a way that accounts for this genetic change.  Other challenges to the development of influenza vaccine occur because of the current technique available for manufacturing this vaccine. Currently the vaccines that are available are made in eggs, which limit the number of doses and also cause lengthy delays in vaccine production.  VaxInnate has developed a cross-protective influenza A vaccine, VAX102, which is based on a recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. Unlike the HA and NA viral proteins, the 24 amino acid sequence of M2e has remained remarkably stable in all human influenza A virus isolates since the influenza pandemic of 1918.  Thus an influenza vaccine based on the M2e antigen could elicit broad, cross-protective immunity against most human influenza A virus strains.  Because the VAX102 vaccine relies on a single cross-reactive influenza A virus antigen manufactured by a recombinant protein fermentation-production process that does not involve eggs, stock-piling of this vaccine is possible to alleviate concerns of vaccine shortages or a need to quickly respond to an emergency.Hypothesis:  The hypothesis is that the VAX102 vaccine will be generally well-tolerated and will cause the development of antibodies to influenza virus in at least one dose level tested.Specific Aims and Procedures (summary):  The main purpose of the study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and tolerability of the VAX102 vaccine given as an injection into the muscle at 3 doses, 10 ¿¿g, 33 ¿¿g and 100 ¿¿g.  The vaccine will be given at Day 0 and a booster at Day 28 to healthy adults, 18-49 years of age.  Additional purposes of the study are to assess the immune response to the VAX102 vaccine.  Volunteers will be consented, screened, and enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled vaccine study, with a prime-boost design.  There are 3 dose groups, with 20 members to each group, to be enrolled starting with the lowest dose and increasing to the highest.  The first 8 members of each group will be evaluated with 7 day follow up data after receiving the first dose of vaccine.  Lab results and the type of reactions reported by individuals will be reviewed prior to enrolling the remaining 12 members of a group.  Before increasing to the next highest dose, each group of 20 will have their 7 day follow up data reviewed.  Lab results and the type of reactions reported by individuals for the entire group will be included in the review.  This information will be reviewed by a Safety Monitoring Committee.  Within each group of 20, the randomization will occur 3:1 for vaccine:placebo. Following the booster dose of vaccine to each group, the safety data for the next 7 day period will be reviewed, before recommending that the next group receive booster dosing. Laboratory studies will be performed to evaluate safety and immune response. Subjects will be asked to keep a diary of local reactions (i.e., redness or swelling) and systemic symptoms such as pain and fatigue.  Subjects will be followed frequently during the one month post each dose of study agent, and at other intervals during the 6 months following the first vaccine dose.Experimental Design (summary):  All data collected will be reported using descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages in each category.  Continuous variables will be summarized by dose group as numbers of subjects, means, standard deviations, medians, and minimum/maximum values.  Two-sided, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for immunogenicity endpoints and differences between each dose and placebo, and among dose groups.  Placebo subjects from all dose groups will be grouped together and used for summaries and analyses.  Since this is a Phase I study to assess safety and preliminary immunogenicity, no adjustments for multiple statistical testing will be required.  Significance (summary):  Development of an alternative influenza vaccine that will be protective across multiple influenza seasons and will be produced in a method that will allow for rapid production is critical to global health.  New approaches to influenza protection are a national priority.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pandemic potential of the Asian Influenza A H5N1 virus is one of the foremost international public health concerns of the 21st century. Ten probable and three possible pandemics have occurred in the past four-hundred years, with an average ten to forty year interpandemic interval. Our last pandemic occurred thirty-nine years ago. The exact timing of the next pandemic remains uncertain, but the fact that one will occur is not. In an interconnected modern world where infectious disease can be transmitted globally in a matter of hours, the WHO estimates that an H5N1 pandemic could cause hundreds of millions of deaths and the World Bank predicts a lasting and crippling impact on global economies could result, with losses of up to $4.4 trillion. While literature exists on public health strategies for current, epidemic, and pandemic Influenza A H5N1 infection scenarios, several important gaps remain. These include evaluating the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of potential strategies for responding to a pandemic. This project aims to build on my ongoing work in the field of pandemic influenza by: 1. Examining the long-term safety and effectiveness of extended prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. 2. Assessing the health outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies of response in a pandemic, including prophylaxis with neuraminidase inhibitors, prophylaxis with a promising new primeboost vaccination strategy, prophylaxis with masks and N-95 respirators, and no prophylaxis. Our world today differs from that of the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic not only in our global connections and the potential for rapid spread of an influenza virus, but also in our scientific advancements, knowledge, and international cooperation. As we observe Influenza A H5N1 spreading among avian, swine, feline, and canine species, and developing ongoing mutations which increase its ability to infect humans, we have an opportunity that physicians, scientists, and public health officials of 1918 did not. The results of these aims will add to the pandemic influenza literature by establishing safe, effective, and cost-effective strategies which will assist public health officials in preparing for this eventual threat.',\n",

       " 'We have identified a subpopulation of Treg that rapidly and specifically expand early during chronic (strain Clone 13) infection. At 17 days post infection (DPI), the total number of Vbeta5+ Treg is comparable to the total number of Foxp3+ Treg in a nave mouse. CD4+Vbeta5+ cells do not increase in frequency among Foxp3- cells, suggesting that this response is Treg-specific. A higher percentage of Vbeta5+ Treg express the activation markers CD101 and CD103, but lower levels of the co-inhibitory receptors ICOS and PD-1 compared to Vbeta5- Treg. Expansion of Vbeta5+ Treg is solely related to chronic LCMV infection and not to a difference between the strains of virus that result in acute (Armstrong) and chronic infection.  We have examined a number of different sources for the expanded Treg:  1) CD4+Vbeta5+ T cells may escape negative selection in the thymus during the infection and differentiate into Treg. However, the Treg response in adult thymectomized mice infected with LCMV Clone 13 appeared completely normal both in terms Vbeta5 expansion among Foxp3+ cells. 2) Treg differentiation can occur in the peripheral sites in response to TCR stimulation and TGF-beta. To test this hypothesis, we transferred Foxp3- cells into nave congenic C57/BL6 mice one day before LCMV Clone 13 infection.  Following infection, endogenous and transferred CD4+ T cells were analyzed to determine the percentage of cells expressing Foxp3.  Among the endogenous CD4+ T cells, the percentage of cells expressing Foxp3 increased similar to our previous results.  However, transferred CD4+ cells did not express any appreciable amount of Foxp3, suggesting that Treg are not generated de novo following Clone 13 infection.  3) Vbeta5+ Treg may preferentially expand following Clone 13 infection.  To test this, we injected bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into Clone 13 infected mice 7 days post infection (DPI) and analyzed the percentages of CD4+ T cells incorporating BrdU and expressing the cell cycle marker, Ki-67, 24 hours later.  CD4+Foxp3+Vbeta5+ cells had the highest percentage of BrdU+, Ki-67+ cells compared to all other CD4+ T cell populations, suggesting that, in fact, the observed expansion is due to an increased rate of cell division of the endogenous Vbeta5+ Tregs. However, when we injected Foxp3+ cells from congenic mice one day before Clone 13 infection, the percentage of the transferred cells expressing Vbeta5 on DPI 15 did not increase, while expansion of the endogenous Treg occurred normally. It remains possible that that Treg expansion may occur in a microenvironment that is not easily accessible to the transferred Treg. We are currently focusing on the gut as the site of Treg activation and expansion. In preliminary studies, mesenteric lymph node and lamina propria T cells of the small intestine had significantly higher percentages of Foxp3+V&#946;5+ Treg than any other lymphoid tissue examined.  We are currently focusing on determining how the microenvironment of the gut may influence Treg expansion in chronic infection.It is likely that the expansion of the Treg is driven by T cell receptor driven stimulation, but the specificity of antigen recognition by Treg remains a controversial issue. Treg have been shown to recognize both autoantigens as well as pathogen-derived antigens. To determine whether the Treg specifically recognize an LCMV-derived antigen, we developed an in vitro proliferation assay in which we stimulated Treg with overlapping peptides that span the entire LCMV proteome. We have assayed 224 peptides that span the entire glycoprotein, nucleocapsid and Z protein, but have not observed a Treg response to an LCMV peptide. In addition, Treg from chronically infected mice (both Vbeta5+ and Vbeta5-) do not bind an immunodominant LCMV peptide-MHC class II tetramer Taken together, these data suggest that the expanded Treg in mice chronically infected with LCMV are not specific to a viral peptide epitope.Because the expansion of the Treg is restricted to a specific Vbeta segment, it is possible that activation of these cells is secondary to recognition a superantigen that binds outside the peptide/MHC binding region. We have sequenced the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR from multiple clones derived from Vbeta5+ Treg and observed that the profile is quite polyclonal. Sequence data from three individual mice did not reveal any public clones that were shared among any of the animals and <25% of the sequences from any individual mouse were conserved.  We have shown that the expansion of Vbeta5+ Treg in Clone 13 infection is CD4-independent, but MHC class II- dependent.  Lastly, the expansion of Vbeta5+ Treg is conserved among a few different inbred strains of mice with different H-2 haplotypes.  For example, in BALB/c mice, Vbeta5+ Treg (in addition to Vbeta12+) specifically expand during Clone 13 infection. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that the expansion of the Treg is superantigen driven.  Our main goal over the next year is to determine the source of the superantigen. We are focusing on the shared endogenous retroviral superantigens and/or superantigens that may be present in the gut flora. We are in the process of generating mice with a greatly reduced gut flora and will infect these mice with clone 13 and determine whether expansion of the Treg is inhibited. We believe these studies have potential relevance to other chronic infections such as HIV that also involve infection of the GI tract.The major issue to be addressed in the next year is to determine the impact of the Treg expansion on the course and outcome of the chronic infection.  We have had difficulties in the past in the execution of these studies because of the limited tools that can be used to deplete Treg from mice either before or during the course of the chronic infection. We have recently obtained mice that express the human diphtheria toxin receptor under control of the mouse Foxp3 promoter. Treatment of these mice with diptheria toxin results in a profound, but transient, depletion of Foxp3+ Treg. In preliminary studies, depletion of Treg prior to  Clone 13 infection resulted in an enhancement of the activation of CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells modulate the level of CD8 cell exhaustion during chronic infection, we also plan to use this depletion model to help tease out the role that Treg may be playing in this process. One possibility is that Treg modulate viral antigen presentation by DC and thereby inhibit the activation of virus-specific CD4+ cells.',\n",
       " 'La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, is a mosquito-borne virus recognized as a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America with 70-130 symptomatic cases each year. The virus was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl who suffered encephalitis and died in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The majority of LACV infections are mild and never reported, however, serologic studies estimate infection rates of 10-30/100,000 in endemic areas.  LAC encephalitis has become the most commonly reported pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the US with 70-130 symptomatic cases a year with severe sequelae. For these reasons we are interested in developing a vaccine to prevent this CNS disease.  Sequence analysis of the complete LACV genomes of low-passage LACVhuman1960, LACVmosquito1978, and LACVhuman1978 strains and of biologically cloned derivatives of each strain, indicates that circulating LACVs are genetically stable over time and geographic distance with 99.6-100%, 98.9-100%, 97.8-99.6%, and 99.2-99.7% amino acid identity for N, NSs, M polyprotein, and L proteins respectively. Following the intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, LACV replicated in various organs before reaching the CNS where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease.  The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal cavity, and, presumably, LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium.  The mouse infectious dose50 and lethal dose50 was very similar (<500 PFU) for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally (moribundity is used as a humane surrogate for lethality in all mouse studies). The ability to efficiently infect mice by the intranasal route raises the possibility that LACV might use this route as one of several ways to infect its natural hosts.  It would be very interesting to examine if LACV can be detected in water in tree holes harboring LACV infected mosquito larvae.  It is possible that LACV present in the tree hole water (the virus being derived from transovarially infected mosquito larvae) could initiate an infection of the epithelium of the respiratory tract of the mammals that drink the water in the tree holes.LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 PFU.  However, the infection was asymptomatic, and the level of replication of LACV, as indicated by viremia and titer of virus in lymph nodes, was very low.  Despite the low level of identifiable LACV in the monkeys following peripheral inoculation, a strong neutralizing antibody response was elicited.  Rhesus monkeys can therefore be used to study the effect of an attenuating mutation on the level of immunogenicity and on the infectivity of a vaccine candidate.  In this manner, attenuating mutants that adversely affect immunogenicity or infectivity can be eliminated from further consideration as vaccine candidates.  As discussed above, the pathogenesis of LACV for the CNS of rhesus monkeys will be studied following intracerebral inoculation of virus. This will permit the identification of vaccine candidates that are restricted for replication in the CNS of non-human primates, but that are immunogenic and infectious by a peripheral route. A reverse genetics system for LACV has previously been reported by others and was used to generate a virus lacking a functional NSs ORF (NSs KO).  We have reproduced this system and have recovered a set of rLACV viruses with the NSs KO mutation, the E577G mutation in GC, or the T148A mutation in GN either as a single mutation or in various combinations. The rLACV mutants are being evaluated for neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, and for level of replication in the CNS of mice.  Their level of infectivity and immunogenicity will be evaluated in non-human primates to determine if they are infectious, attenuated, and immunogenic for non-human primates.  Additional attenuating mutations are being developed for studying the pathogenesis of LACV in mice and for inclusion in a vaccine candidate.  Six paired-charge-to-alanine mutations in the N protein have been made, and viruses bearing these mutations have been recovered. These mutants are being further characterized in vitro and in vivo.  In addition, numerous LACV mutants have been isolated following growth in the presence of the mutagen 5-FU and have been screened for reduced replication in cells of neural origin.  To date, two mutant viruses have been identified that replicate efficiently in Vero cells but are restricted for replication in neural cells and that have reduced lethality for mice in vivo.  The genetic basis of attenuation of these mutants is currently being determined, a complicated task since they contain multiple sequence differences in comparison with their wt LACV parent.Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), family Bunyaviridae, is a mosquito-borne pathogen endemic in the United States and Canada.  JCV was first isolated from Culiseta inornata mosquitoes collected near Jamestown Canyon, northwest of Boulder, Colorado.  JCV is a member of the California serogroup of viruses in the genus Orthobunyavirus. JCV is an insect-vectored virus with a large geographic range, including much of the United States and Canada. The virus is genetically similar to Inkoo virus circulating in Europe, suggesting most of the northern hemisphere contains JCV or similar variants.  The main vectors for the virus are Aedes and Ochlerotatus mosquito species, but the virus has been isolated from 26 species of mosquitoes and 3 species of tabanid flies.  In the US, white-tailed deer are the primary amplifying host, but mule deer, sika deer, moose, and bison have also been infected.  Antibodies have also been detected in horses and goats. In humans, the virus causes mild febrile illness as well as infection of the CNS resulting in meningitis and encephalitis. Serologic evidence suggests a 4-11% infection rate, with JCV infection more common in some areas than LACV.  In humans, JCV disease appears to be milder than LACV and generally affects adults, whereas LACV preferentially causes disease in children.  JCV disease is generally associated with headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Although, JCV infection has been diagnosed by PCR of a brain biopsy, reports of human isolates of JCV have not been made. As an initial step in the development of a JCV vaccine, we established both mouse and monkey infection models for wild-type JCV infection. JCV was less neuroinvasive following intraperitoneal inoculation than LACV, however the virus was highly infectious with a resulting mouse infectious dose50 and lethal dose50 of 6 and 60,000 PFU, respectively.   The virus was highly neurovirulent with an intracerebral lethal dose50 of 16 PFU.JCV was infectious for rhesus monkeys with 7 of 8 of the animals infected after subcutaneous inoculation with 5 log10 PFU as indicated by a rise in antibody titer.  As with LACV, the infection was asymptomatic, however JCV infection did result in a detectable viremia in 6 of 8 monkeys ranging from 5  1000 PFU/mL serum on days 2-4 post-infection.  Since both viremia and a neutralizing antibody response are observed, rhesus monkeys can be used to study the effect of an attenuating mutation on the level of replication, immunogenicity, and on the infectivity of a JCV vaccine candidate.  In this manner, attenuating mutants that adversely effect immunogenicity or infectivity can be eliminated from further consideration as vaccine candidates.  We also determined the antigenic relatedness of LACV and JCV in rhesus monkeys comparing post-infection serum neutralizing antibody titers  they are only 3 to 9% related, suggesting that separate vaccines would be needed to optimally protect against LACV and JCV.',\n",

       " 'Aim 1:The rationale for testing further this vector in a macaque model is several       folds. 1). ALVAC is an avian vector; therefore pre-existing immunity is not a factor that       could enhance HIV infectivity. This is particularly important now in the face of recent       results with the adenovirus based HIV vaccine trial (STEP trial) whereby five fold increase       transmission of HIV was observed in individuals (not circumcised) that had high levels of       prior immunity to the vector. 2). The results of the phase III trial with an ALVAC HIV vaccine       III in combination with a gp120 protein boost will become available in 2009. If any protection       is scored in the 16,000 volunteers, and we demonstrate in the present study an improvement on       the ALVAC-SIV based vaccine immunogenicity in combination with DNA, our data are likely to       influence the design of future clinical trials. 3). We need to test the improved vector in       macaques because the readout of protection in the SIVmac251 macaque model is now proposed by       several investigators as a gold standard for the go ahead to further clinical trials ( Summit       Vaccine meeting on March 25). 4). DNA/ALVAC-SIV vaccine has not been tested in the SIVmac251       macaque model and several preclinical studies using poxvirus vaccine candidates for HIV have       shown enhanced immunogenicity and protection when macaques were primed with DNA. In the recent       Vaccine Summit organized by the NIAID director, Anthony Fauci,a clear consensus emerged on the       utility of using SIVSM in challenge studies to test the breadth of protection from high virus       level/disease induced by T-cells. An extreme point of view (in my opinion) proposed by some       scientist is the idea of using SIVSM the as a gate keeper for decision to move vaccines to       human trials. To date, very few studies in nonhuman primates have addressed directly the issue       of HIV genetic variability. Our previous studies have demonstrated an acceptable level of       protection from disease in a rigorous viral challenge (SIVmac251) macaque model using a       combination of vaccine modalities and, at this time, it seems appropriate to assess the degree       of protection, if any, induced by a polyvalent DNA prime/ALVAC-SIV boost vaccine regimen. The       scientific goals of this aim are to improve the immunogenicity of an ALVAC-SIV vaccine in a       DNA prime /ALVAC-SIV boost and to assess cross-clade protection by testing a SIVmac251-based       vaccine against a mucosal challenge with a homologous and heterologous virus, SIVSME660. The       preclinical data obtained in this study will begin to address the issue of cross-clade       protection and perhaps provide a proof of concept on whether protection from disease by T cell       vaccines is attainable against a divergent virus. In one group of animals we will define the       level of protection from homologous challenge with SIVmac251, and it is expected to be       equivalent as in the previous study. In the second ,immunized in a manner identical to that of       the first group we will challenge intrarectally with SIVSME660 (15;16), kindly provided by       V.M. Hirsch. The end points of this study will be immunological, virological, and clinical. If       a reasonable degree of protection is observed strategies to further ameliorate immunogenicity       of this approach (adjuvanted DNAs, CD40L expressed by ALVAC etc) will be explored. In aim 1 we       wish to test the hypothesis that continuous expression of low level of SIV antigen(s) in the       gut may maintain a sufficient level of effector CD8 memory cells able to decrease early       seeding of the virus and sufficient level of central memory cells that may limit the       broadcasting of the virus at distal sites. To do so we will explore the potential usefulness       of an HIV vaccine vectored in the HTLV-II backbone. HTLV-II, is a human retrovirus that does       not cause disease neither in healthy nor in HIV-I infected individuals. We have obtained       evidence that indeed HTLV-II infects macaques and replicates at very low level in lymphoid       tissue and particularly in the gut. Importantly HTLV-II infects dendritic cells both in vivo       and in vitro and HTLV-II infected dendritic cells have a mature phenotype. We are currently       preparing constructs of HTLV-II that express either the SIV Gag or fragments of SIV envelope       to test the hypothesis proposed above. Aim 2 :we plan to develop an HTLV-II vectored HIV       vaccine and explore the potential of HPV as a delivery system for an HIV vaccine Most of the       T-cell vaccines developed for HIV are based on microbial vectors that have limited replication       capacity and do not persist in the host. HTLV-II persist in the and replicates at very low       level in the gut of the host. thus an HTLV--II vectored vaccine that replicate at mucosal       sites might provide constitutive and effective T-cell responses as well as induce mucosal       humoral immunity. HPV infects,in the appropriate conditions, the vaginal mucosa. Because most       transmission of HIV worldwide are heterosexual,The HPV vaccine platform may be ideal to induce       mucosal T-cell responses',\n",
       " 'Aim 1 We have designed a study in macaques to assess more directly the role of CD8       SIV-specific responses in control of viral replication. Depletion of CD4+ cells was performed       in the immunized macaques at the peak of SIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses following DNA       prime. An additional group of macaques immunized in normal condition was depleted of CD8+       T-cells prior challenge exposure to SIVmac251. Analysis of the quality and quantity of vaccine       induced CD8+ T cells demonstrated that SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells generated in conditions of       CD4+ T-cell deficiency expressed low levels of Bcl2 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and plasma virus       level increased over time in these animals. Depletion of CD8+ T-cells prior challenge exposure       abrogated vaccine-induced protection as expected. These data support the notion that adaptive       CD4+ T-cells are critical for the generation of effective CD8+ T-cell responses to SIV that in       turn contribute to protection from AIDS. Importantly, they also suggest that long-term       protection from disease will only be afforded by T-cell vaccines for HIV that provide a       balanced induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and protect against early depletion of       CD4+ T-cells post-infection. Aim 2 Negative regulatory molecules (CTLA-4 ,IDO ,FoxP3 and       PD-1) and regulatory cells (Th17) at systemic and mucosal compartment of SIV infected       macaques. High levels of viral replication occur in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and       other lymphoid tissues (LT) since the early phase of human/simian immunodeficiency virus       (HIV/SIV) infection. Regulatory T cells (Treg), a subset of immunosuppressive T cells       expressing CTLA-4 and the FoxP3 transcription factor, accumulate in LT during HIV/SIV       infection. We have shown that FoxP3 and CTLA-4 mRNA are increased in leukocytes from the       spleens, lymph nodes (LN), and mucosal sites of chronically SIV-infected macaques with high       viremia (SIVHI) compared to animals with low viremia (SIVLO). FoxP3 and CTLA-4 correlated with       SIV RNA levels in tissues; SIV virus levels in the spleen, inguinal LN, mesenteric LN, colon,       and jejunum directly correlated with the plasma virus level. Importantly, CTLA-4 and FoxP3       mRNA were predominantly increased in the CD25 subpopulation of leukocytes from SIVHI, further       challenging the classical definition of Treg as CD4+ CD25+ T cells. Similar to CTLA-4 and       FoxP3, expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an immunosuppressive enzyme induced by       Treg in antigen-presenting cells, was increased in the spleens, mesenteric LN, colons, and       jejuna from SIVHI compared to SIVLO and directly correlated to SIV RNA in the same tissues.       Accordingly, plasma kynurenine/tryptophan, a marker for IDO enzymatic activity, was       significantly higher in SIVHI compared to SIVLO and correlated with plasma viral levels.       Collectively these data suggested two alternative hypothesis: a) the increased Treg and IDO in       LT of SIV-infected macaques may be an attempt of the host to diminish tissue inflammation and       virus replication in the chronic phase of SIV infection (Tregs help the host); b) the       increased in Tregs may decrease the immune response and allow viral replication (tregs help       the virus). Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a critical mediator of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell       exhaustion. Here, we examined the expression of PD-1 on simian immunodeficiency virus       (SIV)-specific CD8+ T cells and its possible involvement in regulation of cytokine production,       proliferation, and survival of these cells. The majority of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells       expressed a PD-1(high) phenotype, independent of their differentiation status, in all tissues       tested. PD-1 expression gradually declined on CD8+ T cells specific for SIV-derived epitopes       that had undergone mutational escape, indicating that antigen-specific TCR stimulation is the       primary determinant of PD-1 expression. Loss of CD4+ T-cells in the gut is necessary but not       sufficient to cause AIDS in animal models, raising the possibility that a differential loss of       CD4+ T-cell subtypes may be important. We found that CD4+T-cells that produce IL-17 , a       recently identified lineage of effector CD4+ T-helper cells, are infected by SIVmac251 in       vitro and in vivo, and are found at lower frequency at mucosal and systemic sites within a few       weeks from infection . In animals that progress to disease TH1 cells predominates on Th17       T-cells whereas in SIVmac251-infected elite controllers macaques a normal balance between       these CD4+T subtypes is maintained. Indeed regression analysis of the frequency of TH17 cells       at mucosal sites and plasma virus level, demonstrates a negative correlation suggesting their       importance in HIV/SIV pathogenesis. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and       adaptive immune response to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic       enteropathy in HIV infection. Aim 3: Pharmacological Manipulation of T-cells, with cytokines,       IL7 , IL-15 and IL-21 ,or with drugs that target the immune regulatory molecules CTLA-4 ,IDO,       PD-1 of SIV infected macaques. IL7&IL-15: The loss of CD4+ T cells and the impairment       of CD8+ T cell function in HIV infection suggest that pharmacological treatment with IL-7 and       IL-15, cytokines that increase the homeostatic proliferation of T cells and improve effector       function, may be beneficial. However, these cytokines could also have a detrimental effect in       HIV-1-infected individuals, because both cytokines increase HIV replication in vitro. We       assessed the impact of IL-7 and IL-15 treatment on viral replication and the immunogenicity of       live poxvirus vaccines in SIVmac251-infected macaques (Macaca mulatta). Neither cytokine       augmented the frequency of vaccine-expanded CD4+ or CD8+ memory T cells, clonal recruitment to       the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell pool, or CD8+ T cell function. Vaccination alone transiently       decreased the viral set point following antiretroviral therapy suspension. IL-15 induced       massive proliferation of CD4+ effector T cells and abrogated the ability of vaccination to       decrease set point viremia. In contrast, IL-7 neither augmented nor decreased the vaccine       effect and was associated with a decrease in TGF- expression. These results underscore the       importance of testing immunomodulatory approaches in vivo to assess potential risks and       benefits for HIV-1-infected individuals. CTLA-4: We directly addressed the impact of immune       activation by inhibiting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), an immunoregulatory       molecule expressed on activated T-cells and a subset of regulatory T-cells (Treg). We found       that CTLA-4 blockade significantly increased T-cell activation and viral replication in       primary SIVmac251 infection, particularly at mucosal sites, and increased indoleamine       2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression and activity. Accordingly, protracted treatment with       anti-CTLA-4 antibody of macaques chronically infected with SIVmac251 decreased esponsiveness       to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and abrogated the ability of therapeutic T-cell vaccines to       decrease viral set point. These data provide the first direct evidence that immune activation       drives viral replication, and suggest caution in the use of therapeutic approaches for HIV       infection in vivo that increase CD4+ T-cell proliferation.

       " 'The HVS in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium, has developed several candidate live attenuated HAV vaccines. One such candidate was modified to become the currently licensed GSK inactivated HAV vaccine. In addition, the HVS has developed a candidate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine that is highly promising and that has recently completed clinical trials. In studies to further characterize this candidate hepatitis E vaccine, we have performed extensive pre-clinical trials to determine the potency of the vaccine, the duration of protection, the optimum regimen for administration, its protective efficacy against homologous versus heterologous virus strains, its ability to prevent infection as well as hepatitis and the minimum antibody titer that was effective in preventing infection and hepatitis, respectively. In the clinical trial, the vaccine was 96% efficacious in preventing hepatitis E following three doses of vaccine and 87% efficacious following two doses.  The vaccine had no detectable side effects.  These results are outstanding for a vaccine.  GSK is currently determining its plans for future manufacture and distribution of the vaccine.The study of HCV, including vaccine development, is complicated by the genetic heterogeneity of the virus, which has resulted in at least six major genotypes and many subtypes.  Detecting and quantifying the virus requires different sets of primers for PCR amplification.  We have developed real-time PCR assays for the six major genotypes and have compared their specificity and sensitivity with other published essays.Immunity  to HCV is poorly understood and there is controversy over how complete and how long-lasting immunity to prior exposure of the virus is.  Here, we have demonstrated that immunity to repeated exposure to HCV is genotype-specific, incomplete and relatively short-lived: even reexposure to the homologous virus can result in persistent infection.In other studies, GB virus-B (GBV-B) immunity was further studied. GBV-B is the closest relative to hepatitis C virus, which is very difficult to study because it is  transmissible only to chimpanzees. In contrast, GBV-B is transmissible to tamarins, a species of New World monkey not considered to be endangered. Tamarins that had previously been infected with GBV-B were re-challenged with the same virus and shown to be immune to reinfection; this immunity was long-lived and apparently more complete than immunity to HCV in chimpanzees and humans.In 2008, in collaboration with Michael Houghton (formerly of Chiron Corp.), we tested sera from Chirons HCV vaccine trials in chimpanzees,  Specifically, we tested serial sera from chimpanzees that had received Chirons E1-E2 dimer vaccine (derived from the HCV-1 strain) that had been expressed from mammalian cells.  Testing was performed with pseudo-typed retrovirus particles bearing the envelope glycoproteins of each of the major HCV genotypes (HCVpp).  The magnitude of the antibody response against HCVpp bearing the envelope glycoproteins of a heterologous genotype 1a strain  (H77C) paralleled the degree of protection of the chimpanzees: those animals with a high titer of neutralizing antibody against HCVpp were protected, whereas those with a lower titer were not.  In addition, the neutralizing antibody was broadly cross-reactive, also neutralizing principally HCVpp bearing envelope glycoproteins of HCV genotypes 4a, 5a and 6a as well as those bearing the envelope glycoproteins of genoytpe 1a (manuscript in preparation).  We also tested in chimpanzees an HCV vaccine consisting of expressed HCV E1 protein, either with or without expressed HCV NS3 protein.  The vaccine was manufactured by Innogenetics N.V. and was tested under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the company.  In contrast to the experience with the Chiron vaccine, none of the chimpanzees was protected from infection or from persistent infection and none had neutralizing antibody to HCV as measured with the HCVpp test.  The decisive results of this study led to the abandonment of the E1 vaccine by Innogenetics.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to preventive HIV vaccines conducted at the VRC Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center.

       " 'Internal death programs play significant roles in many diseases.  Pathogenic effects can result from inefficient cell death or from inappropriate or excessive death such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during AIDS or the SAR-CoV virus during SARS. In this project, we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular mechanisms of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death programs in lymphocytes as well as other cell types. A major focus of our investigations are death-inducing cell surface receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as TNFR1 and CD95/Fas/APO-1.  Both receptors play an important role in stimulating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death of cells principally in immune processes. Little is known about how these alternative death pathways are entrained to receptor signaling.  Interestingly, both receptors can have effects beside death such as the induction of transcription factors. We are trying to understand how these receptors stimulate the intracellular machinery that causes cell death in preference to other cellular outcomes. We have devoted many of our efforts  to understanding the activation of a protease called caspase-8 which regulates the death program. We have characterized two death programs that emanate from TNFR1 and the Fas receptor, one which is caspase-8 dependent and has an apoptotic morphology and the other which is caspase-8 independent and involves necrosis. Interestingly, the latter death program is only observed when caspase-8 is inhibited. The regulation and molecular pathways of these two forms of lymphocyte death are distinct. In addition, we have discovered that inhibition of caspase-8 in non-lymphoid cells can lead to another form of cell death  exhibiting particular cytoplasmic double membrane structures called autophagy.  Although initially controversial, several labs have now shown that this form of death is particularly important for the demise of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. We have now shown that the mechanism of autophagic death program is selective degradation of catalase which leads to a marked overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage and death. Furthermore, we have focused on genes that play key roles in this process of death.  We have found that the human homologue of the Drosophila spinster protein, called hSpin, is essential for autophagic cell death.  We have studied the biochemical function of this protein and found that it is important for proper lysosome biogenesis and vesicle trafficking. In particular, it plays a vital role in lysosomal resomation at the end of  autophagy.  These studies will shed light on nonapoptotic death mechanisms.\\tIn parallel, we are exploring how the regulation of cellular death programs may play a role in cytopathicity associated with virus infections in AIDS and SARS.  In particular, a critical effect in the onset of AIDS following infection with HIV is the death of T lymphocytes caused by the virus. We have found that this death process is necrotic rather than apoptotic and have now identified two viral gene products, vif and vpr, that are involved in this process. We have found that vpr alters the cell cycle and promote death by binding to cellular proteins that have a role in cell cycle progression.  In order to study this process rigorously we have constructed a mathematical model to analyze cell death in tissue culture during HIV infection. Remarkably, both of these cytotoxic gene products cause says cycle arrest at the boundary of the G2 and M phases. The mathematical model reveals that the principal cause of cell loss is cell death rather than cell cycle arrest. We are using molecular genetic approaches to determine if cell cycle arrest actually causes cell death and how this might come about. The HIV vpr protein is a small protein (100 amino acids) with no obvious structural domains or enzymatic motifs other than three alpha helices.  We have determined that vpr promotes the formation of an apparently abortive complex between mitotic regulators such as CyclinB and Cdk1, and the theta isoform of the 14-3-3 protein which inhibits the cell cycle in the G2 phase.  The complex appears to be nucleated by a particular hydrophobic patch on the third helix of the vpr protein. We have also studied how vif causes cell cycle arrest and found that it is a distinctive mechanism from that induced by vpr.  We find that vif can alter the nucleocytoplasmic localization of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases which leads to disruption of normal cell cycle progression.  We continue to explore how HIV-1 alters to cellular  machinery to cause the demise of CD4 T cells.In contrast to HIV, the human coronavirus that causes SARS, SARS-CoV, causes necrotic cell death that does not involve cell cycle arrest.  We have found that cell death can be traced to a novel open reading frame, termed ORF 3a, that is present in SARS-CoV but not other less pathological human coronaviruses.  The cellular effect of ORF3a is to cause a dramatic reorganization of the Golgi apparatus which has lethal effects on the cell.  We are now trying to established a molecular pathway entrained to ORF3a that causes this cytopathic effect.  Thus far,  our data implicate the TGN38 protein that is primarily found in the trans portion of the Golgi as the main direct target of the ORF3a protein.  Further experiments will be directed at understanding the mechanism of how SARS triggers a lethal event through the alteration of the Golgi apparatus.  Contributing to the lethality of ORF3a is an adjacent gene called ORF3b.  This protein traffics from the nucleus to the mitochondrion during the course of SARS infection and we are studying how this impacts the ultimate fate of the cell.  Preliminary evidence suggests that it has an inimical effect on the normal interferon response against viral infection and we are currently exploring the molecular basis of this effect.',\n",
       " 'Pilot study of vaccination with recombinant CEA-MUC-1-TRICOM poxviral-based vaccines in       patients with metastatic carcinoma. Poxviral vectors have a proven safety record and can be       used to incorporate multiple transgenes. Prior clinical trials with poxviral vaccines have       shown that immunologic tolerance to self-antigens can be broken. Carcinoembryonic antigen       (CEA) and breast cancer-associated epithelial mucin (MUC-1) are overexpressed in a substantial       proportion of common solid carcinomas. The primary end point of this study was vaccine safety,       with immunologic and clinical responses as secondary end points. We report here a pilot study       of 25 patients treated with a poxviral vaccine regimen consisting of the genes for CEA and       MUC-1, along with a triad of costimulatory molecules (TRICOM; composed of B7.1, ICAM-1, and       LFA-3) engineered into vaccinia (PANVAC-V) as a prime vaccination and into fowlpox (PANVAC-F)       as a booster vaccination. The vaccine was well tolerated. Apart from injection-site reaction,       no grade &#8805;2 toxicity was seen in more than 2% of the cycles. Immune responses to       MUC-1 and/or CEA were seen following vaccination in 9 of 16 patients tested. A patient with       clear cell ovarian cancer and symptomatic ascites had a durable (18-month) clinical response       radiographically and biochemically, and one breast cancer patient had a confirmed decrease of       more than 20% in the size of large liver metastasis. This vaccine strategy seems to be safe, is       associated with both CD8 and CD4 immune responses, and has shown evidence of clinical       activity. Further trials with this agent, either alone or in combination with       immunopotentiating and other therapeutic agents, are warranted. Safety and immunologic       response of a viral vaccine to prostate-specific antigen in combination with radiation therapy       when metronomic-dose Interleukin 2 is used as an adjuvant. We have previously reported on the       safety and immunologic response of a poxvirus-based vaccine encoding prostate-specific antigen       (PSA) used in combination with radiation therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer.       We hypothesized that a metronomic dose of interleukin 2 (IL-2) as a biological adjuvant would       cause less toxicity while maintaining immunologic response. Eighteen patients with localized       prostate cancer were treated in a single arm trial using previously established doses of       vaccine and radiation therapy. The vaccine used was a recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to       encode PSA admixed with a recombinant vaccinia encoding the costimulatory molecule B7.1,       followed by booster vaccinations with a recombinant fowlpox vector expressing       prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Definitive external beam radiation therapy was initiated       after the third vaccination cycle. Patients were evaluated for safety and immunologic       response. Toxicity and immunologic activity were compared with the previously reported regimen       containing a higher dose of IL-2. Seventeen of 18 patients received all eight cycles of       vaccine with IL-2. Five of eight HLA-A2+ patients evaluated had an increase in PSA-specific T       cells of &#8805;3-fold. Toxicities were generally mild, with only seven vaccination       cycles of 140 given resulting in grade 3 toxicities possibly attributable to IL-2.       Metronomic-dose IL-2 in combination with vaccine and radiation therapy is safe, can induce       prostate-specific immune responses, and has immunologic activity similar to low-dose IL-2,       with markedly reduced toxicities. Clinical safety of a viral vector based prostate cancer       vaccine strategy. The primary objective of this phase I study was to evaluate the clinical       safety of a vaccine using recombinant vaccinia virus (prime) and recombinant fowlpox virus       (boost) in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in patients with       prostate cancer. The vaccines contained transgenes for prostate specific antigen, a triad of       co-stimulatory molecules and a tumor antigen whose amino acid sequence had been modified to       enhance its immunogenicity. Secondary end points were immunological and clinical responses,       changes in prostate specific antigen velocity, and the kinetics of vaccinia virus clearance       from the vaccination site, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, urine and saliva. Based       on the safety and preliminary immunogenicity results of this trial we recommend initiating a       randomized, phase II study of prostate specific antigen/triad of co-stimulatory molecules       vaccines in patients with less advanced prostate cancer. Analysis of overall survival in       patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with vaccine,       nilutamide, and combination therapy. We reported previously the first randomized study of any       kind in patients with nonmetastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study employed       vaccine, the hormone nilutamide, and the combined therapy (crossover for each arm) with an       endpoint of time to progression. We now report survival analyses at 6.5 years from the       initiation of therapy with a median potential follow-up of 4.4 years. Forty-two patients were       randomized to receive either a poxvirus-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine or       nilutamide. Patients in either arm who developed increasing PSA without radiographic evidence       of metastasis could cross over to receive the combined therapies. Median survival among all       patients was 4.4 years from date of enrollment. Median survival exhibited a trend toward       improvement for patients initially randomized to the vaccine arm (median, 5.1versus 3.4 years;       P = 0.13). Starting from the on-study date, the retrospectively determined subset of 12       patients who initially received vaccine and then later received nilutamide suggested improved       survival compared with the 8 patients who began with nilutamide and subsequently were treated       with vaccine (median, 6.2 versus 3.7 years; P = 0.045). A subgroup analysis of patients       randomized to the vaccine arm versus the nilutamide arm showed substantial improvements in       survival if at baseline patients had a Gleason score less than 7 (P = 0.033) and PSA less than 20       ng/dL (P = 0.013) or who had prior radiation therapy (P = 0.018). These data indicate that       patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (D0.5) who receive vaccine       before second-line hormone therapy may potentially result in improved survival compared with       patients who received hormone therapy and then vaccine. These data also suggest that patients       with more indolent disease may derive greater clinical benefit from vaccine alone or vaccine       before second-line hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy       followed by vaccine. These findings have potential implications for both the design and       endpoint analysis of larger vaccine combination therapy trials.',\n",
       " \"include coordinating technical evaluations of proposed test methods of multi-agency interest and providing recommendations regarding their usefulness to appropriate Federal agencies. ICCVAM also coordinates cross-agency issues on validation, acceptance, and national/international harmonization of toxicological test methods. NICEATM administers and provides operational and scientific support for the ICCVAM, and collaborates with ICCVAM to carry out related validation activities such as peer reviews and workshops for test methods of interest to Federal agencies.Independent validation studies are coordinated by NICEATM as resources permit. The goal of NICEATM and ICCVAM is to promote the scientific validation and regulatory acceptance of new test methods that are more predictive of human, animal, and ecological effects than currently available methods, including methods that will refine (lessen pain and distress), reduce, and replace animal use whenever scientifically feasible.To achieve this goal, NICEATM collaborates with ICCVAM to evaluate new test methods of multi-agency interest.Independent peer review panels are convened to develop scientific consensus on the usefulness and limitations of test methods and to generate information for specific human health and/or ecological risk assessment purposes. Expert workshops and expert panel meetings are convened to evaluate the adequacy of current methods for assessing specific toxicities, to identify areas in need of improved or new methods, to evaluate proposed validation studies, to evaluate the interim validation status of methods, and to develop recommendations for research, development, and validation studies needed to further evaluate or improve the usefulness of various test methods.On October 31, 2005, ICCVAM received a nomination from the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) requesting that alternative test methods to the mouse LD50 assay for Botulinum toxin potency testing be assessed and prioritized for prevalidation and validation efforts.An initial step in this process was for ICCVAM to organize a workshop that would be coordinated with ECVAM and other appropriate stakeholders to secure the cooperation of individuals and organizations that possess relevant protocols and test data.Following this workshop, HSUS proposes that ICCVAM work with appropriate partners to validate one or more of the alternative assays as a replacement of the mouse LD50 test.In response to this nomination, ICCVAM recommended that a workshop should be given a high priority. ICCVAM presented this recommendation to SACATM at their December 12, 2005 meeting.SACATM endorsed the ICCVAM recommendation that a workshop should be given a high priority.A workshop is took place in May 2006. The Director of NICEATM was invited to participate on the advisory board of the ACuteTox Consortium, an integrated project funded by the EC. The Consortium consists of 35 partners from academia, industry, partners from small and medium enterprises, governmental institutions, and partners from international organizations, including the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European In Vitro Testing Industrial Platform, the European Society of Toxicology In Vitro and the European Consensus-Platform for Alternatives.A NICEATM representative participated in the ACuteTox Consortium meeting held in Alicante, Spain on October 26-28, 2005, and gave a presentation on the status of the NICEATM/ECVAM Validation Study of In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays. ICCVAM/NICEATM members participated in a workshop, Progress and Barriers to Incorporating Alternative Toxicological Methods in the U.S., on November 17 and 18, 2005 in Baltimore, Maryland.The objective of this workshop was to summarize progress in implementing new, revised and alternative toxicological test methods across regulatory evaluation frameworks and decision-making programs in the United States, identify  technical,regulatory,economic,orsocietalbarriersandexplore potential bridges to facilitate overcoming such barriers to progress. The workshop produced: Better understanding of current alternatives research and validation efforts in the United States (who, what, objectives of research; availability of resources), enhanced understanding of the environment motivating alternatives research and how this is or is not linked with the regulatory communities who rely on test methods, Identification and understanding of barriers that impede progress, and recommendations to overcome these barriers.The inauguration of the newly established JaCVAM took place November 29 to December 3, 2005 at an international conference held in Tokyo, Japan in conjunction with the JSAAE.Participants included members of the Japanese National Institutes of Health Sciences (NIHS), ECVAM, ICCVAM, NICEATM, and JaCVAM, as well as scientists involved in the field of alternatives in Korea and China.The Chair of ICCVAM was invited to co-chair a plenary session on the establishment of JaCVAM, focusing on the International Partnership on Alternatives.The Director of NICEATM was invited to present a memorial lecture on the Development of Alternative Methods in the U.S. and the Chair of ICCVAM also was invited to present a memorial lecture on International Cooperation of the Validation and Evaluation of Alternative Methods. In June 2005, ECVAM submitted five in vitro human blood cell pyrogenicity tests to the ICCVAM for consideration. These tests were being proposed as replacements for the currently required in vivo rabbit test or an in vitro test that requires the use of hemolymph collected from the Limulus horseshoe crab (Limulus amoebocyte lysate [LAL] test, also referred to as the bacterial endotoxin test [BET]).However, these test methods are similar in that each assay involves the measurement of cytokine levels from either human blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), or a human monocytoid cell line, as a biomarker of a pyrogenic response.In each assay, cytokine levels are measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The five in vitro pyrogenicity test methods are identified as follows:PBMC/IL-6 (The Human PBMC/IL-6 In Vitro Pyrogen Test), WB/IL-1 (The Human Whole Blood/IL-1 In Vitro Pyrogen Test), cryo WB/IL-1 (The Human Whole Blood/IL-1 In Vitro Pyrogen Test: Application of cryopreserved human whole blood), WB/IL-6 (The Human Whole Blood/IL-6 In Vitro Pyrogen Test), and MM6/IL6 (An Alternative In Vitro Pyrogen Test Using the Human Monocytoid Cell Line MONO MAC-6 [MM6]).NICEATM announced the availability of the report entitled, ICCVAM Test Method Evaluation Report:In Vitro Ocular Toxicity Test Methods for Identifying Severe Irritants and Corrosives.The report provides recommendations on the use of four in vitro test methods in a tiered-testing strategy, where positive substances can be classified as ocular corrosives or severe irritants. The four ocular toxicity test methods evaluated are (1) the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability [BCOP] test, (2) the Isolated Chicken Eye [ICE] test, (3) the Isolated Rabbit Eye [IRE] test, and (4) the Hens Egg Test Chorioallantoic Membrane [HET-CAM]. The report includes (a) ICCVAMs final test method recommendations on the use of these four in vitro test methods, (b) test method protocols for use, (c) recommended future optimization and validation studies, (d) reference substances for such studies, and (e) overall recommendations related to all four in vitro test methods.Keywords NICEATM/ICCVAM Five-Year Plan;CongressionalMandate;research;development; translation;validation of new and revised non-animal and other alternative assays;federal testing program;validation status of LLNA; town meeting;pyrogenicity peer review panel;botulinum toxins;ocular corrosives and severe irritants;6th World Congress on Animal Use in the Life Sciences;endocrine disruptor international validation study.

       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe were also of major public health importance. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus in toto. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the spring and summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because no human influenza isolates are available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. With our collaborator, Professor John S. Oxford, post-mortem records of fatal pneumonia cases from 1908-1928 were screened to identify putative influenza cases based on clinical history and post-mortem pathology findings. Promising cases were sectioned for subsequent molecular screening. Sections of post-mortem lung tissues are currently being examined for the presence of influenza A virus RNA fragments by RT-PCR methods previously used to characterize the 1918 pandemic virus from similar samples. 1. Determining the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus: Because the 1918 virus sequence was determined by designing degenerate, overlapping RT-PCR primer sets, the terminal segment sequences, reflecting the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) could not be determined using this method. In experimental pathogenesis experiments rescued influenza viruses containing 1918 gene segments have been chimeras with UTR sequences from the mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 H1N1 virus. It is possible that differences in the native 1918 virus may affect the results of pathogenesis studies. Thus, we have sought to use novel modifications of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methodologies to determine the native 1918 segment UTR sequences from the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 strain. Additionally, 7 of the coding sequences of the 1918 virus were previously determined from this strain, but the full-length HA sequence was only determined from A/South Carolina/1/1918. Thus, we also sought to complete the HA2 domain sequence of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 in addition to the UTRs to give a complete genomic sequence from one pandemic case. The HA2 sequence was completed and found to match the A/South Carolina/1/1918 sequence exactly.Using novel RACE approaches, the complete UTR sequences of the 1918 virus were determined. Several differences between 1918 and WSN33 have been observed in the UTRs of the gene segments. 2. Identification of pre-1918, and post-1918 influenza A virus cDNA-positive human pneumonia autopsy cases: Autopsy case records from the Royal London Hospital from 1907-1935 were screened for possible influenza pneumonia cases in collaboration with John Oxford, and the 20 most promising cases per year were sampled for molecular analysis. Additional 1918 autopsy cases from the AFIP were also screened. These efforts involve archevirologic surveys for pre-1918 human IAV RNA-positive autopsy cases to determine: 1) which subtype(s) of influenza A virus circulated in humans prior to the H1N1 pandemic in 1918; and 2) whether the 1918 pandemic virus retained any gene segment(s) from the previously circulating strain. Examination of post-1918 cases would allow study of the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses in the post-pandemic era before viral isolation in 1933, and allow characterization of virulence factors in the 1918 virus by comparison with less pathogenic but highly related viruses from the mid-1920s.Pre-1918 cases: Several pre-1918 cases were positive in an initial RT-PCR screen for the matrix gene, from 1910-1917, and three 1913 cases were RT-PCR positive after amplification with two degenerate H3 primer sets. Sequence analysis of these small fragments confirmed H3, but intriguingly, had no perfect matches in GenBank. Additional influenza RNA-positive cases from 1915-1917 have also been identified.1918 second wave cases: During an initial screening by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, an additional 26 second wave (fall wave) cases were screened by RT-PCR and 5 new positive cases were identified. Sequence analysis of the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene is being performed on these cases.Post-1918 cases: Several positive cases were identified from 1923, 1926, and 1927. Fragmentary sequence of the HA1 domain of a 1923 case demonstrated several coding differences with the 1918 virus.3. Re-evaluation of the cause of death in 1918 influenza cases: We performed a detailed histopathologic review of available 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic influenza autopsy cases from the archives of the AFIP. The histopathology of fatal influenza virus pneumonias strikingly shows that the spectrum of pathologic changes described in the 1918 influenza pandemic is not significantly different from the histopathology observed in other less lethal pandemics or even in deaths occurring during seasonal influenza outbreaks.We next examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that appeared in the pre-antibiotic era, the 1918 pandemic.  We examined lung tissue sections from 58 autopsies and reviewed pathologic and bacteriologic data from 118 published autopsy series describing in total 8,398 individual autopsy investigations. The 1918 influenza autopsies examined uniformly exhibited severe changes of secondary bacterial pneumonia.  Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series also clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities. Thus, the majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora.  Data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings.  If severe pandemic influenza is largely a problem of viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis, pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., influenza vaccines, antivirals).  Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonias, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high among pandemic planning priorities.',\n",
       " 'Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) is a significant cause of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. HPIV1 is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the subfamily Paramyxovirinae within the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes the HPIV2 and HPIV3 serotypes. These serotypes can be further classified as belonging to either the Respirovirus (HPIV1 and HPIV3) or Rubulavirus (HPIV2) genus and are immunologically distinct in that primary infection does not result in cross-neutralization or cross-protection. The HPIV1 genome encodes three nucleocapsid-associated proteins including the nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (P) and the large polymerase (L) and three envelope-associated proteins including the internal matrix protein (M) and the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the two viral neutralization antigens and are the major viral protective antigens. The HPIVs cause respiratory tract disease ranging from mild illness, including rhinitis, pharyngitis, and otitis media, to severe disease, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. HPIV1, HPIV2 and HPIV3 have been identified as the etiologic agents responsible for 6.0%, 3.3% and 11.5%, respectively, of hospitalizations of infants and young children for respiratory tract disease. Together these viruses account for approximately 20% of all pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory disease. A licensed vaccine is currently not available for any of the HPIVs.HPIV1 vaccine development:  We further sought to understand the role of the C proteins in HPIV1 replication in vitro and in vivo.  Recombinant HPIV1 (rHPIV1) was modified to create rHPIV1-P(C-), a virus in which expression of the C proteins (C&#8242;, C, Y1 and Y2) was silenced without affecting the amino acid sequence of the P protein.  Infectious rHPIV1-P(C-) was readily recovered from cDNA, indicating that the four C proteins were not essential for virus replication.  rHPIV1-P(C-) replicated in vitro as efficiently as HPIV1 wt early during infection, but its titer subsequently decreased coincident with the onset of an extensive cytopathic effect (cpe) not observed with rHPIV1 wt.  rHPIV1-P(C-) infection, but not rHPIV1 wt infection, resulted in activation of caspase 3 and caused nuclear fragmentation in LLC-MK2 cells, identifying the  HPIV1 C proteins as inhibitors of apoptosis.  In contrast to rHPIV1 wt, rHPIV1-P(C-) and rHPIV1-CF170S each induced IFN and did not inhibit IFN signaling in vitro.  However, only rHPIV1-P(C-) induced apoptosis.  Thus, the anti-IFN and anti-apoptosis activities of HPIV1 were separable: both activities are disabled in rHPIV1-P(C-) whereas only the anti-IFN activity is disabled in rHPIV1-CF170S.  In AGMs, rHPIV1-P(C-) was considerably more attenuated than rHPIV1-CF170S, suggesting that disabling the anti-IFN and anti-apoptotic activities of HPIV1 had additive effects on attenuation in vivo. Thus, the C proteins of HPIV1 are non-essential but have anti-IFN and anti-apoptosis activities required for virulence in primates.In an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), a useful tool for studying respiratory virus-host interactions, HPIV1 wt selectively infected ciliated cells within the HAE and progeny virus was released from the apical surface with little apparent gross cytopathology.  In HAE, type I IFN is induced following infection with rHPIV1-CF170S but not following infection with HPIV1 wt.  IFN induction coincided with a 100 to 1000-fold reduction in virus titer, supporting the hypothesis that the HPIV1 C proteins are critical for inhibition of the innate immune response.  A microarray-based analysis of the kinetics of gene expression of respiratory epithelial cells infected with wt or mutant HPIV1 or treated with IFN&#946; was performed to examine: 1) how wt HPIV1 infection alters human respiratory epithelial cell gene expression; 2) what role IFN&#946; plays in this response; 3) how the response to infection with the C mutant viruses, rHPIV1-CF170S and rHPIV1-P(C-), compares to infection with wt HPIV1; and 4) whether the phenotypic differences between the two C mutant viruses (level of attenuation and apoptosis phenotype) can be explained at the transcriptional level. mRNA levels in A549 cells treated with IFN&#946; or infected with HPIV1 wt, rHPIV1-CF170S, or rHPIV1-P(C-) were compared using a microarray that represented the full complement of known human genes. By 48 h post-infection, the CF170S mutant significantly induced 1,632 genes and suppressed 690 genes, whereas P(C-) induced 1,255 genes and suppressed 168 genes by 48 h p.i.  Wt HPIV1 significantly induced 274 genes and suppressed 3 genes, and IFN&#946; treatment induced 176 genes and suppressed 1 gene. Therefore, rHPIV1s encoding C gene mutations modify the expression of up to 2,322 genes, whereas HPIV1 encoding the wt C gene modifies the expression of only 277 genes, indicating the profound effect the C proteins have on suppression of the host cell response to HPIV1 infection. The gene expression profiles of rHPIV1-P(C-) and rHPIV1-CF170S infected cells did not differ. In summary, the HPIV1 C proteins exert remarkable control over the cellular transcriptional response to viral infection, indicating that the C proteins are important virulence factors for HPIV1.  Mutations within the C gene permit the activation of a broad array of cellular genes involved in the type I IFN, IRF3 and NF-kB pathways that would otherwise be repressed by HPIV1 infection, and these mutations specify an attenuation phenotype in vivo. HPIV2 vaccine development:  Reverse genetics was used previously to generate attenuating mutations in the L polymerase protein of human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) and to enhance their genetic stability.  Last year we described the construction of two highly attenuated viruses, rHPIV2-V94(15C)/460A948L and rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/&#916;1724, that were immunogenic and protective against challenge with wild-type HPIV2 in African green monkeys.  A clinical lot of rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/&#916;1724 has been manufactured and will be evaluated in humans in 2008 and 2009.The V gene of HPIV2, which has been described as an IFN antagonist promoting STAT2 degradation, is another target for the introduction of attenuating mutations.  Since the P and V ORFs in the P/V gene of HPIV2 overlap, we separated the P and V ORFs into two gene units to permit the introduction of genetically stable mutations into V without affecting P.  A HPIV2 P+V virus was recovered that had wt phenotype in vitro and in vivo.  The V protein contains a RING finger-like domain in its C terminal region that is involved in STAT2 degradation.  Mutations of the seven cysteine amino acid residues of the RING domain to serine were either lethal (could not be recovered) or highly debilitating, i.e., virus replication was over 1000-fold reduced in vitro, even in Vero cells that do not produce IFN.  This indicated that the V protein is required for efficient replication of HPIV2 in vitro and that the RING domain is not a useful site for the introduction of att mutations intended for use in HPIV2 vaccines.  We are seeking to identify mutations that modulate STAT2 degradation but that permit efficient replication in vitro.',\n",
       " 'H9N2 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: A Phase I study was initiated in 50 healthy adults who were admitted to an in-patient unit.  The vaccine was safe and well tolerated but the level of replication was low.  Although shedding of vaccine virus was minimal, 92% of seronegative participants had >4-fold rises in HI antibody titer and 79% had >4-fold rises in neutralizing antibody titer following two doses of vaccine; 100% had a response detected by at least one of these assays. Therefore, despite being highly restricted in replication, two doses of H9N2/AA ca vaccine were immunogenic in seronegative adults. H5N1 cold-adapted (ca) vaccines: Three candidate vaccines were developed based on H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997, 2003 and 2004. In each virus, the HA and NA genes were derived from wild-type H5N1 viruses. The HA in each case was modified to remove the multibasic amino acid cleavage site that is a virulence motif. A Phase I trial for safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of the 2004 H5N1 Vaccine based on the A/VietNam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus, was undertaken at a dose of 6.7 log10 TCID50 per dose in 20 healthy adults, aged 18-49 years. The clinical trial was conducted in an isolation unit.  Subjects received two doses of vaccine, administered 28 to 62 days apart, and were sequestered in an isolation unit 3 weeks following both doses. The level of replication, infectivity, and immunogenicity of the vaccine virus at this dose was low. Therefore, a study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, infectivity and immunogenicity of a moderately higher dose (7.5 log10 TCID50) of the same vaccine. Nineteen subjects received two doses of this dose. The vaccine was safe & well tolerated. Analysis of data from this study is in progress.\\tIn order to determine whether the finding of low infectivity and low immunogenicity observed with the 2004 H5N1 ca virus was unique to this strain, a Phase I study was undertaken with the 2003 H5N1 ca vaccine. Sixteen subjects received 2 doses of the 2003 H5N1 ca vaccine. The vaccine was safe & well tolerated. Analysis of data from this study is in progress.H7N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, a Phase I study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H7N3 ca vaccine based on A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 (H7N3). Seventeen subjects received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was safe and generally well tolerated. Analysis of data from this study is in progress.H2N2 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: H2N2 viruses caused the 1957 influenza pandemic and circulated in humans until 1968 when they were replaced by H3N2 viruses. Although H2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. An H2 vaccine is a high priority in preparing for a pandemic because H2 viruses have a proven capability for causing disease in humans and persons born after 1968 lack H2-specific immunity. Because the currently licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine utilized in the United States bears the internal protein genes of the influenza A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus, this virus was a logical first choice for evaluation as an H2 vaccine. However, this virus with the H2 HA and N2 NA has not been evaluated in seronegative people. An IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) virus. This study is in progress.H6N1 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H6N1 ca vaccine based on A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1). The study will be initiated in October 2008.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. A single polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and at least seven non-structural proteins. The genome organization of the DEN viruses is 5-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3 (UTR  untranslated region, C  capsid, prM  membrane precursor, E  envelope, NS  nonstructural). There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) that circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million dengue infections and hundreds of thousands of cases of the more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) with children bearing much of the disease burden. DEN viruses are endemic in at least 100 countries and cause more human disease than any other mosquito-borne virus. In at least eight Asian countries, the DEN viruses are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Unfortunately, many countries affected by DEN viruses have very limited financial resources for healthcare, and the economic burden of DEN disease is considerable. As such, an economical vaccine that prevents disease caused by the DEN viruses is a global public health priority. The cost-effectiveness, safety, long-term immunity, and efficacy associated with the live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus, serves as a model for the feasibility of a live attenuated DEN virus vaccine. However, the development of a live attenuated dengue vaccine has been complicated by several factors. First, it has been difficult to develop monovalent vaccines against each of the four serotypes that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Second, an effective live attenuated dengue virus vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation of components representing each serotype because multiple serotypes typically co-circulate in a region, each DEN serotype is capable of causing disease, and the introduction of additional serotypes is common. In addition, the association of increased disease severity (DHFDSS) in previously infected persons undergoing an infection by a different dengue serotype necessitates a vaccine that will confer long-term protection against all four serotypes. Third, it has been difficult to formulate a tetravalent vaccine with low reactogenicity that induces a broad neutralizing antibody response against each DEN serotype. Fourth, a dengue vaccine must confer protection against a wide range of genetically diverse subtypes that are dispersed around the world and can be readily introduced into a new region by international travel. Fifth, a dengue vaccine must be produced economically so that it can be made available to populations that need it most. We have tried to address these issues as part of a program to generate a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. To maximize the likelihood that suitable vaccine candidates would be identified, monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN1-4 were generated by two distinct recombinant methods and found to be attenuated and immunogenic in mouse and rhesus monkey models. In one method, deletion of 30 contiguous nucleotides from the 3 UTR of wild type cDNA clones of DEN1-4 was used to generate vaccine candidates. Specifically, the deletion of nucleotides 10478-10507 of the 3 UTR (del30) of recombinant wild type DEN4 yielded a vaccine candidate, rDEN4del30, which is safe, attenuated, and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and humans (9). Incorporation of the del30 mutation into infectious cDNA clones of DEN1, but not DEN2 or DEN3, at a site homologous to that in DEN4 attenuated these viruses for rhesus monkeys. Using a second method, antigenic chimeric viruses were generated by replacing wild type M and E structural genes of rDEN4del30 with those from DEN2 or DEN3, and the resulting chimeric viruses were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys.  The dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time.  The preclinical phase of this program is currently devoted largely to support the manufacture of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in volunteers. Multiple clinical lots of dengue 1-4 have been manufactured over the past year, focusing largely on the DEN3 vaccine candidates. Dengue serotype 1 vaccine developmentThe attenuation phenotype of rDEN1/4del30(ME) in SCID-HuH-7 mice, rhesus monkeys, and mosquitoes and the protective immunity observed in rhesus monkeys suggest that rDEN1/4del30(ME) should be considered for evaluation in a clinical trial.  Further research with this promising vaccine candidate is on hold pending outcome of ongoing clinical studies with the lead rDEN1del30 candidate that continues to look good in clinical trials.Dengue serotype 3 vaccine developmentThe dengue virus type 3 (DEN3) vaccine candidate, rDEN3del30, was previously found to be under-attenuated in both SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys and to have decreased infectivity for humans.  Herein, two strategies have been employed to generate attenuated rDEN3 vaccine candidates that retain the full complement of structural and nonstructural proteins of DEN3 and thus are able to induce humoral or cellular immunity to each of the DEN3 proteins.  First, using the predicted secondary structure of the DEN3 3 untranslated region (3-UTR), nine novel deletion mutant viruses were designed and found to be viable.  Four of nine deletion mutants replicated efficiently in Vero cells and were genetically stable.  Second, chimeric rDEN3 viruses were generated by replacement of the 3-UTR of the rDEN3 cDNA clone with that of rDEN4 or rDEN4del30 yielding the rDEN3-3D4 and rDEN3-3D4del30 viruses, respectively.  Immunization of rhesus monkeys with either of two deletion mutant viruses, rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN3del86, or with rDEN3-3D4del30 resulted in infection without detectable viremia, with each virus inducing a strong neutralizing antibody response capable of conferring protection from DEN3 challenge.  The rDEN3del30/31 virus showed a strong host range restriction phenotype with complete loss of replication in C6/36 mosquito cells despite robust replication in Vero cells.  In addition, rDEN3del30/31 had reduced replication in Toxorynchites mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation.  Clinical lots of the rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN3-3D4del30 have been manufactured, and INDs have been submitted or are about to be submitted.  Phase 1 clinical trials with each should begin within four months.An additional DEN3/4del30 vaccine candidate, in which the prM and E genes come from the Sri Lanka strain of DEN3 virus rather than the Slemens strain that had reduced infectivity for humans, has been generated and is being tested for infectivity and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys.  It is hoped that the clinically more prM and E genes from the more virulent Sri Lanka virus will enhance the infectivity of the virus for humans.',\n",
       " 'Pathogenesis of SARS in senescent mice: We investigated the response of the immune system to SARS-CoV infection in senescent BALB/c mice by flow cytometry and found that T cells undergo phenotypic and functional changes following encounter with viral antigen and migrate to the lungs, where they develop into a highly activated/effector population. In the spleen, the changes in T cells from naive to activated/effector cell profiles suggest a systemic virus-mediated T cell activation. Thus, upon viral antigenic stimulation, T cells differentiate and acquire the capacity to migrate from secondary lymphoid tissues and traffic to the sites of infection. We identified a biphasic pattern of expression of inflammatory mediators (cytokine, chemokine and receptor) at protein and mRNA levels in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected senescent BALB/c mice, and demonstrated that the local increase of these inflammatory mediators correlated with the migration and activation of inflammatory cells into the lungs.In collaboration with Michael Katze, University of Washington, we compared gene expression profiles from SARS-CoV-infected young mice that show minimal disease with those from SARS-CoV-infected aged mice that develop pneumonitis to define the extent to which the host response determined the outcome of infection. We identified differences in the pattern, magnitude and duration of the host response to SARS-CoV infection in the two groups of mice. In young mice, genes related to cellular development, cell growth and cell cycle were down-regulated during peak viral replication and these transcripts returned to basal levels as virus was cleared. In contrast, older mice had a greater number of elevated immune response and cell-to-cell signaling genes, and expression of many genes was sustained even after viral clearance, suggesting an exacerbated host response to virus. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV infected aged mice, a subset of genes was induced in a biphasic pattern that correlated with peak viral replication and a subsequent influx of lymphocytes and severe histopathologic changes in the lungs discussed above. The aged mice experiencing infection with SARS-CoV show an up-regulation of an abundance of host cellular genes in response to the virus but fail to bring this response under control even as the virus is cleared while young mice are able to clear SARS-CoV rapidly and show a controlled host response.  Evaluation of Strategies to Prevent SARS-CoV infections: \\tWe have collaborated with scientists at the NIH, at academic institutions and in industry to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a number of vaccines against SARS-CoV in animal models. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in animal models. The vaccine studies demonstrated three important findings: 1) the spike glycoprotein is the major protective antigen of SARS-CoV; 2) vaccines that express the spike glycoprotein induce neutralizing antibodies; and 3) vaccines that induce a neutralizing antibody response protect animals from replication of challenge virus. \\tOne of the concerns in the field of SARS research is the re-emergence of SARS-CoV or a related SARS-CoV-like virus. Masked palm civets were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV and horseshoe bats carry a SARS-CoV-like virus. If SARS were to reappear from an animal reservoir, it would be more likely to resemble the animal virus rather than the prototype SARS-CoV. However, few zoonotic strains of SARS-CoV have been isolated and maintained in cell culture and this presents a challenge in assessing the efficacy of candidate SARS vaccines against zoonotic strains. Ralph Baric (UNC) has applied synthetic biology and reverse genetics techniques to generate recombinant isogenic viruses bearing variant spike glycoproteins derived from animal sources.Immunoprophylaxis studies: \\tProphylactically administered monoclonal antibodies specific to the SARS spike protein and passive transfer of SARS-CoV hyper-immune sera to nave mice, hamsters and ferrets prevent or reduce SARS-CoV replication and associated disease following challenge. We demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies specific to the SARS spike protein administered therapeutically (i.e. after the onset of infection) prevent further increase in viral burden and reduce associated disease (e.g. consolidation) in hamsters. \\tWe participated in a large multi-center collaboration led by Dimiter Dimitrov from NCI, to demonstrate the ability of two human antibodies that bind to a region on the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein to cross-neutralize human and animal SARS-CoV isolates. Both antibodies potently cross-neutralized human and civet SARS-CoV strains in vitro. Mice that received either mAb were fully protected from infection with a human isolate of SARS-CoV and were partially protected from infection with a civet SARS-CoV-like virus. These antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity against isolates from the two SARS outbreaks in humans and isolates from palm civets, and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of SARS CoV infections. The ability of these human mAbs to neutralize zoonotic isolates is important because if SARS-CoV reappears in nature, it will likely result from re-introduction from an animal host.Vaccine studies:  Dr. Luis Enjuanes from Madrid generated a recombinant SARS coronavirus lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-E). The recombinant virus lacking the E gene (rSARS-CoV-E) grew in Vero E6, Huh-7 and CaCo-2 cells to titers 20, 200 and 200-fold lower than the recombinant wild-type virus, respectively, indicating that E protein was not essential for virus replication. The rSARS-CoV-E virus did not cause clinical illness in hamsters as measured by use of an activity wheel and replicated to titers 100 to 1000-fold lower than the recombinant wild-type virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters, and the lower viral load was accompanied by less inflammation in the lungs of hamsters infected with rSARS-CoV-E virus than with the recombinant wild-type virus. Based on these findings, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of this virus as a live attenuated vaccine. Hamsters immunized with rSARS-CoV-E developed high serum neutralizing antibody titers and were protected from replication of homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tract. rSARS-CoV-E -immunized hamsters remained active following wild-type virus challenge while mock-immunized hamsters displayed decreased activity. Widespread eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates described following challenge in mice vaccinated with an alphavirus expressing the SARS-CoV N protein were not prominent in hamsters vaccinated with the rSARS-CoV-E virus. Following challenge with homologous or heterologous virus, the lungs of mock-immunized hamsters had focal intense inflammatory infiltrates and viral antigen was present. However, hamsters immunized with rSARS-CoV-E or rSARS-CoV viruses showed only mild focal infiltrates in the lungs and viral antigen was not detected.  These results correlated with the activity of the hamsters and the quantitative virologic data. The ability of the rSARS-CoV-E vaccine to protect against challenge with the heterologous virus is significant because this virus strain is antigenically one of the most divergent strains from SARS-CoV Urbani; it clusters phylogenetically with the animal SARS-CoV isolates and was selected as a representative of an animal SARS-CoV because if SARS were to reemerge, it would likely come from an animal source. Thus, despite being attenuated in replication in the respiratory tract, rSARS-CoV-E virus has promise as a live attenuated vaccine.',\n",
       " 'The filarial parasite, Mansonella perstans (Mp), is endemic in central and West Africa with a geographic distribution that overlaps those of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), Loa loa, and Onchocerca volvulus. Despite microfilarial prevalences as high as 100% in some regions, little is known about the clinical manifestations of Mp infection. During an ultrasound survey of men coinfected with Mp and Wb in Sabougou, Mali, a surprisingly high prevalence of hydrocele was noted. Since Mp adults are generally found in serosal cavities, this raised the possibility that Mp infection was contributing to this pathology. To further investigate this association, ultrasound examinations were performed in 32 men with Mp monoinfection from the same villages as the original study and 23 normal controls living in Bamako. The prevalence of hydrocele (> 5 ml) was 5/32 (16%) as compared to 35/63 (56%) in men coinfected with Wb and Mp and 0/23 (0%) in normal controls. Other abnormal findings included lymphatic dilatation in 31/32 (97%), and testicular and/or scrotal calcifications in 8/32 (25%), as compared to 57/63 (90%) and 16/63 (25%) in coinfected patients. Although mild lymphatic dilatation was also noted in 13/23 (56%) of the normal controls, scrotal calcifications were not seen in this group. Interestingly, Mp microfilariae were detected in the hydrocele fluid of 2/15 patients with Mp infection who underwent hydrocelectomy and from whom fluid was examined at the time of the surgery. These findings suggest a heretofore unrecognized association between Mp infection and intra- and extra-testicular pathology.  The clinical and immunologic contributions of Mp infection are unknown, in part, because of the lack of response of Mp to standard antifilarial therapies.  The recent discovery of bacterial endosymbionts (Wolbachia) in most filarial species, including Mp (Keiser et al. 2008 Mol Biochem Parasitol), provides new therapeutic options for reducing microfilaremia.  In an open label, randomized trial, subjects with Mp microfilaremia with and without concomitant Wb infection were recruited from 4 villages in Mali and received doxycycline (200 mg daily for 6 weeks; n=106) or no treatment (n=110). At 6 months, Wb coinfected subjects were randomized further to receive a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (150 g/kg) or no treatment. Subjects were monitored daily during treatment for adverse events. The effects of drug treatment on Mp and Wb microfilarial levels were assessed at 6 and 12 months following the initiation of doxycycline therapy. Doxycycline was safe and effective at reducing Mp microfilaremia at 6 and 12 months.  Furthermore, at 12 months, 67/69 doxycycline-treated subjects had no detectable Mp microfilariae/60 l blood as compared to 10/63 untreated subjects.  Single dose albendazole and ivermectin provided no additional benefit to doxycycline in reducing Mp microfilaremia 6 months following their use. These results are consistent with previous findings that Mp harbors the intracellular endosymbiont, Wolbachia, and provide the first example of effective therapy for Mp infection. In Mali, infection with Wuchereria bancrofti and/or Mansonella perstans exists in several regions highly endemic for malaria, and co-infection is common. Pre-existing filarial infection and the resultant bias toward a modulated Type 1 immune response could alter the response to incoming malarial parasites, clearance of which is thought to depend on robust IFN and TNF responses. In turn, this could affect the clinical manifestations and outcome of malaria infection. To determine the effect of filarial infection on the prevalence and severity of malaria infection, 41 filaria-positive (FP) and 42 filaria-negative (FN) children and young adults (1-20 years of age) matched for age, gender and HbS/HbC status were followed weekly through the malaria transmission season (July-December 2007).  Anthelmintic treatment was administered to diminish the potential confounding effect of geohelminth infection. Clinical malaria was defined as signs and symptoms consistent with malaria infection in the presence of parasitemia. Baseline parameters were comparable between the groups.  There were no differences between the FP and FN subjects with respect to the incidence of malaria, the incidence of fever at presentation with malaria or the time to first malaria episode. However, parasitemia at the time of the first malaria episode was significantly higher in the FN group (926 parasites/mm3 vs. 353 parasites/ mm3 in the FP group, p=0.04). These findings suggest that filarial infection does not influence susceptibility to malaria infection but may lower the threshold for developing symptomatic infection. Analysis of symptom scores and cytokines during clinical malaria episodes is currently underway and should help elucidate the role of immune effectors in this process. To examine the chronic effects of pre-existent filarial infection on the immune response to malaria, filaria antigen- specific and malaria antigen-specific cytokine responses were examined in 20 FN and 19 FP individuals prior to the malaria transmission season. Of note, the Fil+ group mounted a markedly diminished IL-12p70, IFN-  and IP10  response following MalAg stimulation compared to the Fil- group but a significantly higher IL-10 response. Whereas, anti-TGF- had little effect, anti-IL10 antibodies induced a significant reversal of the MalAg specific downregulation of IL-12p70, IFN- , and IP10.  Blocking both IL-10 and TGF- together was no different than with IL-10 blockade alone. Taken together these data demonstrate that filarial infections clearly modulate the Pf-specific IL-12p70-IFN- axis known to be pivotal for resistance to malarial parasites and do so in an IL10-dependent manner.  Whether this Pf-specific Type 1 modulation extends to the level of CD4+ T cell frequencies of effector or regulatory cells is currently being evaluated in the same population.  Albendazole and ivermectin are currently used in combination for annual mass treatment of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) infection in Africa.  Although the drugs have been donated, the cost of such programs is very high and has proven to be a major impediment to the success of programs in countries with limited financial resources.  Data from albendazole treatment of other filarial infections and one study comparing single to multi-dose DEC/albendazole in Wb infection suggest that increased dose and/or frequency of albendazole dosing may be more effective in maintaining microfilarial clearance. Furthermore, the optimal dose of ivermectin for suppression of Wb microfilaremia is greater than that being used in the mass treatment program. To determine the effect of increased dose and frequency of albendazole/ivermectin (A/I) treatment on microfilarial clearance, 42 Wb microfilaremic residents of an endemic area in Mali, were randomized to receive two doses of standard annual A/I therapy (400 mg/150 mcg/kg; n=22) or four doses of biannual increased dose A/I therapy (800 mg/400 mcg/kg; n=20). Six months after the first dose of therapy, microfilarial clearance rates were comparable (16/22 (80%) in the annual standard dose group and 13/20 (65%) in the biannual high dose group). The one year evalaution is currently underway.',\n",
       " 'Dengue serotype 1 vaccine development: The live attenuated DEN1 vaccine candidate virus rDEN1del30 has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and was found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies are in progress to address the number and timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate. The studies involve two doses of vaccine given at an interval of 4 or 6 months. The results will be reported pending completion. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned.Dengue serotype 2 vaccine development: rDEN2/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine, rDEN4del30, have been replaced by those of the prototypic DEN2 NGC virus. The live attenuated DEN2 vaccine candidate virus rDEN2/4del30(ME) has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies are in progress to address the number and timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate. Studies involve two doses of vaccine given at an interval of 4 or 6 months.  Results will be reported pending completion. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned.Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development; rDEN3/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine rDEN430 have been replaced by those of a DEN3 wild type virus. rDEN3/4del30(ME) or placebo was evaluated at a dose of 1,000 or 100,000 PFU in 28 healthy dengue-naive adult volunteers per dose. Studies are in progress, but less than 40% of vaccinees were infected with either dose indicating this vaccine candidate is not sufficiently infectious to be used as a component of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Two additional DEN3 vaccine candidates have been generated for trials in humans in FY09.  Dengue serotype 4 vaccine development: rDEN4del30-200,201 is a live attenuated DENV-4 vaccine candidate specifically designed to further attenuate the rDEN4del30 parent virus. In a prior study, 5 of 20 vaccinees who received rDEN4del30 at 100,000 PFU developed moderately elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Mutational analysis of DENV-4 revealed that the 200,201 mutation in the NS5 polymerase specified greatly restricted virus replication in human hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cells. In pre-clinical animal studies, the rDEN4del30-200,201 vaccine candidate was shown to be more attenuated than rDEN4del30 in both SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys. We compared the frequency and severity of solicited adverse events and level of viremia between recipients of 100,000 PFU of rDEN4del30-200,201 and recipients of 100,000 PFU of rDEN4del30, administered in a previous vaccine trial. Most notably, no volunteers vaccinated with rDEN4del30-200,201 had detectable viremia compared with 70% of recipients of rDEN4&#8710;30, a finding similar to that observed in rhesus monkeys. rDEN4del30-200,201 induced a dengue-like rash in fewer volunteers than the parent vaccine rDEN4del30. In addition, no volunteer who received rDEN4del30-200,201 developed an ALT elevation above the upper limit of the laboratory normal compared with 25% volunteers who received rDEN4del30. rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 infected all vaccinees as evidenced by a 100% seroconversion rate. The decreased clinical signs and decreased replication confirmed that rDEN4del30-200,201 was more attenuated than its rDEN4del30 parent virus. The level of neutralizing antibody induced by rDEN4del30-200,201 at study day 42 was only slightly lower than that induced by rDEN4del30, a surprisingly insignificant trade-off considering the decreased reactogenicity. The abrogation of mild hepatotoxicity by the 200,201 mutation suggests that this mutation restricts replication of the vaccine in the liver of vaccine recipients. The restricted replication of rDEN4del30-200,201 in SCID HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys was also observed in humans, validating the pre-clinical approach of identifying a mutant virus with a decreased level of replication in human liver cells transplanted into SCID mice as a virus that is attenuated for humans. rDEN4del30-200,201 is a promising candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent DENV vaccine. We currently consider the rDEN4del30 vaccine our leading candidate for inclusion in the tetravalent vaccine for two reasons. At a proposed dose of 1000 PFU, it is economical to produce and has an acceptable safety profile; and, rDEN4del30 appears slightly more immunogenic in humans than rDEN4del30-200,201; this greater immunogenicity likely would translate into a more durable immunity. However, the present results with rDENdeldel30-200,201 are very encouraging because they identify a valuable backup vaccine candidate if rDEN4del30 has unanticipated adverse reaction upon further testing in humans and the results demonstrate that it is feasible to use genetic techniques to introduce defined mutations into the dengue virus genome to abrogate a specific adverse effect, in this instance, hepatotoxicity. A second candidate, rDEN4del30-4995, with decreased hepatotoxicity has also been made and evaluated in humans. These studies are in progress.Other dengue virus vaccine trials: Trials have been initiated to determine if infection with one dengue virus vaccine serotype modifies the replication and clinical response to a second serotype given after six months. This trial, in which four combinations of heterologous first and second vaccines are studied, has been initiated and largely enrolled.West Nile virus vaccine development  trials in humans: Phase I trials are ongoing with a live attenuated West Nile virus vaccine candidate, WNVDEN4del30. Studies at 1000 and 100,000 infectious units per vaccinee indicated the vaccine was safe with low viremia, but was immunogenic in only 80% of vaccinees. To achieve a higher take rate, two studies are ongoing in which two doses of 10,000 infectious units of WNVDEN4del30 are given six months apart to one group and 100,000 infectious units are given six months apart to second group.Tick-borne encephalitis virus vaccine development trials in humans: With the steady rise in tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infections in Europe, development of a live attenuated vaccine that will generate long-lasting immunity would be of considerable benefit. A chimeric flavivirus, designated LGT/DEN4, was previously constructed to have a genome containing the prM and E protein genes of Langat virus (LGT), a naturally attenuated member of the TBEV complex, and the remaining genetic sequences derived from DEN4. LGT/DEN4 was highly attenuated in rodents and non-human primates and clinical trials in humans were initiated. Twenty-eight healthy seronegative adult volunteers were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive 1000 PFU of LGT/DEN4 or placebo. LGT/DEN4 vaccine was safe and viremia was seen in only one vaccinee. Infection induced a neutralizing antibody response to wild-type LGT in 80% of volunteers with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 1:63 present on day 42 post-immunization; but the antibody response against TBEV was much less frequent (35%) and lower in magnitude (GMT = 1:9). To assess the response to a booster dose, 21 of the original 28 volunteers were re-randomized to receive a second dose of either 1000 PFU of vaccine or placebo given 6 to 18 months after the first dose. The immunogenicity against either LGT or TBEV was not significantly enhanced after the second dose of vaccine. Thus, chimerization of LGT with DEN4 yielded a vaccine virus that was highly attenuated yet infectious in humans. The level of replication was sufficiently r',\n",
       " 'A vaccine against Marburg virus would be highly significant in preventing outbreaks which are both naturally occurring or the result of bioterrorist activity.   To develop a safe and effective vaccine against the Marburg virus. Ebola and Marburg viruses have been identified as the cause of several highly lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever for which there is no effective treatment or cure. Therefore, vaccine studies are critically important for protection against infection. We developed a highly effective vaccine strategy for Ebola virus infection in non-human primates. A combination of primary immunization with plasmid DNA and boosting with adenoviral vectors containing Ebola genes generated protective immunity in cynomolgus macaques. The vaccine yielded 100% protective efficacy against Ebola infection and showed for the first time that protective immune responses could be generated in primates. The DNA vaccine is currently being tested in Phase I human clinical trials conducted by the VRC Clinical Trials Core Laboratory. In addition to our DNA prime/adenoviral vector boost vaccine studies, our laboratory has demonstrated that protective immunity to Ebola can be generated with a single inoculation of adenoviral vector vaccine 2, a result with significant implications for conducting enhanced ring vaccination during an Ebola outbreak.  We have applied a similar strategy to the development of protective vaccines against Marburg virus.',\n",
       " 'Flaviviruses are a group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a global impact due to their widespread distribution and ability to cause disease in humans and economically important domesticated animals. Several members of this genus, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are considered emerging or re-emerging pathogens because the incidence with which they encounter humans and cause disease is increasing each year at an alarming rate. There are more than 50 million humans infected by flaviviruses each year.WNV is a mosquito-borne member of this genus and is the etiologic agent of West Nile encephalitis. WNV is endemic in parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and has been responsible for periodic outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and horses. The introduction of WNV into North America in 1999 and its rapid spread across the United States into Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean identifies this virus as an emerging pathogen of clinical and economic significance for the Western Hemisphere. While seroprevalence studies indicate that most WNV infections of humans are subclinical, clinically apparent infections range from a febrile illness (West Nile fever) to more severe and potentially fatal neurologic disease. Currently, no WNV vaccine has been approved for use in humans and treatment is supportive.Cryo-electron microscopy studies reveal that the surface of flavivirus virions is covered by a highly ordered icosahedron composed of 180 envelope proteins. The generation of antibodies capable of binding to this array of viral proteins and blocking infection is a critical aspect of the immune response and an important goal of vaccine development. Passive immunization studies and experimental infections of immunodeficient mice demonstrate that antibody plays a significant role in protection from flavivirus infection. The importance of antibodies in vivo reflects their ability to directly neutralize virus infectivity, facilitate complement-mediated lysis of virions, and promote efficient viral clearance through Fc-receptor dependent pathways. However, antibodies generated in response to natural infection or vaccination also have the potential to enhance virus infection both in vitro and in vivo.The neutralization potential of an antibody is governed by the number of sites on the virion available for binding (determined by epitope accessibility) and the strength of binding (antibody affinity/avidity). Using neutralizing antibodies that bind structurally distinct sites on the WNV or DENV virion, we are investigating the biochemical basis of potency with respect to how antibodies engage virus particles, and in what numbers. Our recent data suggest that neutralization of WNV requires engagement of individual virions with a stoichiometry that exceeds a required threshold. Our estimate for this threshold is roughly 30 antibodies.Due to the quasi-icosahedral symmetry of the mature virion, not all epitopes on the flavivirus are equally accessible for antibody binding. Accessibility modulates antibody potency, as some determinants may not be exposed with a frequency that permits neutralization. Thus, antibodies that recognize such epitopes may neutralize poorly, or not at all, even at concentrations that permit saturation because too few antibodies can simultaneously dock on the virion. Paradoxically, many antibodies that recognize poorly exposed epitopes on the mature virion still show neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo. How antibodies engage cryptic epitopes on virions with a stoichiometry that permits neutralization is difficult to reconcile using existing static models of virion structure and envelope organization. To investigate mechanisms that govern the potency of antibodies that target cryptic epitopes, we are investigating the dynamics that control epitope accessibility and neutralization potency.Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of DHF cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. At birth, DENV-specific passively acquired antibodies are present at a relatively high concentration and exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro. However, as the child ages, degradation of maternally acquired antibody continues to levels that are no longer protective, do not neutralize virus, and enhance virus infection in vitro. The waning antibody titers of infants to levels that support ADE in vitro parallels the risk of DHF following primary DENV infection during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE. To facilitate this goal, our laboratory is investigating the biochemical determinants that comprise the enhancing character of an antibody, and studying the cell biology that underlies the mechanism of ADE.',\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from Medimmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype, including H5N1 viruses that have caused human infections since 2003, as well as H6 and H7 viruses. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, clinical lots of H5N1 and H7N3 ca vaccines were generated and Phase I clinical trials of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccines for healthy adults were undertaken under an IND. \\tAn H6 influenza virus was identified as a potential progenitor of the H5N1 viruses that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 because the two viruses shared high sequence homology in 7 gene segments. This virus continues to circulate in the bird population in Asia, and other H6 viruses are prevalent in birds in North America and Asia. H6 was the most abundantly detected influenza virus subtype in wild birds from Europe and the Americas. The prevalence of H6 viruses in aquatic and terrestrial birds increases the potential for transmission to humans and therefore this subtype may pose a pandemic risk.  \\tWe evaluated the antigenic and genetic relatedness of 14 H6 influenza viruses, and their ability to replicate and induce a cross-reactive immune response in mice and ferrets.  The H6 viruses replicated to different levels in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets, causing varying degrees of morbidity and mortality in these two models demonstrating that mammals can be productively infected with H6 viruses. Eleven of the 14 viruses replicated in the lungs and 10 replicated in the NT of mice without prior adaptation. Five viruses that replicated to varying levels in mice were evaluated in ferrets and 4 of them replicated in the respiratory tract of ferrets. Viruses that replicated to moderate to high titers in the lungs induced high neutralizing antibody titers in the sera. Neutralizing antibody titers detected in the sera of ferrets generally correlated with those in mice, but in neither model did the immunogenicity correlate fully with the ability of the viruses to replicate in the respiratory tract. The H6 viruses elicited poorly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies in ferrets. Based on the genetic analysis and antigenic cross-reactivity of post-infection sera of mice and ferrets infected with H6 viruses isolated from different continents, three H6 viruses, A/duck/Hong Kong/182/77 (H6N9), A/mallard/Alberta/89/85 (H6N2) and A/teal/HK/W312/97 (H6N1), were selected for vaccine development. We generated three live attenuated H6 vaccine candidates that contained the HA and NA gene segments from the wt H6 viruses and the six internal protein gene segments from the AA ca vaccine donor virus. All three H6 vaccine candidates exhibited phenotypic properties of ts, ca and att conferred by the internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. Intranasal administration of a single dose of the three H6 ca vaccine viruses induced neutralizing antibody in mice and ferrets. A single dose of each H6 ca vaccine conferred significant protection from replication of homologous wt virus in the respiratory tract in mice and ferrets; protection from heterologous virus challenge was variable. The A/teal/HK/W312/97 ca virus provided the broadest cross-protection against challenge with three antigenically distinct H6 wt viruses. These findings provide support for clinical evaluation of this H6 ca vaccine virus. An IND application for the phase I evaluation of this vaccine was approved by the FDA and a clinical trial is planned.\\tIn addition to the development and evaluation of vaccines against avian influenza viruses, we have investigated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of human monoclonal antibodies against H5N1 influenza. In collaboration with investigators from Vietnam and Switzerland, we generated neutralizing anti-H5N1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tested their efficacy for prophylaxis and therapy in a murine model of infection. In vivo, the mAbs conferred protection from lethality in mice challenged with A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1) in a dose-dependent manner. mAb prophylaxis provided a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary virus titer, reduced associated inflammation in the lungs, and restricted extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus. Therapeutic doses of 3 mAbs provided robust protection from lethality at least up to 72 h post-infection with A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1) and were also therapeutically active in vivo against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1), a virus that belongs to a different genetic clade. These studies provide proof of concept that fully human mAbs with neutralizing activity can be rapidly generated from the peripheral blood of convalescent patients and that these mAbs are effective for the prevention and treatment of H5N1 infection in a mouse model. A panel of neutralizing, cross-reactive mAbs might be useful for prophylaxis or adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza. We are actively involved in mapping the epitopes recognized by these and additional mAbs.',\n",
       " 'We have used the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to sensitize human tumor cell lines to       apoptosis mediated by death ligands, in particular the protein TRAIL. Also we have performed       studies with antibodies that act as agonists to the TRAIL death receptors. The agonist       antibodies may offer specific advantages for cancer therapy. There are 4 well-defined TRAIL       receptors in humans, yet only 2 of them death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5) send       the apoptotic death signal. Therefore specific agonist antibodies to these receptors may be       more selective than the TRAIL protein itself that can bind to all of the receptors. In       addition antibodies tend to have a much longer half-life that the TRAIL protein in vivo, so       their effects may be more potent and longer lasting. Bortezomib, a novel anticancer agent that       inhibits the proteasome complex of enzymes recently was approved by the FDA for the therapy of       multiple myeloma as a single agent. We have shown that in a panel of 50 human tumor cell       lines, bortezomib sensitized about 45% of these cells to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL, about       25% to the apoptotic effects of Fas Ligand and less than 7 % to apoptosis by TNF. Since this       proteasome inhibitor was very efficient in sensitizing tumor cells to TRAIL we studied this       sensitization in more detail. In mouse models of renal cancer and breast cancer we showed that       agonist antibodies to the mouse TRAIL death receptor DR5 had significantly enhanced       pro-apoptotic activity in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. More       importantly, this combination of agents had an improved therapeutic effect over either agent       alone in experimental lung metastases models of both the renal and breast carcinomas in vivo.       In addition the therapeutic combination did not cause any obvious toxicity in the mice on       examination of a large number of organs. This was the first demonstration, to our knowledge,       that this combination could have therapeutic anticancer efficacy in vivo in the absence of       significant toxicity. There are currently clinical trails in progress using bortezomib and       agonist antibodies to the TRAIL death receptor 4 in patients with multiple myeloma. We       investigated the molecular basis of this sensitization in more detail. Cell death by apoptosis       in response to the death ligands can proceed by 2 pathways. These are the extrinsic pathway,       where the signaling from the death ligand death receptors is strong and directly signals cell       death by setting off a cascade of enzymes. Alternatively for the intrinsic pathway, signaling       from the death receptors is weaker and subsequent damage to the mitochondria of the cell is       necessary for the cell death to occur. Using human renal carcinoma cells that are either       sensitized or resistant to the effects of bortezomib on TRAIL-driven apoptosis, we concluded       that the major effects of bortzomib were on amplifying the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.       However exactly how a proteasome inhibitor amplifies this signaling at the molecular level is       unclear and is under further investigation. In collaboration with the Molecular Targeting       Development Program (MTDP) of the NCI we have also established a high-throughput screen to       identify novel agents that can sensitize human cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Over       18,000 pure synthetic compounds or natural products were screened and 18 compounds were       identified for further study, 14 pure products and 4 synthetic compounds. Six of the compounds       have been studied in more detail. None are proteasome inhibitors, but most may be DNA-damaging       agents. Studies on these compounds, and the high-throughput testing of purified compounds from       a wide variety of various extracts that the MTDP possesses are currently underway.We have used the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to sensitize human tumor cell lines to       apoptosis mediated by death ligands, in particular the protein TRAIL.

       " 'Diarrheal diseases consistently rank as one of the top ten causes of death from all causes worldwide and are estimated to account for almost two million deaths. The major impact of diarrheal diseases occurs in children under five years of age who suffer approximately 18% (about 2 million) of 10.6 million deaths in this age group annually, with the greatest toll in the developing countries. Rotaviruses (RVs) have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries accounting for approximately 500,000 deaths in the under five year age group, mostly in developing countries. RVs are uniquely egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions. Therefore, the urgency for a RV vaccine for use in both developed and developing countries has been a very high public health priority. We developed an oral, live, attenuated RV vaccine in a quadrivalent formulation to protect against the four epidemiologically important serotypes, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Although the relative importance of homotypic vs. heterotypic immunity was not established with certainty, it appeared that serotype-specific immunity was a major component of protection against RV illness. The vaccine was comprised of representatives of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus rotavirus (RRV), a VP7 serotype 3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and three human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing ten RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype 1, 2, or 4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the candidate vaccines safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease,  the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Subsequently, in August, 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV)) to Wyeth Laboratories. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception. Following additional CDC investigations, in October 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported the vaccines link with intussusception notably in the first two weeks after administration and predominantly after the first dose. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Laboratories withdrew the vaccine from the market. The fate of this vaccine continues to generate national and international interest and controversy. Later data demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor regarding the link with intussusception. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to intussusception (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately to the number of cases. In addition, there are lingering questions regarding the vaccines actual attributable risk of intussusception, a risk estimate that has ranged widely depending on the study.  Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 epidemiologically-important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study of Finnish infants and young children, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule,the BRV-TV and RRV-TV induced a high level of protection (90% or greater) against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, the analysis of another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH collaborative study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in three different schedules, approximately 0-2-4, 0-4-6 or 2-4-6 months of age,showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition,the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at two months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company, for the NIH-developed technology for RotaShield (RRV-TV). This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially. However, efforts to implement our second generation vaccine, BRV-TV, for the developing countries predominantly, have advanced. The NIH OTT has granted licenses to develop and commercialize the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions, one in the U.S. and seven in developing countries (Brazil, China and India). As of 2008, there is encouraging progress as vaccine production has reached the point that 3 companies are planning phase I studies for the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Our laboratory continues to serve as the unofficial reference laboratory for this program. We are proposing that (i) the second generation RV vaccine be comprised of 6 serotypes (G1-4, 8 and 9) as a universal vaccine or as a specifically designed vaccine for different areas of the world (i.e. tetravalent G1-4, pentavalent G1-4,9 or hexavalent G1-4,8,9), (ii) that it should be given in a two-dose schedule at 0-4 and 4-8 weeks of age, which is a relatively refractory period for intussusception under natural conditions. The proposed manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its availability at a low cost, which would facilitate its implementation in these developing areas of the world. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world was given an unanticipated, unsolicited boost, when we were notified in October 2006 by PATH that the Gates Foundation had approved their application with funding  ...at a level of Approx $17 million over five years to support the process and clinical development of the NIH bovine rotavirus vaccine through Phase 2 at two selected manufacturers; and address product development challenges relevant to all emerging manufacturers of this vaccine.  This PATH-NIH-licensee effort has been very fruitful as PATH is providing an enabling platform  to facilitate the vaccine develpment process. In 2008, progress has been made with RotaShield as the license granted by NIH to BIOVIRx, has been transferred to a Foundation which is funding its development at a company in Germany. The vaccine is being developed currently in preparation for a placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trial in 2 African countries with two doses of vaccine, the first during the neonatal period and the second about three weeks later. This will commence in early 2009. Our laboratory has been participating in the planning phase of this trial and is also engaged in collaborative activities with the vaccine manufacturer.',\n",
       " 'In the cancer immunotherapy arena, we solved a major paradox in the role of natural       killer T cells (NKT cells) in tumor immunosurveillance, as NKT cells have been reported by       others to protect, and by us to suppress tumor immunosurveillance. Type I NKT cells (carrying       the invariant Va14Ja18 T cell receptor) contribute to tumor immunity, whereas type II NKT       cells (with diverse receptors) are sufficient to suppress tumor immunosurveillance. We showed       that the type II NKT cell is the main cell suppressing immunosurveillance in 4 tumor models in       which the classic CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cell does not play a role. Importantly, we discovered       that protective type I NKT cells and suppressive type II NKT cells cross-regulate each other,       defining a new immunoregulatory axis between these polar opposites. The balance between these       2 cell types may determine the immune response to tumors. Blockade of interleukin-13 (IL-13),       a mediator of type II NKT cells, also delayed cancers, even in Her-2/neu transgenic mice. We       discovered that blockade of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibits tumor growth by       blocking synergy between IL-13 and TNFalpha to induce transforming growth factor-beta       (TGF-beta) production. We also found that blockade of the downstream mediator of this NKT       regulatory pathway, TGF-beta, can synergize with anti-cancer vaccines in mice, increase the T       cell response, and more completely inhibit growth of an established tumor (cervical cancer       model) than the vaccine alone. The protection is CD8 T cell-dependent. We have completed a       phase I clinical trial of a human anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody in melanoma patients as       part of a CRADA with Genzyme Corp. and a phase II trial is planned. The intent is to use this       agent in conjunction with a cancer vaccine. We also found that a recombinant adenovirus       expressing Her-2 can prevent appearance of spontaneous autochthonous breast cancers in       BALB-neuT Her-2 transgenic mice. The mechanism is antibody mediated and requires CD4 T cells       only for help, and does not require CD8 cells. However, the protection is not FcR dependent,       unlike that of Herceptin. The antibody induced by the vaccine blocks phosphorylation of Her-2       and downmodulates this oncoprotein, rather than initiating killing by antibody-dependent       cellular cytotoxicity. It inhibits tumor growth in vitro in the absence of other cells. This       vaccine works therapeutically to cure large (larger than  1 cm) established Her-2 positive tumors       and large established lung metastases in mice. This vaccine may be more effective for breast       cancer than the monoclonal Herceptin, because the patient would make her own antibodies rather       than needing repeated costly infusions and these would not be dependent on FcR-mediated       mechanisms. The polyclonal antibodies elicited may be more resistant to escape mutation than a       monoclonal. We are making an adenovirus expressing the corresponding domains of human Her-2 in       preparation for a clinical trial in human breast cancer, and have had pre-investigational new       drug discussions with the FDA. We have mapped a new epitope presented by HLA-B7 from the       PAX-FKHR fusion protein that is unique to and expressed by 85% of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma       tumors. Also, we have mapped HLA-A2-restricted epitopes from 4 new cancer antigens in       collaboration with Ira Pastan (Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, CCR), all expressed in       prostate cancer but several also expressed in breast cancer and some other tumors. We have       modified the sequences of these antigens by epitope enhancement to make them more immunogenic,       and have shown killing of human tumor cells by T cells specific for the first two of these       agents. The first of these to be developed, TARP, will be used in a clinical trial of prostate       cancer patients. In the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral vaccine arena, in studies       also applicable to cancer, we found that interleukin-15-(IL-15) expression by a vaccine leads       to induction of higher avidity cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that more effectively clear       virus infections (or kill tumor cells). We also found that IL-15 overcomes the lack of CD4 T       cell help in CD4-deficient animals, allowing induction of long-lived memory CTL that would not       be induced otherwise. This may be a critical finding for therapeutic HIV and cancer vaccines,       because it will be necessary to immunize patients without assistance from CD4 T cells. Indeed,       IL-15 prevented the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced death of CD8 T cells       in the absence of CD4 help, and was necessary as well as sufficient for help, implying that       induction of IL-15 production by dendritic cells is an important mechanism of T cell help. The       vaccinia-IL-15 was also a more effective smallpox vaccine than a control vaccinia. IL-15 also       induced novel CD8aa T cells distinct from intestinal epithelial lymphocytes. Further, we found       that CD8 T cell avidity was a major factor in determining which antigen epitopes were       immunodominant, more so than the level of epitope expression. We also enhanced HIV helper and       CTL epitopes presented by human class II and class I HLA molecules, to improve HIV vaccine       constructs. Using one of these epitopes with the anti-retroviral drug lamivudine (3TC), we       developed a vaccine that provides CTL-mediated counter-selective pressure against       drug-resistant mutants of HIV. This approach is now being tested in a clinical trial in       collaboration with Bob Yarchoan (HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch, CCR). We also showed that the       TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotides could enhance the efficacy of a live viral vector vaccine,       modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), thereby reducing the dose needed to protect and induce       protective CD8 CTL. Strikingly, the CpG oligos used with the MVA also allowed induction of CTL       and protection in CD4-deficient mice. This may be another approach to a therapeutic vaccine       for CD4-deficient patients infected with HIV. Further, we showed in mouse and macaque studies       that clearance of virus from gut mucosal tissues, where HIV predominantly replicates, is       dependent on high avidity CTL in the local gut mucosa. Protection correlates with high avidity       but not low avidity CTL in the gut mucosa, and not with CTL in the peripheral blood. Because       the gut mucosa is a major reservoir for HIV replication, inducing mucosal high avidity CTL to       eradicate this reservoir may be critical to keeping HIV under control. We found, in both mice       and macaques, that local mucosal immunization induces higher avidity CTL than immunization at       more distant sites, and that CTL avidity is correlated with proximity to the site of       vaccination, whether mucosal or systemic. We also showed, in macaques, that it is possible for       a mucosal AIDS vaccine to induce sufficient CTL in the mucosa to significantly delay       dissemination of virus to the bloodstream and beyond. Although this vaccine did not completely       prevent transmission, the delay indicates that a substantial fraction of the virus was       eradicated at the initial mucosal site of infection. An improved version of this approach may       be able to eradicate the initial nidus of infection and thus abort the AIDS infection before       it becomes established. To improve this vaccine, we are studying other TLR ligands as mucosal       vaccine adjuvants, and have found a synergistic tr [summary truncated at 7800 characters]',\n",
       " 'Paramyxoviruses infect the respiratory tract and induce a high level of local and systemic immunity. Reverse genetics systems for producing recombinant viruses have been developed in our laboratory and by collaborators, providing the means for introducing foreign genes to create vectored vaccines. This type of virus has a negligible incidence of recombination, obviating concerns of genetic exchange with circulating viruses. The respiratory tropism provides for direct immunization of the respiratory tract, an advantage against pathogens that use the respiratory tract as a portal for entry and egress. The particular paramyxoviruses that we are evaluating replicate in the superficial cells of the respiratory tract and do not spread significantly beyond that site, reducing concerns about infection of distal tissues.  Thus, paramyxoviruses have distinct advantages as vaccine vectors for expressing protective antigens of highly pathogenic agents. We have been evaluating HPIV3 as a human viral model, and avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a non-human viral model. We previously used a derivative of HPIV3 as a vector to express the structural proteins of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This identified the spike S glycoprotein as the only significant neutralization and protective antigen among the SARS structural proteins. A PIV3-vectored vaccine expressing S was immunogenic and protective against SARS-CoV in African green monkeys.We also previously evaluated HPIV3 as a vector to express the single glycoprotein GP of Ebola virus (EBOV). Guinea pigs infected with a single intranasal inoculation of HPIV3/EboGP developed a strong serum antibody response and were completely protected against disease associated with challenge with an otherwise highly lethal intraperitoneal injection of EBOV. A single inoculation of the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys was moderately immunogenic against EBOV and protected 88% of the animals against severe hemorrhagic fever and death caused by EBOV challenge. Two doses were highly immunogenic and all of the animals were free of disease signs and detectable EBOV challenge virus.The vaccines described above are candidates for further evaluation as pediatric vaccines. However, it was unclear whether they would be effective in adults because the high seroprevalence against HPIV3 in that population might restrict the replication and immunogenicity of an HPIV3 vector. To evaluate this possibility, guinea pigs were infected with HPIV3 and, 40 days later, were immunized by infection with HPIV3/EboGP. Replication of HPIV3/EboGP was not detected in any of the animals, indicating that immunity to HPIV3 indeed strongly restricted the replication of the vector. Surprisingly, however, the immune response to EBOV GP was almost equivalent to that achieved in control animals that had not been previously infected with HPIV3. Thus, it may be possible to achieve immunization in HPIV3-immune animals. We are presently evaluating the immunogenicity of this vaccine in HPIV3-seropositive primates.Next, we deleted the F and HN genes from HPIV3 and replaced them with EBOV GP to create a virus, HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP, in which GP would be the sole viral transmembrane surface protein. This virus was attenuated in vitro but reached titers comparable to those of HPIV3. Electron microscopy showed that the shape and dimensions of the HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP particle resembled those of HPIV3 (and HPIV3/EboGP) but the envelope thickness and spike appearance resembled those of EBOV. In an in vitro model of the human epithelium, HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP was highly attenuated and displayed the apical infection phenotype of HPIV3 and did not spread beyond the superficial cell layer. Following intranasal infection of guinea pigs, HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP was highly attenuated and completely restricted to the respiratory tract but nonetheless was highly immunogenic. A single intranasal dose provided complete protection of guinea pigs against an otherwise lethal challenge of guinea pig-adapted EBOV, such that there were no disease signs or evidence of challenge virus replication. Since HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP lacks the two neutralization antigens of HPIV3, it should be even less sensitive to pre-existing HPIV3-specific immunity than HPIV3/EboGP. We confirmed that the virus was insensitive to neutralization by HPIV3-specific antibodies in vitro. In addition, there was no significant difference in its immunogenicity in guinea pigs that were HPIV3-nave versus HPIV3-experienced. Thus, HPIV3/&#8710;F-HN/EboGP provides an alternative to HPIV3/EboGP, one that is very highly attenuated, is insensitive to HPIV3-neutralizing antibodies, and nonetheless is nearly as immunogenic. A second strategy to overcome seroprevalence is to use an animal virus that does not usually infect humans and is antigenically distinct from common human viruses. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian paramyxovirus (comprising serotype 1) that fits these criteria. A non-human virus has the potential to be naturally attenuated in primates due to host range restriction, and this indeed appears to be the case with NDV. There is serological evidence that bird handlers can be infected, but infection apparently does not cause significant disease. We confirmed that NDV is very highly attenuated following inoculation of the respiratory tract of rhesus and African green monkeys. NDV exists naturally in a variety of strains that exhibit a wide spectrum of virulence in birds, ranging from highly virulent (velogenic), to moderate virulence (mesogenic), to low virulence (lentigenic). We have compared vectors based on lentigenic, mesogenic, and composite NDV strains and have found little difference in attenuation in primates, suggesting that the pathotype distinctions that are so prominent in birds are overshadowed in primates by the strong host range restriction. Despite the high level of attenuation, which would be predictive of a high level of vaccine safety,  the expressed foreign proteins are moderately-to-highly immunogenic. For example, an NDV vector was constructed to express the SARS-CoV S protein. African green monkeys immunized via the respiratory tract with two doses of the vaccine developed a titer of SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies comparable to the robust secondary response observed in animals that have been immunized with a different experimental SARS-CoV vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV. When animals immunized with NDV-S were challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV, direct viral assay of lung tissues taken by necropsy at the peak of viral replication demonstrated a 236-1,102 fold mean reduction in pulmonary SARS-CoV titer compared to control animals.Another NDV was engineered to express the hemagglutinin HA glycoprotein of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus (HPAIV) (NDV-HA). The NDV-HA virus was highly attenuated in African green monkeys as well as in chickens. In African green monkeys, two doses of NDV-HA induced a titer of HPAIV-neutralizing serum antibodies that, based on historic controls, would be consistent with substantial protection against morbidity and mortality caused by H5N1 HPAIV. Moreover, a substantial respiratory mucosal immunoglobulin A response was induced following one and two doses, which would be particularly important in controlling a respiratory pathogen. NDV has potential for further development as a highly attenuated vaccine vector for use in humans against highly pathogenic agents.We have initiated antigenic and sequence analysis of serotypes 2-9 of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) as a prelude to their evaluation for attenuation and safety in non-human primates as potential vectors. Complete sequences have been determined for representatives of APMV2 and APMV3.',\n",
       " 'Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 170 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), there are 4.1 million persons who are anti-HCV positive, 3.2 million of whom have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2001, chronic liver disease was the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection is poorly understood. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infections results in sustained eradication of the virus in 54% to 56% of persons. It is evident that a large number of persons do not respond to therapy. The current state of therapy is inadequate, expensive, and cannot be applied to a substantial proportion of affected individuals due to problematic side effects. Therapeutic options for non-responder patients and persons who do not qualify for interferon-based regimens are limited. Thus newer, safer and more effective therapies are urgently needed for chronic HCV infection.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have created a large database of untreated patients with chronic HCV (n700) and have analyzed this database to identify factors that affect the natural history of chronic HCV infection. Using this database, we have already reported on rates of fibrosis progression in untreated patients with chronic HCV infection and that hepatic steatosis does not appear to be a risk factor for progression of fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. More recently, the database was used to search for candidate genes that were associated with fibrosis progression using a genetic haplotype approach. Mx1-CAGT and PKR-TGATT haplotypes were independently associated with less severe hepatic fibrosis (defined as Ishak fibrosis stage &#8804;3).To further define factors associated with fibrosis progression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C, we have analyzed a large, well characterized cohort of over 1000 patients participating in a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of long-term peginterferon versus no therapy for patients with advanced HCV infection (HALT-C-see below). This analysis revealed that higher AST/ALT ratio and total serum bilirubin and lower serum albumin and platelet count were associated with a higher likelihood of developing a clinical outcome in patients with Ishak stage &#8805;3 fibrosis over a period of 3.8 years.Finally, we are validating the usefulness of a new technology, ultrasound elastography (Fibroscan), to non-invasively assess hepatic fibrosis. Results of the Fibroscan will be compared to liver biopsy, MRI elastography and plasma will be stored for future proteomic analysis. Our goal is to develop a series of blood and imaging test that will obviate the need for liver biopsy in most patients with chronic HCV infection.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Though therapy of chronic HCV infection has improved over the last decade, it remains sub-optimal. Recent studies suggest that monitoring viral kinetics can be used to tailor therapy for individual patients. Response to early viral kinetics can be used to shorten the course of therapy and to discontinue therapy early in patients who are unlikely to respond. In study 02-DK-0065, we are examining the effect of two different regimens of pegylated interferon alfa 2a plus ribavirin compared to the standard regimen on viral kinetics in patients with chronic HCV infection. We are studying the effect of ribavirin only as well as twice weekly versus once weekly dosing of peginterferon alfa-2a on viral kinetics. In addition we are studying the viral kinetics in special populations of patients with chronic HCV infection, namely those with renal failure. These studies are in progress.Therapy of non-responders with advanced hepatitis C is problematic. One approach to prevent disease progression in non-responder patients with chronic HCV infection is to administer a therapy with anti-fibrotic effects long-term. Limited clinical and in vitro data suggest that interferon alfa may slow or arrest progression of injury-related fibrosis, even in non-responders who fail to clear virus. The LDB was one of 10 sites participating in a large NIH sponsored multicenter study, the HALT-C Trial: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term peginterferon alfa-2a for treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients who fail to respond to previous interferon therapy. This study revealed that long-term therapy with low dose peginterferon was ineffective at preventing clinical decompensation and fibrosis progression in patients with CHC with advanced liver fibrosis and therefore should not be recommended to patients. Ribavirin, a guanosine nucleoside analogue is critically important for the success of therapy for CHC. Several post-hoc analyses and one pilot study have suggested that higher doses of ribavirin may be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. Accordingly, we have initiated an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose ribavirin in combination with standard dose peginterferon alfa-2a for non-responder and relapser patients with CHC. Enrollment is scheduled to begin shortly.3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyThe conduct of clinical trials over the last 30 years has allowed the LDB to acquire invaluable clinical material (patient serum, liver tissue and lymphophocytes) to which state of the art laboratory techniques can be applied to address issues of the pathogenesis of HCV infection and the mechanisms of action of antiviral therapy. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is unknown. Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis due to an increase in the viral mutation rate has been shown to be a possible mechanism of ribavirin in poliovirus, bovine diarrhea virus and GBV-B, viruses very similar to HCV. We have previously shown that ribavirin use is associated with an early, transient increase in the mutation rate of HCV but this effect was not observed at later time points. This suggests that lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action of ribavirin during therapy for chronic HCV infection. Our plan is to extend this investigation, examining the effects of higher doses of ribavirin and the effects of the combination of ribavirin and interferon on viral mutation rate.',\n",
       " 'Vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis virus.A live attenuated TBEV vaccine is expected to induce a more durable protective immunity than that induced by the inactivated TBEV vaccine that is not licensed in the USA. Two live attenuated TBEV vaccine candidates are being developed in the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a non-neuroinvasive, mosquito-borne dengue-4 virus (DEN4) with a neurotropic, tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) or TBEV. Phase I clinical studies in humans with the LGT-based chimeric vaccine indicated that this vaccine was safe, induced a moderate neutralizing antibody response against LGT, but it was weakly immunogenic against the prevalent TBEV strains, indicating that the improvement in immunogenicity against TBEV is required. In FY 2008, we have focused on the identification of a chimeric TBEV/DEN4 vaccine candidate that is suitable for evaluation in humans and that exhibits the following important properties: (1) reduced neurovirulence and restricted replication in the brains of mice; (2) restricted or ablated neuroinvasiveness in immunodeficient mice; (3) decreased replication in rhesus monkeys; (4) ability to induce a protective TBEV-specific immune response in monkeys; and (5) a low level of neurovirulence in the CNS of non-human primates. We considered the second chimeric virus, TBEV/DEN4d30, as a possible vaccine candidate for evaluation in humans since it exhibits an evidence of attenuation for mice and monkeys and has satisfactory immunogenicity and protective efficacy in monkeys. However, it remained possible that this new chimeric virus, containing the structural protein genes derived from the highly neurovirulent Far Eastern strain of TBEV, might gain access to the CNS of vaccine recipients and cause neurological disease. Therefore, prior to clinical evaluation of this vaccine candidate in humans, it was necessary to further examine its neurovirulence in monkeys. We compared the neuropathogenesis of TBEV/DEN4d30, LGT, a former live TBEV vaccine, and yellow fever 17D vaccine (YF 17D) in rhesus monkeys inoculated intracerebrally. The results of histopathological analysis of the CNS together with clinical observations and data on virus replication indicated that chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV strain with non-neuroinvasive DEN4d30 had an attenuating effect on the neurovirulence of TBEV in monkeys. However, this effect was insufficient to justify bringing this vaccine candidate to trials in humans since TBEV/DEN4d30 exhibited higher neurovirulence in monkeys compared to either LGT or YF 17D, suggesting that it needs to be further attenuated.Since LGT and TBEV/DEN4d30 evoked a strong cellular inflammatory response in the CNS of monkeys, we have developed a new computerized method for quantitative evaluation of the CNS infiltration with peripheral immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD20 lymphocytes) and the response of CNS resident cells (microglial activation and neuronal degradation). We found that immunoreactivity for CD3 and CD4 T cells and CD20 B cells correlated remarkably well with semi-quantitative histopathological scores for cellular inflammatory infiltration in the brains of monkeys inoculated with either YF 17D, LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 attenuated viruses. Preliminary data from the correlation analyses indicate that a high CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in the CNS infiltrates induced in response to YF 17D infection is a major factor that differentiates this vaccine virus from a more neurovirulent LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 virus. It is likely that the balanced response of T and B cells within the CNS of monkeys induced with YF 17D vaccine virus plays an important role in the recovery from CNS infection and might serve as a reference to evaluate the safety of new live flavivirus vaccine candidates.Further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4d30 neurovirulence was undertaken by introducing amino acid substitutions that had previously been shown to reduce replication of LGT or DEN4 in suckling mouse brain. When two attenuating amino acid substitutions in the E and NS5 proteins were introduced into TBEV/DEN4d30 genome, the resulting virus (TBEV/DEN4d30-E-NS5) demonstrated the desired properties of an acceptable live attenuated vaccine candidate as it displayed (1) a 490-fold decrease in neurovirulence in suckling mice, (2) a non-neuroinvasive phenotype in immunodeficient mice, and (3) was still safe and immunogenic in monkeys. However, its neurovirulence and protective efficacy in non-human primates should be evaluated before clinical trials can be initiated.  Vaccines against West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus.A live attenuated WN/DEN4d30 virus vaccine is being developed in the LID to protect humans against WN disease. In a clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers, the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine was well tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable antibody response against WN. Trials to define the optimal dose of WN/DEN4d30 (10,000 or 100,000) and the optimal number of immunizations (one versus two) are in progress.Before the 1999 outbreak of WN, SLE had been the dominant flavivirus causing encephalitis in the USA. Antigenic chimeric viruses (SLE/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4d30) were generated using the chimeric approach proven successful for WN and TBEV. Both chimeras had greatly reduced neuroinvasiveness in immunodeficient mice but retained neurovirulence in suckling mice.  Chimerization of SLE with DEN4 resulted in only moderate restriction in replication in rhesus monkeys, whereas the presence of the d30 mutation led to over-attenuation.  Introduction of previously described attenuating paired charge-to-alanine mutations in the DEN4 NS5 protein of SLE/DEN4 reduced neurovirulence in mice and replication in rhesus monkeys.  Two modified SLE/DEN4 viruses have significantly reduced neurovirulence in mice and conferred protective immunity in monkeys against SLE challenge.  These viruses may be considered for use as SLE vaccine candidates and for use as diagnostic reagents with reduced virulence. Efforts are underway to identify a SLE/DEN4 virus that will exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity in monkeys.',\n",
       " 'The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) includes Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Powassan virus and Langat virus (LGTV). The TBFV are listed among the NIAID category B and C lists of priority for research on pathogenesis, to identify novel targets for therapeutic and vaccine development. As their name suggests, these viruses are transmitted by ticks, and following infection of humans, cause encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers resulting in approximately 13,000 hospitalizations annually with mortality rates as high as 40%. The TBFV belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, which comprise some of the most medically significant emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Other members include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Hence, research into the pathogenesis of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of this globally important group of viruses.The research in our laboratory aims to identify and understand interactions between the TBFV and their hosts (both the tick and the mammal) critical to virus replication and pathogenesis. We have been studying LGTV which is a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. This makes LGTV an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. In particular, our laboratory has a number of ongoing projects outlined below to study interactions between the TBFV and their hosts, with an emphasis on host innate immunity.1. Interactions between TBFV and host innate responses to infection.Following the bite from an infected tick, dendritic cells (DCs) resident in the skin of the mammalian host are among the first cell types infected by TBFV. These cells have important roles in innate immunity through the production of interferon (IFN), cytokines and chemokines, as well as in orchestrating adaptive immunity. Thus, early interactions between these cells and TBFV are likely to have a major influence on the outcome of infection. We have initiated a project in the lab to investigate the effects of TBFV infection on primary DCs and the ability of TBFV to modulate the signal transduction pathways involved in detecting virus infection and producing IFN. Following infection with LGTV, flow cytometry was used to distinguish between infected and uninfected bystander DCs. Maturation profiles revealed that infected DC, but not bystander cells, increased cell surface expression of MHC class II.  However, infected DC did not upregulate CD80 and CD86, costimulatory molecules involved in activating T cell responses.  Moreover, infected DC did not respond appropriately to stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or TLR4 ligands. The failure of LGTV-infected DC to express key molecules involved in anti-viral immunity in vivo may contribute to viral evasion of immune responses. Hence, examining these interactions will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to TBFV pathophysiology.Type I (IFN and IFN) and type II (IFN) IFNs are crucial elements of the innate immune response to flavivirus infection, restricting virus replication, dissemination and lethality in mouse models. Type I IFN treatment of humans is a leading therapeutic candidate for flavivirus infection. However, such treatment often fails. We have shown that LGTV interferes with IFN signaling by directly inhibiting Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signal transduction. In this manner, LGTV is similar to the mosquito-borne flaviviruses WNV, JEV, DEN and YFV, which can also inhibit IFN-mediated JAK-STAT signaling. Our laboratory demonstrated that the nonstructural protein, NS5, of LGTV suppresses JAK-STAT signaling in response to both type I and type II IFN. We have investigated the relative IFN antagonist ability of NS5 and another nonstructural protein NS4B (implicated in IFN antagonism for DEN) from different flaviviruses including WNV and JEV. These studies have identified NS5 as a major IFN antagonist for virulent strains of WNV in addition to the already known role of NS5 in IFN-evasion by JEV. NS5 from attenuated strains of both WNV and JEV had a lower intrinsic ability to suppress signaling than NS5 from virulent strains, suggesting that NS5 may be a flavivirus virulence determinant. Furthermore, we have mapped specific residues within LGTV NS5 responsible for IFN antagonism. Taken together, this work will provide further insight into the importance of IFN-evasion in flavivirus pathogenesis as well as contribute to the next generation of live-attenuated vaccine design.2.  Study of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. In addition to working with mouse models of infection, we have developed a novel method of infecting tick larvae with LGTV by immersion. This extremely versatile method permits synchronous infection of large numbers of ticks with a defined virus inoculum, and without a requirement for that virus to establish an infection and viremia in mice. This method not only enables study of virus replication within the initial infected tick larvae and nymphs, but also results in efficient trans-stadial transmission as well as horizontal transmission to C57BL/6 mice. Hence, the immersion method of infection is a powerful tool to study viral and host determinants for pathogenesis in both ticks and in the mammalian host. We are currently utilizing the immersion method of infection to examine global transcriptional responses of the tick, Ixodes scapularis, to infection with LGTV using Agilent microarrays. The aim of this work is to identify tick host proteins important for the replication or transmission of TBFV. These proteins can be used for the development of novel anti-tick vaccines that prevent virus transmission to the immunized mammalian host. We are also interested in identifying virus determinants that confer a selective replication advantage in either tick or mammalian systems and understanding how these determinants influence pathogenesis in the mammalian host. To examine these questions, we derived two LGTV variants by repeatedly passaging the virus in tick or mammalian cell culture, followed by sequencing of the virus genome. To summarize this work, we identified two clusters of coding changes in the LGTV genome associated with host adaptation and altered pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. The first was in the envelope (E) protein while the second was in the region encompassing NS3, NS4A and NS4B. We plan to use the two animal models of infection, both tick and mouse, in combination with reverse genetics to determine the relative contribution of these genetic changes to virus transmission and virulence.',\n",
       " \"Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man, where they generally       induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association       between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain human papillomavirus (HPV)       types, most frequently HPV 16. Our research is primarily concerned with development of       vaccines and other infection inhibition strategies against HPV and the elucidation of the PV       life cycle. We have developed a simple and efficient strategy for generating high titers of       infectious papillomavirus particles that transduce encapsidated marker plasmids, referred to       hereafter as pseudovirions. This methodology represents a technical breakthrough in       papillomavirus research. We have exploited this technology in our basic virologic and       translational research efforts. Pseudovirus production technology is being used to explore the       basic features of papillomavirus infection and mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization.       We have determined that a cleavage of the terminus of L2 by the cellular proprotein convertase       furin is required for papillomavirus infection. This cleavage presumably exposes a binding       site for a conserved cellular receptor, because in other studies we have determined that       broadly cross-type neutralizing L2 antibodies bind the peptide immediately downstream of the       furin cleavage site. This cleavage site is not exposed on muture virions in solution. Rather       it becomes exposed only after engagement of the cell surface and/or extracellular matrix and a       resulting conformation change in the capsid. We have determined that, surprisingly, the major       class of neutralizing antibodies induced by the licensed L1 VLP vaccines does not prevent cell       surface binding. Rather these antibodies prevent the change in virion conformation required       for furin cleavage of L2, resulting in retention of the virions on the cell surface. In       contrast, the antibodies induced by our broadly cross-neutralizing L2 vaccines induce the       disassociation of the virions from the cell surface, presumably by preventing engagement of a       secondary cell surface receptor. We have used our pseudovirus technology to develop the first       cervicovaginal challenge model for HPVs. We have found that the infection of the female mouse       genital tract, even of monolayer endocervical cells, requires exposure the basement membrane       to the virus. The capsids bind avidly to the basement membrane but not to the apical surfaces       of intact columnar or stratified squamous epithelia. Using a quantitative assay based on whole       tissue fluorecence imaging after infection with red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing       pseudovirions, we have further determined that nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and Conceptrol, an over the       counter spermacide that containing N-9, dramatically potentiate in vivo papillomavirus       infection, presumably due to it's ability to permeablize the epithelial layers and thereby       expose the basement membrane to the virus. Interesting, no infection was detected if       nonoxynol-9 was formulated in carrageenan rather than its normal gelling agent. Carrageenan is       an algal polysaccharide widely used in processed food and cosmetics and is the main gelling       agent in some over-the-counter lubricants. We had previously shown that carragenen, and       products that contain it, are extremely potent inhibitors of HPV infection in vitro. The       results suggest that women using N-9 spermacides may be at increased risk of acquiring genital       HPV infection and that this risk might be eliminated by reformulation of N-9 in a carrageenan       based gel. We are currently working with the NCI extramural division DCP to initiate a       clinical trial of carrageenan as a microbicide to prevent genital HPV infection in young       women. Our studies in the mouse cervicovaginal challenge model suggested that other       interventions that compromise the integrity of the genital epithelium might also potentiate       HPV infection. Acquisition of ecto- and endocervical cells for cytology (Pap) screening       disrupts the epithelium by design. Therefore we sought to determine whether the cytology       specimen (Pap smear) collection procedure renders the cervix more susceptible to HPV infection       in a rhesus macaque model. In unpublished studies, we found that the Pap smear collection       procedure greatly potentiated infection by RFP expressing HPV16 pseudovirus. However, use of a       carrageenan gel rather than Surgilube as the lubricant used for the internal digital exam       after specimen collection largely abrogated the infection enhancing effect. These findings       suggest that cytology screening in women might lead to a transient enhancement of       susceptibility to HPV infection and that use of a carrageenan-based gel during the examine       might mitigate this enhancement. Our development of a method to induce efficient HPV       pseudovirus infection of the female genital tract after transient disruption with N-9 has       proven to be the key to our recent development of an effective intravaginal vaccination       strategy. In patent pending studies, we have found that intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination       of N-9 treated mice induces strong systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to target       antigens transduced by the pseudovirions. Systemic responses rival those induced by       intramuscular injection of optimized Ad5 vectors. Intravaginal vaccination could serve to       focus immune responses to the female genital tract and so increase the effectiveness of       vaccines directed against HSV and HIV infections and for immunotheraphy of HPV induced       neoplasia. To more generally evaluate the potential of HPV pseudoviruses as gene transfer       vehicles, we have conducted a broad infection tropism survey. In patent pending studies, we       demonstrated that intact murine epithelium at all sites test, whether simple, columnar, or       squamous, was highly resistant to both virion binding and infection, whereas disrupted       epithelium was susceptible. In contrast, virtually all human epithelial tumor lines in the       NC1-60 panel were highly susceptible to infection in vitro. The remarkable specificity of HPV       pseudovirus binding and infection suggests that they may be useful in tumor diagnostic or       cytotoxic gene therapy applications. In proof of concept studies, we documented highly       specific binding and infection, and dramatic imaging, of human ovarian tumor nodules implanted       in nude mouse peritoneum after intraperitoneal instillation of RFP-expressing pseudovirus.\",\n",
       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-bourne member of the Flavivirus genus that has a global impact on public heath due to its widespread distribution and the ability to cause severe disease in humans. Each year, 50-100 million individuals are infected by DENV, with clinical manifestations ranging from a self-limiting acute febrile illness (dengue fever) to a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF). Four related serotypes of DENV circulate in nature, each capable of causing the full spectrum of DENV-related disease.  Prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrate that sequential infection with two DENV serotypes is associated with a more severe disease course.  The number of DHF cases reported has increased dramatically during the past twenty years, and now exceeds 250,000 cases annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV.Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in protection from and clearance of flavivirus infection. Antibodies have been mapped to all three structural domains of the E protein (DI-DIII) that exhibit varying degrees of neutralization potency and confer protection by multiple effector mechanisms. Eliciting neutralizing antibody is a major goal of vaccine development. Complicating these efforts is a requirement for vaccines to simultaneously elicit protection against four different viruses that while antigenically related, share only some of the antibody-binding determinants thought to contribute to virus neutralization. Thus, antibodies raised against one serotype of DENV may react with virions of another serotype, but often with reduced affinity and functional potency.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of DHF cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. At birth, DENV-specific passively acquired antibodies are present at a relatively high concentration and exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro. However, as the child ages, degradation of maternally acquired antibody continues to levels that are no longer protective, do not neutralize virus, and enhance virus infection in vitro. The waning antibody titers of infants to levels that support ADE in vitro parallels the risk of DHF following primary DENV infection during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE.The development of a protective tetravalent response is complicated by the possibility that not all four components of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may be equally immunogenic in the vaccinee. Interference and uneven levels of infectivity among DENV strains in this context has been reported. Understanding the immunogenicity of each component of a tetravalent vaccine is an important aspect of vaccine development and identifying appropriate correlates of protection, particularly because it is presently unclear how many serotype-specific responses will be required for protection from all four serotypes of DENV. However, dissecting the specific contribution of each element of a tetravalent vaccine is technically challenging due to the presence of antibodies that bind cross-reactive determinants shared by different components of the vaccine. A detailed map of the functionally important type-specific and group-reactive epitopes on the E protein is not presently available. Improved methodology that distinguishes and quantifies the functional contribution of each component of a tetravalent vaccine would allow for improvements in estimates of vaccine immunogenicity, for a more precise correlate of protection, and for a powerful investigational tool to study vaccine success and failure.To that end, we propose to develop a novel approach to measure the functional contributions of serotype-specific antibodies against the backdrop of a highly cross-reactive tetravalent polyclonal response. A panel of reporter virus particles (RVPs) containing mutations that destroy antibody-binding determinants will be used to identify functionally important epitopes that elicit type-specific or cross-reactive antibodies present in the serum of DENV vaccinees. An iterative screening process will guide selection of RVPs that are either no longer sensitive to neutralization by cross-reactive antibodies or type-specific responses. RVPs with these characteristics provide two complementary and specific methods for detecting type-specific responses in polyclonal sera as described below.  These tools will then be employed to characterize the epitopes that comprise the neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated or naturally infected humans.  Furthermore, we will investigate the dynamics of the antibody repertoire over time.',\n",

Technical Summary  This project from North Dakota State University aims for acquisition of a remotely operable analytical field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, along with specimen preparation equipment. These instruments for shared use will support state-of-the-art imaging and microanalysis, as well as research training, classroom education, and outreach. The NDSU Electron Microscopy Center is a multidisciplinary multi-user facility. The current SEMs at the center are not FE instruments and thus have limited application in several material systems.  A FE instrument will allow high resolution imaging at lower voltages suitable for such material systems. Versatile high-resolution SEM imaging and microanalysis are essential to support current research in areas including medicinal chemistry, nanomaterials, nanocomposites, polymeric coatings, biomaterials, tissue engineering, environmental engineering, and also biological materials such as soft and hard tissues. Remote operation will benefit the largest possible number of scientists and potential scientists. The proposed equipment will also be a much-needed resource for NDSU's new PhD program in Materials and Nanotechnology. The FE SEM will also support local and regional industries. The FE SEM will provide hands-on experience to broaden opportunities for research, training, and outreach for faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates from NDSU and other area colleges, and K-12 teachers and students. The proposed instrumentation will strengthen participation in North Dakota?s EPSCoR NATURE (Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education) initiative, an effort with the state?s five tribal colleges designed to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics among Native American high-school students. Layman SummaryThe proposed equipment for high-resolution field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) will promote growth and integration of education, research, and technological industry in novel areas of materials and biological research. The new FE-SEM will be a necessary addition to the suite of electron microscopes at NDSU electron microscopy center. The current requested instrument will provide high resolution at lower voltages and thus enhancing imaging and microanalysis research in soft materials (polymers and polymeric nanocomposites) and biological nanomaterials (soft tissues etc.) research with minimal beam damage to the samples. Extensive educational impact will be realized with installation of this equipment, at NDSU and the region, to researchers, students and remote accessibility and operation to K-12 students, Native American college and school students etc. Extensive integration and synergy with existing outreach and educational programs at NDSU will be realized.

       " \"0943424KarimIntellectual Merit: This EAGER proposal is a high risk high gain proposal. Recent outbreak of H1N1 flu and the worldwide spread of H5N1 avian influenza virus and its infection to human beings has raised a global concern about these viruses to cause a pandemic. According to the World Health Organization report of May 20, 2009, 41 countries have confirmed 10,243 cases of H1N1 flu with 80 fatalities. In the US, these numbers are 5,469 and 6, respectively. A treatment or a rapid vaccination process for H1N1 and H5N1 is urgently needed. The proposal addresses this issue in this transformative idea to develop a peptide-based membrane system so that flu viruses can be captured from either a cell culture broth or from human blood. The main goal is to develop a cell culture-based vaccine production method, which uses a peptide-based purification step. The peptide is developed using the available genomic information regarding hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of flu viruses. We hypothesize that for a given virus, an affinity peptide with a high specificity could be selected by using a screening tool. Moreover, with the chemical attachment of the affinity peptide group to a membrane surface, this affinity matrix could be used to repeatedly bind and elute the specific type of virus. We further hypothesize that the virus surface protein plays a significant role on the virus binding process. Therefore, an affinity membrane designed based on a specific strain of influenza virus may be used to bind other viruses which have high homogeneity to this virus. This research will be helpful in better understanding the role of the virus surface protein on the affinity binding process. A term of 'homogeneity' is usually used to describe how similar two influenza virus strains are. By choosing several influenza viruses with different homogeneity, the effect of the surface protein on the virus binding to an affinity membrane could be characterized. This research will answer the question regarding how sensitive the effect of the homogeneity is on the binding of a virus to a given affinity membrane.Since microporous affinity membrane combines both the advantages of the microfiltration and resin based affinity chromatography, the virus production and purification process could be significantly simplified. This is specifically suitable for the cell culture based influenza virus vaccine production process. By carefully choosing an appropriate membrane pore size, cells removal and virus purification could be achieved within one step. Cell cultures will be flown through one side of a microporous affinity membrane. During this period, cells and cell debris will be rejected by the membrane pores while viruses and proteins and/or DNA and other small biological components will migrate inside the membrane pores. Viruses will then be specifically bound by these functional peptide groups grafted on the membrane pore surface while protein, DNA and other biological components will pass through the membrane pores. After washing, viruses with high purity can be eluted from the bounded membranes. This simplification of the purification process may speed up the H1N1 and H5N1 vaccine development, commercialization and production process.Broader Impact: Completion of the proposed studies will have significant impact and possible applications in H1N1 and H5H1 flu intervention. The proposed new peptide-based membrane will simplify the virus purification process and it may speed up the vaccine development, commercialization and production process. The prepared membrane may also be used in the virus diagnosis by quick collection and purification of virus samples. Further, this method may be extended to diagnose other viruses, such as the West Nile virus. Further, a possible clinical device may be developed which can specifically remove viruses from human blood. By circulating human blood through a membrane device containing affinity membranes for a specific flu virus, these viruses can be made to bind to the membrane surfaces thus reducing the overall virus population in the blood; this device may be then combined with some other intervention methods such as using TAMIFLU. This project will involve multidisciplinary researchers from Chemical Engineering and TTU Health Sciences Center. One of the educational goals of the project is to train one post-doc and one PhD student in the cutting edge research of vaccine and peptide-based membrane technology. An undergraduate student will be selected from well publicized outreach programs at TTU, e.g. Engineering Outreach Center, and McNair Scholars Program. The UG student will then be encouraged to go to graduate school and have a career in bio related field. The PI has significant experience in attracting female and minority candidates to his research group. Outreach to local schools will be done through funded programs such as Science it's a Girl's Thing, Pre-college Engineering, Teacher Training Workshop, and Engineering Outreach Mentor.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) occurs in approximately 40,000 infants a year in the United States annually and is the leading viral cause of birth defects. These problems together with the severe disease that HCMV causes in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients provides a strong impetus for the development of an effective vaccine. However, unlike viruses that are cleared by the host, the ability of HCMV to persist even in the presence of high levels of host immunity suggests that novel approaches are needed for the development of a vaccine. Because results in the murine CMV (MCMV) model have shown that CD8+ T cells specific for an immunodominant antigen are ineffective at limiting viral replication, we speculated that vaccination using these antigens may at best elicit immunity that is not significantly greater than that generated during the natural infection: protection that is ultimately incomplete since the virus persists and can cause recurrent infection and congenital transmission. We hypothesized that the essential viral proteins that are highly conserved among the CMVs may represent a novel class of T cell targets. The rationale is that these genes must be expressed for viral replication, and the high amino acid conservation needed for maintaining protein activity limits immune escape by mutation. Because these antigens have been found to be mostly subdominant during infection with HCMV or MCMV, we hypothesized that priming of T cells against these antigens may result in qualitatively greater protective immunity than the natural infection. To this end, we have recently shown that DNA immunization using either of two conserved, essential genes of MCMV (the DNA polymerase M54 and the helicase M105) protects mice against a subsequent sublethal challenge with virulent virus. We have also developed a DNA prime - whole, inactivated virus boost strategy that elicits both CD8+ T cell responses as well as strong neutralizing antibodies, and we demonstrated that this prime-boost vaccination conferred complete protection against systemic viral challenge and significant protection against mucosal viral challenge. However, since MCMV does not cause infection in utero, studies of the prevention of congenital CMV infection have utilized the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) model. While the GPCMV vaccines that have been tested in the guinea pig model have provided statistically significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes, no vaccine has conferred complete protection against mortality or infection. In this proposal, we plan to use the GPCMV model of congenital CMV infection to demonstrate  proof-of-principle  that prime-boost immunization with the conserved, essential genes of GPCMV followed by chemically killed GPCMV is protective against congenital GPCMV infection and disease and to provide the justification for pursuing more comprehensive preclinical studies of immunity and protection. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1. Determination of the protective efficacy of prime-boost vaccination with a trivalent DNA (consisting of DNA polymerase, helicase, and glycoprotein B genes) followed by inactivated GPCMV in the guinea pig model of congenital infection and disease, and 2. Characterization of the relative contributions to immunity and protection provided by the DNA polymerase and helicase DNAs, the glycoprotein B DNA, and the inactivated virus. The novel aspects of our proposed vaccine are both the choice of the highly conserved essential viral genes for generating T lymphocyte responses in the priming step as well as the use of a whole, killed virus in the boosting step that together can completely protect against systemic CMV challenge. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congenital infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) occurs in approximately 40,000 infants a year in the United States annually and is the leading viral cause of birth defects. These problems together with the severe disease that HCMV causes in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients provides a strong impetus for the development of an effective vaccine.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of virus specific immune responses in HIV exposed and infected individuals as well as SIV vaccine studies in monkeys suggest that it is unlikely that vaccine approaches that stimulate a single arm of the immune system will provide effective protection from viral infection. Several studies have shown that strong CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses may be elicited by infection or vaccine candidates, which may correlate with marginal decreases in viral loads, yet these do not correlate with protection from infection or disease progression. However, In addition to CTL, B-lymphocytes also play an important role in the immune response to infection by secreting neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to combat invading pathogens. There is evidence that HIV-1 impairs protective immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses against pathogens and vaccines by inducing progressive loss of these CD4+ T helper cells. The presence of low levels of memory B cells and defective naive B cells in HIV infected patients have also been reported. In summary, B cell dysregulation is likely to play a major role in the progression to AIDS in HIV-infected patients. If so, this in turn suggests that maintenance of normal humoral immune responses may be the key to preventing and controlling infection. HIV-specific mucosal IgA and systemic cellular responses in HIV protection have both been proposed to play a role in studies of discordant heterosexual couples. In addition, several new findings suggest SIV-specific IgA responses in mucosal and peripheral immune compartments are important in controlling viral infection. Recent reports have also shown that the specificity and quantitative properties of antibody binding to antigen plays an important role in determining the neutralizing activity of the antibody. Thus we hypothesize that differences in the quality of antigen specific immunoglobulin (Ig) responses will be observed in animals in which viral loads are reduced or undetectable compared to animals that have persistent viremia and progress to AIDS. We also hypothesize that the level of antigen-antibody binding properties and antigen-specific effector memory B cells in tissues or secretory Ig will correlate with the reduction of viral load or disease progression in SIV infected macaques. In the proposed studies, we will examine and compare SIV-specific IgA, IgG and IgM immune responses and antibody binding properties in peripheral blood, and mucosal secretions of macaques inoculated with SIVmac251 and/or SHIVsf162p3. We will also examine the effector function of memory B cells in peripheral blood, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL), bone marrow (BM), small intestine and lymph node tissues from SIV infected macaques. The specific aims are:   Specific Aim 1: To compare the role of antigen specific IgA, IgG and IgM immune responses in macaques with different levels of immunity to SIV/SHIV infection. We will compare antigen specific IgA, IgG and IgM responses in macaques intravenously, intravaginally, and intrarectally inoculated with SIVmac251 (a highly pathogenic virus that consistently results in persistent viremia and AIDS). Antigen specific immunoglobulin responses will also be assessed in SIVmac251 and SHIVsf162p3 inoculated macaques which are able to control their infection and become long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). We will also be able to identify major IgA, IgG and IgM specific B cell epitopes and their role in differentiating the immune responses of SIV inoculated protected and unprotected macaques.   Specific Aim 2: To determine the kinetics of antibody binding properties in macaques with different levels of immunity to SIV/SHIV infection. We will also compare quantitative and qualitative binding properties of all longitudinal plasma/serum samples and/or mucosal secretions from macaques with different levels of immunity to trimeric recombinant SIV/SHIVgp140 envelope proteins using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology (Biacore). We expect that a difference in the quality of antibody population might exist in macaques which are able to control viremia compared to those that rapidly progress to AIDS.   Specific Aim 3: To quantify effector memory B cells in macaques infected with SIV by different routes of inoculation. We hypothesize that mucosal immune responses may differ depending on the route of inoculation. Thus, effector memory B cells will be evaluated and quantified in different tissues including peripheral blood, intestines, lymph nodes, BM, and BAL samples of intravenously and mucosally inoculated macaques. We will also quantify secretory IgA and IgG from both systemic and mucosal immune sites. Using this approach, we predict that we will be able to correlate SIV specific mucosal immune responses with reduction of viremia and protection from disease progression in macaques infected with pathogenic viruses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies of virus specific immune responses in HIV exposed and infected individuals as well as SIV vaccine studies in monkeys suggest that it is unlikely that vaccine approaches that stimulate a single arm of the immune system will provide effective protection from viral infection.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations. Currently, there is no effective vaccine against CMV. Development of a vaccine, particularly for women of child-bearing age, is considered to be a major public health priority because of the risk of congenital infection to the fetus. This application proposes the use of a replication-impaired live CMV vaccine lacking an essential gene. The mutant viruses will be capable of infecting non-complementing cells in an abortive single cycle of virus replication but incapable of producing infectious virus. We hypothesize that a disabled infectious single cycle (DISC) vaccine against CMV would be non-pathogenic, regardless of virus dosage used, but highly immunogenic inducing antibody and T-cell responses to an array of viral antigens. Additionally, we propose that the effectiveness of such a DISC vaccine against CMV will be further augmented by introducing a second copy of the major neutralizing antigen, glycoprotein gB, into the viral genome. We also hypothesize that the co-administration of the vaccine strain with a pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-12) adjuvant will polarize the T cell helper type 1 (Th1) immune response against the virus creating a bias towards a cell mediated immune response. Human CMV, as with all CMV, is a species specific virus and consequently animal CMVs in their respective hosts must be studied to test any proposed vaccine or antiviral strategy. Among the small animal models of CMV only the guinea pig model allows the study of congenital infection. Our long-term goal is the continued development of this model to test intervention strategies against congenital infection in particular pre-conception vaccines. As proof of principle for the CMV DISC vaccine strategy these studies will be carried out in the guinea pig model. The proposed research will define the antibody and cellular immune responses to a series of vaccine candidate CMV DISC strains. Additionally, the research will determine the ability of candidate DISC vaccines to protect against congenital CMV infection in comparison to a recombinant gB subunit vaccine strategy that has previously been tested in this model.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCMV is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised populations. Primary HCMV infection in immunocompetent individuals is usually benign but establishes a lifelong latent infection. Solid organ transplant recipients or AIDS patients are particularly susceptible to reactivation of the virus, which can lead to life-threatening end-organ disease. Congenital infection of newborns by HCMV (approximately 1% of live births in the US) can lead to serious symptomatic disease including mental retardation and hearing loss. Indeed it is estimated that congenital HCMV related sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs at a greater frequency than SNHL related to Hemophilus influenza infection in the pre-HIB vaccine era. Furthermore, congenital HCMV infection is the second most common cause of mental retardation next to Down's syndrome in newborns. Although antivirals are available for treatment of AIDS and transplant patients these drugs cannot be used to prevent congenital infection because of the risk of toxic side effects on the fetus. Additionally, antivirals act at late stages of virus infection and can result in the development of resistant strains with prolonged therapy. Consequently, a vaccine against HCMV is probably the most effective method of preventing or lowering the incidence of disease. Additionally, a vaccine would save considerably in the resources currently employed for the long term treatment/ care of congenitally infected newborns with severe hearing loss and mental retardation.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza is a global infectious viral disease of great public health concern affecting millions of people every year. Influenza viruses cause increased morbidity and mortality in the range of 20,000-40,000 death/yr in USA alone and economic loss of 10-20 billions of dollars/yr. Vaccines are in short supply essentially every year. Furthermore, there is a bird flu or avian flu virus posing a global pandemic threat against which there is no effective vaccine and massive amount of vaccine will be required to combat the pandemic if and when it occurs. With the increasing aging population, this risk is increasing every year and a possibility of a new pandemic looming. Therefore a highly attenuated live vaccine is urgently needed. Our preliminary studies have identified that in A/WSN/33(H1N1) virus, a conserved CCHH motif (the putative zinc finger motif) of influenza virus matrix protein (M1) can be mutated without affecting virus replication in MDCK cells in culture. Some CCHH mutant viruses were highly attenuated in mice and protected mice against lethal WT virus challenge. In this project, we want to create these mutations in A/PR8/34(H1N1) virus which is commonly used for making influenza vaccine and test the effect of these mutations in mice virulence, growth in cell cultures and embryonated chicken eggs and protection efficiency against WT lethal virus challenge. In addition, other mutations in other genes will be added to CCHH mutations and their effect on virulence, stability, growth in cell cultures and embryonated eggs and protection efficiency will be determined. A highly attenuated and avirulent PR8 virus can be used as master strain for generating highly attenuated live influenza vaccine. Live attenuated vaccine produced in this way will be less thermo-labile than the presently used cold adapted vaccine. Live vaccine can be grown easily in cell culture or in embryonated chicken eggs. A live vaccine can be delivered easily and a smaller dose will be required to immunize people providing plenty supply of vaccine. Live vaccine will also produce broader and long lasting protective immunity against epidemic and/or pandemic viruses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is a global infectious viral disease of great public health concern affecting millions of people every year. The goal of this project is to create highly attenuated PR8 viruses which can be used as master strains for generating live attenuated influenza vaccine. Live attenuated vaccines can be produced in mass quantity, delivered easily and will produce broader and long lasting protective immunity against virulent influenza viruses.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza is one of the major public health threats and NIH biodefense research priorities. Transmission of H5N1 influenza virus from the avian species to human shows great urgency for the development of an effective vaccine against influenza. The objective of this research is to develop an effective influenza vaccine using the relatively conserved matrix protein 2 (M2) of H5N1 avian influenza A virus as an antigen delivered by a detoxified anthrax edema toxin. Since the anthrax toxins are capable of entering host cells for antigen delivery through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II pathways, the proposed vaccine may elicit potent cell-mediated immunity against influenza antigens. We hypothesize that the proposed vaccine is able to cross-protect against H5N1 and other types of influenza A viruses. Importantly, the proposed vaccine could be administrated through a noninvasive nasal mucosal route which is convenient for administration and maybe more efficient to elicit mucosal immunity for protection against a possible pandemic influenza. In order to evaluate these hypotheses, we will evaluate the efficacy of intranasal delivery of the proposed vaccine in a mouse model. The specific aims of this project are: Specific Aim #1: To produce recombinant fusion N-fragment of anthrax edema factor with M2. Specific Aim #2: To study the systemic and mucosal immunity against influenza viruses after intranasal vaccination in mice with the fusion EFn/M2 in combination with the anthrax protective antigen. Specific Aim #3: To determine the efficacy of the proposed vaccine for protection against H5 and other influenza A virus strains in a mouse model. Specific Aim #4: To assess toxicity of the proposed vaccine in animals after vaccination. The success of the proposed research will provide not only a new and easily administered influenza vaccine but also a platform for development of mucosal vaccines against other infectious diseases.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is both a major public health threat and a NIAID biodefense research priority. Transmission of H5N1 influenza virus from the avian species to human shows great urgency for the development of an effective vaccine against influenza viruses. We propose to develop a vaccine which could be administrated through a noninvasive nasal mucosal route and maybe more efficient to elicit mucosal and systemic immunity for protection against a possible pandemic influenza. This will meet the urgent need for public health.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis is a global disease of immense impact on mankind. More people die of tuberculosis each year than due to other diseases. The available BCG vaccine is partially protective against children and is not effective against adult disease. We have determined that one major factor that contributes to the reduced efficacy of BCG vaccine is its ability to prevent effective antigen processing in macrophages. We also discovered that a mutant vaccine from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (?fbpA) protects mice better than BCG. This investigation will therefore use this candidate vaccine and test the hypothesis that improved 'peptide antigen processing' in dendritic cells will pave the way for development of a more effective vaccine against tuberculosis. Due to phagosome maturation arrest, structural antigens of BCG vaccine remain sequestered within phagosomes while its secreted antigens are minimally processed for MHC-II and MHC-I peptide epitopes. In contrast, ?fbpA novel vaccine undergoes limited phagosome maturation, with enhanced peptide presentation for MHC-II pathway and we hypothesize that it also presents peptides through MHC-I mechanism. Unlike the currently used BCG vaccine, ?fbpA has intact ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins and we will enhance antigenicity by modification of pathogen components through selective deletion of genes as well as over expression of ESAT-6, Ag85B and CFP-10 antigens. We will therefore identify pathogen components that elicit protective immune responses relevant to vaccine design and prepare novel vaccine constructs through genetic engineering with increased immunogenicity and safety. The major goal of this proposal is to develop a phagosome maturation competent derivative of ?fbpA vaccine that is expected to be more efficiently processed by dendritic cells to present more immunogenic peptides than previous vaccines. The aims are to- I) Investigate the intracellular strategies that increase the immunogenicity of ?fbpA candidate vaccine by enhancing the presentation of MHC-II peptides, and II) Characterize the MHC-I peptides that increase the immunogenicity of ?fbpA candidate vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to bacterial infections and prevention of this disease through a vaccine will have an impact on the public health and future of mankind. AIDS and tuberculosis is a deadly combination in sub saharan Africa and Asia and efforts are also needed to develop polyvalent vaccines. This proposal addresses this issue as well. This is a research grant proposal that seeks to develop a new vaccine for tuberculosis using genetic manipulations of the wild type Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An initial candidate vaccine that lacks Ag85A (?fbpA) has already been produced that shows promising vaccine efficacy due to its nature of limited phagosome maturation leading to enhanced antigen presentation. The highly immunogenic vaccine can be potentially used as a polyvalent carrier vaccine and in a safer form for multiple diseases of the human disease. The project is a collaborative proposal which involves investigators at the University of Heath Sciences Center Houston (Dr. Jagannath and Dr. Hunter) University of Heath Sciences Center-San Antonio (Dr. Dhandayuthapani) and University of Oklahoma (Dr. William Hildebrand). The teams will perform vaccine evaluation, genetic re-construction and epitope discovery in a highly synergistic manner and boost our existing knowledge on anti-tuberculosis vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a vaccine against HIV is the only hope of controlling the AIDS pandemic. However, although cell mediated immune (CMI) responses have been shown to be important for controlling the virus in infected persons, identification and success of a vaccine that could induce these responses has remained elusive. The ability of DNA vaccine to elicit CMI response and its safe profile makes plasmid DNA an attractive alternative to traditional vaccines. However, despite some success of DNA based immunization through intramuscular route, it shows poor immunogenicity especially in nonhuman primates & humans. Recent studies have highlighted the intestinal mucosa as the primary site of HIV-infection and therefore vaccine strategies should be aimed at induction of mucosal immunity. We expect that oral DNA vaccination will, thus, be the most effective approach in providing protection against HIV. Two specific aims are proposed in this project. In the first aim we will fabricate and characterize target specific poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles encapsulated with broad spectrum simian-HIV (SHIV) DNA vaccine followed by screening for the expression of HIV-1 proteins in cell culture. This will allow identification of viable gene delivery vector(s) for oral delivery of DNA vaccine in mice. In the second aim we will investigate the ability of the orally administered nanoparticles to express genes in the APCs of gastrointestinal tract and then test the immune responses generated against the SHIV-DNA vaccine in mice. We expect that this approach will strongly generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses with a single oral immunization of a relatively small dose of DNA vaccine. The long term goal of this proposal is to develop DNA vaccine encapsulated nanoparticles, as an effective oral vaccination strategy against HIV-infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will augment current efforts to develop an effective prophylactic vaccine against HIV, the only hope of controlling the AIDS pandemic, thus, directly addressing the goals of the NIH for improving human health through a multidisciplinary effort to prevent infectious disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad species tropisms and the ability to cause fatal disease in both animals and humans have distinguished the Henipaviruses; Nipah virus and Hendra virus from all other paramyxoviruses. They can be amplified and cause disease in animals and be transmitted to humans where infection presents as a severe respiratory illness and/or febrile encephalitis. Hendra appeared in Australia in 1994 and was transmitted to humans from infected horses; Nipah appeared in1998 in Malaysia and was passed from infected pigs to humans, but several animal species were also infected. Since their initial discovery, five additional Hendra spill-over events have been reported from 1995 to 2007 and Nipah outbreaks have occurred on a regular basis in Bangladesh and India. We have been extensively studying Hendra and Nipah for several years and have characterized the envelope glycoproteins (F and G), developed animal models of virus infection and pathogenesis. We have identified the cellular receptor for both viruses (ephrinB2), developed a soluble G (sG) subunit vaccine and the first and only potent neutralizing and cross-reactive, fully-human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Most recently, we have conducted a series of preliminary virus challenge experiments in nonhuman primates (NHPs). There are presently no approved active or passive therapeutic modalities for Nipah or Hendra infection and there is a critical need for a NHP model for Nipah and Hendra infection. This proposal will bring together the expertise to fully develop and evaluate an African Green Monkey model and test several pre- and post-exposure therapeutic modalities for Nipah virus infection. The main objectives of this proposal will be to: fully characterize a NHP model of Nipah virus infection and evaluate several existing and develop new potential therapeutics for Nipah and Hendra virus infection. Specifically, we will: 1. Establish virus infection, lethal dose, and detection parameters of Nipah and Hendra virus in a nonhuman primate model. 2. Evaluate the protective efficacy of recombinant sG and sF as subunit vaccines for Nipah and Hendra virus in the AGM. 3. Determine the passive protective efficacy of a neutralizing, anti-G, fully-human mAb therapy for Nipah and Hendra virus infection in the AGM. 4. Determine the passive protective efficacy of fusion inhibitor peptide and small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy for Nipah and Hendra virus infection in the AGM. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nipah and Hendra are NIAID Priority Pathogens and classified as BSL4 select agents and possess several characteristics which make them highly adaptable for their use as a deliberate release for malicious intent. Recent Nipah outbreaks have involved significant numbers of humans with high fatality >75% and documented person-to-person transmission. The development of therapeutics and vaccine strategies is now important.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are likely to cause an influenza pandemic at some point in the future. Traditional methods of influenza vaccine production will probably be too slow to allow an effective response to such a pandemic. Development of rapidly deployable vaccine platforms capable of protecting against such a pandemic is therefore of major importance. Vaccine vectors based on recombinant live, attenuated or replication- defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are among the most potent vaccine vectors tested to date. They also have a major advantage in that there is no pre-existing immunity to the vector in the human population. VSV vectors expressing an H5N1 hemmaglutinin (HA) protein from an HPAI virus induce high-titer broadly neutralizing (cross-clade) antibodies in both mice and non-human primates. They also protect against lethal AIV infection. The goal of the current project is to further develop and test novel, optimized, VSV-based AIV vaccine vectors that produce much higher levels of the AIV HA. These vectors should also induce much higher neutralizing antibody titers and are expected to generate maximal cross-clade neutralizing antibody titers to AIVs. The optimized, highly attenuated or replication-defective, single-cycle VSV vectors to be developed could form the basis for a broadly protective AIV vaccine that could be produced and deployed rapidly in response to an influenza virus pandemic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza pandemics in the 20th century are estimated to have killed more than 40 million people worldwide. Future pandemics will surely occur and are highly likely to result from mutation of avian influenza virus and crossover into the human population. The goal of this project is to develop a novel type of vaccine that elicits very broad neutralizing antibody and broad protection against avian influenza virus strains. In addition, unlike traditional influenza vaccines, this vaccine could be produced and deployed rapidly to halt a pandemic.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for the effectiveness of community-based psychosocial treatments for adolescent substance use disorders is mixed, at best. Researchers' inability to detect strong or replicable treatment effects may result from their focus on the post-treatment effects of a single incident treatment episode. Recent conceptualizations of addiction and treatment suggest that these approaches which compare pre-post treatment effects may obscure some of treatment's most salient effects. For one, treatment effects should be expected to be greatest during treatment or concurrently. Second, from a treatment careers perspective, multiple treatment episodes over time are likely to lead to cumulative effects, which would be greater than those observed for any individual treatment episode. Finally, considerations of client heterogeneity suggest that effects of treatment may be greatest for a subgroup of patients (moderated effects), with such effects being obscured when combined with the smaller effects expected for other patients.  With this renewal we propose to estimate the causal effects of treatment on adolescent outcomes by examining these three types of treatment effects which addiction theory suggests have an important role, but which have yet to be satisfactorily measured.  To do so, we have assembled a large set of adolescent treatment outcomes data collected by RAND, the Center on Substance Abuse Treatment, and Chestnut Health Systems and which include background information, treatment outcomes and treatment histories for more than 10,000 adolescent treatment admissions. Using this rich data and a powerful new casual modeling technique for time-varying treatments, marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting, we propose four new aims: (1) Estimate the treatment effects of different levels of care on drug use and other outcomes observed while youths remain in treatment; (2) Estimate the causal effect of cumulative treatment experiences of different levels of care on 1-, 2-, and 6-year drug use and other outcomes; (3) Estimate how baseline and time-varying client characteristics moderate the concurrent and cumulative effects of level of care on recovery and substance use outcomes; and (4) Develop and evaluate statistical methods required for Aims 1 to 3, and compare findings to those produced using conventional treatment research methods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to determine causal effects of treatment services for adolescents on drug use and other outcomes using powerful, new causal modeling techniques that allow us to study the concurrent effects of treatment, the cumulative effects of multiple treatment episodes, and differential effects for subgroups of clients. To accomplish this objective, we will use a large set of adolescent treatment outcomes data that has been collected by RAND, the Center on Substance Abuse Treatment, and Chestnut Health Systems, which includes treatment outcomes and treatment histories for more than 15,000 adolescent treatment admissions. By pursuing this research, we will improve the measurement and understanding of the effects of treatment and develop and disseminate more relevant and robust causal modeling approaches to substance abuse treatment services research than are currently standard in the field, thereby addressing key goals set by the 2004 Blue Ribbon Commission Task Force on Health Services Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During a typical influenza season, influenza A viruses primarily cause mortality in the very young and old; conversely, pandemic influenza viruses, including the 1918 H1N1 subtype and avian H5N1 viruses, cause high rates of mortality in young adults (ages 18-40) in addition to children and the elderly. During the 1918 epidemic, death rates were significantly higher among men than women. Conversely, in 2006, human cases of H5N1 avian influenza were significantly higher among young women than men. Whether gender differences in mortality from influenza virus infection during pandemics are due to dimorphic exposure or susceptibility to infection has not been resolved. To date, there are no reports of systematic examination of gender differences in response to influenza A viruses in either humans or animal models. The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop an animal model that enables us to test the hypothesis that gender differences in susceptibility to influenza virus infection reflect differential regulation of inflammation and development of immunopathology. Preliminary data from my laboratory reveal that following intranasal inoculation with the virulent mouse-adapted influenza A virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8; H1N1), morbidity and mortality are higher in female than male C57BL/6 mice. Our data further indicate that this dimorphism is dependent on circulating sex steroid hormones. We hypothesize that induction of excessively high proinflammatory responses to influenza virus infection may lead to immunopathology and death in females. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that gender differences in the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses are associated with sex steroid hormones, production of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and signaling through the Myd88 pathway. Specific Aim 2 will establish whether the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cell responses during infection, specifically responses of regulatory T cells and IL-17-producing T cells, differs between the sexes and is altered by sex steroids during influenza A virus infection. The studies proposed will provide a comprehensive examination of innate and adaptive immunological factors mediating gender differences in inflammatory responses to influenza which will serve as an important consideration for pandemic preparedness. Development of the proposed animal model for systematic examination of gender-specific responses to influenza also will translate into testable hypotheses for the determination of gender differences in responses to influenza A virus infection and vaccination in humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The burden of influenza as a global infectious disease is well recognized; missing from current initiatives is an understanding of the causes of gender differences in susceptibility to infection. Preliminary data from my laboratory reveal that following infection with virulent influenza A virus, morbidity and mortality are higher in female than male mice and we hypothesize that induction of excessively high proinflammatory responses to influenza virus may lead to immunopathology and death in females. The studies proposed will provide essential information about immune regulation in males and females, which may impact our understanding of infection as well as vaccine efficacy in different populations-a critical consideration for pandemic preparedness.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  To meet the dual threats of emerging infectious diseases and engineered biowarfare/bioterror agents, there is a pressing need for more efficient systems for vaccine development. TRIAD, or the Translational Immunology Research and Accelerated [Vaccine] Development program, based in the Biotechnology Program at the University of Rhode Island, has pioneered the development and application of an integrated  gene to vaccine  in silico, in vitro and in vivo vaccine design program to address this need. TRIAD has selected Category A pathogens F. tularensis, Category B agents Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, and emerging infectious diseases (HCV, H. pylori, tick borne diseases) as the focal point of this proposal. Using the TRIAD immunoinformatics Toolkit, TRIAD investigators will pursue the development of second generation epitope based immunme-derived vaccines for these pathogens, while addressing the failings of prior generations of epitope based vaccines. We will maximize payload quantity using validated immunoinformatics tools that permit selection of optimal T cell epitopes that are highly conserved and immunogenic. We will ensure payload quality by choosing epitopes that demonstrate antigenicity in human PBMC as well as protection in established murine models of disease/infection. We will select a combination of promiscuous Class II epitopes, and Class I supertype epitopes will provide >99% coverage of human populations. We will avoid cross-reactive epitopes and explore the role of regulatory T cells in the context of improving vaccine design. Where appropriate, we will combine our epitope-driven vaccines with broad-spectrum anti-LPS vaccines. We will optimize payload, delivery, formulation, and adjuvanting by exploring a range of delivery options [Dendritic cells, DEC205, DNA, electroporation, mucosal delivery). The TRIAD project aims to develop vaccines demonstrating broad spectrum activity include crossprotective and multiple component vaccines, and delivery technologies that have the potential to be effective against multiple emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Our efforts to merge rational design with recent advances in vaccine delivery will manifest in a coordinated toolkit and a cadre of informed users, who will be ready and able to apply the tools to discover new treatments for emerging infectious disease and biodefense.     RELEVANCE:  The Translational Immunology Research and Accelerated [Vaccine] Development (TRIAD) consortium will join forces to accelerate the development of safer, more efficient vaccines for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases. The TRIAD will also support the development of vaccine design methods that significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring medical countermeasures to market.    PROJECT 1: Multi-intracellular Pathogen Epitope-based Vaccine (De Groot, A)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the context of this proposal, we will use pre-existing defined epitopes for Francisella tularensis (FT), and using the core TRIAD vaccine design toolkit, define new epitopes for Burkholderia pseudomallei (BPM) and Burkholderia mallei (BM), the agents of meloidosis and glanders, respectively, for use in an epitope-based multipathogen prophylactic vaccine. FT has been listed as a Category A biological warfare agent as a result of World War II and Cold War-era biowarfare research. BPM, the etiological agent of meloidosis, is responsible for an estimated 20% of septicemias and approximately 40% of deaths due to bacterial sepsis in tropical regions of the world. BM, a related bacterium, also causes fatal infections (classified as glanders) in man and animals. Like FT, BM is highly infectious as an aerosol. All three pathogens (FT and BPM/BM) are intracellular bacteria and thus amenable to attack by cell-mediated immune response. The EpiMatrix epitope-based vaccine design platform has already yielded a prototype F. tularensis Type A (subsp. tularensis: SCHU S4) vaccine that confers 60% protection against heterologous lethal respiratory challenge with the live vaccine strain (LVS), an attenuated subsp. holarctica derivative. To our knowledge no subunit vaccine for tularemia has achieved a comparable level of protection in this well-developed lethal respiratory challenge model. This milestone was reached over the course of a 24 month funding period. The same vaccine design tools, made available in the context of this U19 program project, will facilitate the development a novel combined vaccine against the three pathogens. We will test the combined vaccine components, and optimize dose, delivery vehicle, and adjuvants, in a live challenge model. In addition to evaluating our epitope-driven vaccine, we will explore whether combining our FT/BPM/BM multi-pathogen vaccine with the anti-LPS vaccine developed by Dr. Steven Opal and colleagues will lead to improved protection against live challenge. The challenge studies will be carried out at NERCE in collaboration with Brown University (Steve Gregory, Steve Opal) investigators. This milestone-driven program will lead to proof-of-principle (evidence for protection against live challenge) and development of a licensable multi-pathogen biodefense vaccine within a five year time frame.     RELEVANCE: Fransicella tularensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are included on the list of Category A (FT) and B bioterrorist agents (BPM, BM) due to concern about their potential for weaponizaton. Development and licensure of effective and safe vaccines for these biowarfare threats remains a valid but unmet NIAID and DoD objective.',\n",

The Center provides centralized services and coordination for the research.         PROJECT 1:  Human CD8+ and CD4+ T Cells Responses to Influenza Infection and Vaccination (TERAJIMA, M)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to define the human T-cell responses to influenza infection and to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) in younger and older adults. We hypothesize that (1) human T-cell responses in younger adults will be greater than those in older adults to vaccination and to infection, (2) human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses will be lower to vaccine than to infection and (3) the TlV-induced T-cell responses will correlate with the amount of internal proteins in the individual licensed vaccines. Influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) is a target of protective neutralizing antibodies, which are subtypespecific and vulnerable to antigenic drift. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are thought to be more subtype cross-reactive. It is clear from studies in mouse models of influenza A virus infections that T cells can provide a second important line of defense, especially in the face of marked antigenic drift or shift due to emergence of viruses with changes in HA antibody combining sites, and there are also limited clinical studies which suggest the importance of T cells for protection, especially in a high-risk elderly population. There is, however, only a limited amount of data available on human T-cell responses to influenza infection or vaccination. Importantly there appears to be more subtype cross-reactivity among influenza A virus T cell epitopes than to the antibody epitopes on HA. At present limited data suggest that current TIVs induce low to moderate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. However, we found some individuals with high T-cell responses to TIV. Recently, we and the other group also found the amount of influenza internal proteins in the TIVs differs. Despite the recommendation and use of about 100 million vaccine doses per year in the US alone, very little is known about TIVs induction of T-cell responses and nothing is known about their contribution to vaccine associated protection. In Aim 1 we propose to analyze CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to TIV vaccination in younger and older adults. In these studies, we will also compare the three US-licensed TIVs for their ability to stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and for protection (in older adults). In Aim 2 we propose to characterize CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to natural influenza infections in younger and older adults and compare them to the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses induced by TIV. These analyses may lead to approaches towards improved influenza vaccines, which can protect against new and emerging influenza virus infections including H5N1 and other non-human strains.     RELEVANCE: For efficient protection against influenza A virus infection, influenza vaccines need to induce cellular immune responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, especially in older adults. Despite the recommendation and use of about 100 million vaccine doses per year in the US alone, very little is known about cellular immune responses induced by the vaccines and nothing is known about their contribution to protection, which we propose to study in younger and older adults to help design better influenza vaccines.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 1 out of every 5 Americans is infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Localized genital infection by HSV-2 results in painful recurring genital lesions while disseminated infection can involve multiple visceral organs and lethal encephalitis. Using Phase 1 funding we have developed a new heterologous immunization protocol composed of a glycoprotein D (gD) DNA vaccine followed by a liposome-encapsulated gD boost. This protocol induces robust serum IgG antigen-specific antibodies, mucosal IgG and secretory IgA and a T helper type 1 (Th1)-biased immune response. Mice immunized with this protocol are protected from disease after infection with 100 times the lethal dose of virus. Use of a higher priming dose of DNA revealed sterilizing immunity in 80% of immunized mice. We are requesting Phase 2 funding to complement and extend the studies in preparation for preclinical safety testing. The requested funding will be used to further characterize immune mediators induced by the novel HSV-2 vaccine. Funding will also be used to evaluate commercial suppliers of vaccine components and establish quality control parameters. Dosing of components will be further optimized in preparation for human use and toxicity testing. Guinea pigs will be used to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine in a second animal model and to test the ability of the vaccine to prevent establishment of latency and/or reactivation of latent virus. The end result of these experiments will be the establishment of a novel vaccine for HSV-2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This vaccine would clearly have an impact on the greater than $1.6 billion spent annually on direct medical costs associated with HSV-2. The Public Health Service (PHS) has recognized the significant public health issues caused by herpes simplex virus.

These projects are designed to explore the role of innate immune cells (notably natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cell/macrophages) and their products in regulating the development of effector CD8 + T cells which can efficiently eliminates virus/virus infected cells and control excess and potentially injurious inflammation associated with T cell recognition of viruses at different sites of infection. The Specific Aims of the Program fulfill several of the stated Aims of the RFA including understanding and defining the role of innate immune cells in regulating adaptive responses at different sites of virus infection.' This Program also deals with a topic as important as effective virus clearance that is the control of tissue inflammation and injury and explores the contribution of intrinsic mechanisms of control of tissue inflammation and injury exhibited by effector CD8 + T cells (i.e. effector T cell derived I L-10 and inhibitory NK receptor expression by the effector T cells). The Program brings together project leaders with unique expertise and diverse and complementary skills in the areas of Viral Immunology, Mammalian Genetics, Virology and Clinical Medicine. The individual Project Leaders and Core Directors have both prior and ongoing collaborations. In this program we proposed to examine the following questions: How does I L-10 (interleukin-10) produced by antiviral CD8 + effector T-cells affect virus clearance and control lung inflammation in acute respiratory virus infection and what factors control the production of this regulatory cytokine by effector T-cells (Project 1)?; 2. What is the nature of the defect in the CD8 + T-cell effector response to hepatotropic virus infection and adaptive immune induction in the liver and how do liver NK cells (and liver dendritic cell-NK cell interactions) regulate the magnitude and the quality of the CD8 + T cell response (Project 2)7; 3. How does NK cell mediated control of early virus replication at the site of infection in a secondary lymphoid organ i.e. the spleen, and the activation state of the NK cells, affect virus elimination and the tempo and quality of the antiviral CD8 + T cell response (Project 3)?; 4. What are the factors that control the expression of an inhibitory NK-type receptor NKG2A on CD8 + effector T cells and how does that engagement of this inhibitory receptor control excess Inflammation and inhibit immune pathology in the virus infected lungs (Project 4)?       PROJECT 1: lnterleukin-10 in acute respiratory virus infection (Braciale, T)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary inflammation and injury is a frequent (and, in some instances, lethal) outcome of virus infections of the respiratory tract. Respiratory virus infection triggers a coordinated response from the host innate and adaptive immune systems. The host response is essential for virus clearance and recovery, but is also a significant cause of pulmonary injury that can accompany virus elimination. Relevant recent examples of this are the immune-mediated lung inflammation/injury observed in human infections with the SARS coronavirus and the H5N1 avian influenza viruses. The long-term goal of Project 1 is to define and characterize the interactions between cells of the innate immune system i.e. dendritic cells, monocyte/ macrophage, NK cells and adaptive immune effector T lymphocytes (Te) in the process of virus clearance and in the control of inflammation/injury during experimental virus infection of the respiratory tract.     The foundation for this application is our recent and unexpected findings in the murine model of type A influenza infection that anti-viral effector T-cells (both CD4 +Te and more prominently CD8 +Te) infiltrating the infected lungs produce high levels of the anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines IL-10 during the Te response to infection and virus elimination. Furthermore, we found that blocking the effect of Te-derived IL- 10 during infection results in increased pulmonary inflammation and lethal injury. Our evidence further suggests that this Te-derived IL-10 plays a central role in controlling the level of lung inflammation/injury produced by mononuclear cells infiltrating the infected lungs in response to virus infection and the proinflammatory mediators released by virus- immune (Te). We wish to analyze the expression and regulation of IL-10 and specifically Te-derived IL-10 in the infected lungs and the impact of this cytokine on the control of virus clearance and lung inflammation/injury. The aims of Project 1 are: 1. To evaluate the cellular sources and effects of IL-10 on influenza virus infection; 2. To analyze the regulation of IL-10 production by Te during influenza infection; 3. To determine the impact of viral infection on the production of Te-derived IL- 10. The proposed studies are designed to complement ongoing related studies in Projects 2, 3 and 4.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses and their hosts have co-evolved an intricate interplay that is delicately balanced during the course of infection. The value of exploring such a natural relationship, rather than the mismatched experimental systems that currently prevail, is becoming increasingly clear. This program will focus squarely upon ectromelia virus (ECTV), a genuine mouse pathogen with several attractive properties. First, routes of transmission are similar to those of other orthopoxviridae in their natural hosts. Second, mousepox disease is remarkably similar to that of human monkeypox and smallpox. Third, some mouse strains are resistant to ECTV while others are highly susceptible, analogous to natural variations within human populations. None of this is true for vaccinia virus (VACV), an orthopoxvirus of unknown origin, frequently used in mouse models of immunity, and made all the more suspect by preliminary results presented below. Headed by three PIs with extensive experience in host defense against poxviruses, the program will comprehensively dissect the interplay between ECTV and resistant/susceptible strains of mice, referencing to VACV when appropriate. Project 1 will examine the cells and cytokines of the innate system that play critical roles in keeping the virus in check at the site of infection. Project 2 continues inspection of innate/natural immunity by examining the mechanisms by which type 1 interferons limit spread of the virus beyond the draining lymph node. Finally, Projects 2 and 3 will investigate all three major arms of the adaptive immune system to understand how they defend against primary infection and establish protection from subsequent challenge. All three projects will examine strategies by ECTV to thwart these different levels of host defense. Administrative, Biological Reagent, and Imaging Core Components will provide a wide range of support to the program, with the latter two carrying out their own exploratory projects. Our goal with this hypothesis-driven, highly interactive program is to develop an understanding of virus-host relationships that provides a framework for many other natural virus infections.       PROJECT 1: THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO MOUSEPOX AT THE SITE OF INFECTION (Norbury, C)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During a natural virus infection small doses of infectious virus are deposited at a peripheral infection site and then a  race  ensues, in which the replicating virus attempts to  outpace  the host's immune system. In the early phases of infection, the innate immune system must contain the infection prior to the development of an adaptive response. In Project 1 we will examine the mechanisms that are used by the innate immune system to contain infection with mousepox, a lethal mouse disease caused by ectromelia virus (ECTV), an exclusive mouse pathogen. This system is unique because it allows us to examine the innate response in susceptible and resistant mouse strains. The three Specific Aims will examine the cells that are required to slow the systemic spread of ECTV at the site of infection, the chemoattractants that mediate their migration to the site of infection and the cell biological mechanisms that are used by both the virus and the immune system during virus-cell interaction. In Aim 1 we will characterize the cellular infiltrate to the site of ECTV infection in resistant or susceptible mice and identify the innate immune effector cell types that are required to slow the systemic spread of ECTV and allow the development of an adaptive response that can clear the infection. In this aim we will also examine the effector functions that are required by innate immune cells to retard ECTV infection. In Aim 2 we will determine the chemokines and chemokine receptors expressed at the site of ECTV infection in resistant or susceptible mice, and the chemokines that are essential to attract innate effector cells that slow replication and spread of the virus. We will also study the role of immune modifiers of cellular migration encoded by ECTV in the innate response to the virus, and will identify the targets of these genes in vivo. In Aim 3 we will study the interaction of ECTV and innate immune cells in vitro, focusing primarily upon macropinocytosis, which has recently been described as the mode of infection of orthopoxviruses. Macropinocytosis has an important role in the sampling of extracellular solute for initiation of an adaptive immune response and we will examine its contribution to sampling of the environment for initiation of an innate response. We will also examine the trafficking to macropinosomes of TLR9, an innate receptor that is required for survival from ECTV challenge. The results from this Project will provide a comprehensive picture of the innate response to a peripheral virus infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical evaluation of epidemiological, virological, and immunological data accumulated during the last decade leads to the inevitable conclusion that HIV-1 infection must be considered primarily as a mucosal disease. The absolute majority of HIV-1 infections are encountered by the mucosal route during vaginal and anal sexual encounters, with women infected at a higher frequency than males. A number of potential mechanisms, addressed experimentally in this proposal, may be involved in the transmission of free and cell associated HIV across mucosal membranes. Penetrating HIV-1 promptly infects subepithelial target cells (mostly CD4+ T cells), resulting in a remarkably extensive depletion of this cell population in mucosal tissues, particularly in the gut and other mucosal organs and tissues including the female genital tract. It is speculated that as a consequence of mucosal T cell depletion and the resulting breakdown of immunoregulatory mechanisms, mucosal defenses are severely impaired and environmental antigens, mainly of bacterial origin, are taken up at much higher rates and activate target cells residing in the systemic immune compartment. Furthermore, numerous studies performed in humans strongly suggest that there is a significant association between the use of progesterone-based humoral contraceptives and a markedly increased risk of HIV-1 infection. The submitted proposal represents an integrated approach focused on a unique compartment of the mucosal immune system - the female genital tract - and HIV-1 infection. Based on the individual components of this application, the overall specific aims of the entire proposal will address: 1) the immunobiology of HIV-1 entry and infection in the female genital tract with respect to the identification of cells and their receptors involved in HIV-1 entry and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, and the role of antibodies in the prevention of HIV-1 infection; 2) marked alterations of humoral responses in the female genital tract with respect to the unexpected paucity of HIV-1-specific IgA responses in infected women, and HIV-1-induced changes in T and B cells with respect to the expression of mucosal and systemic lymphocyte homing receptors; and 3) the impact of progesterone-based contraceptives on mucosal immunity in HIV-1- infected women. The success of these studies is dependent on accessibility to suitable cohorts of women, as specified and described in the Core B section of this proposal.   RELEVANCE: The understanding of the biological and immunological consequences of HIV infection on the female genital tract and the effects of hormonal contraception on HIV infection and disease progression is limited. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved in viral entry, immunological, and hormonal interactions in HIV infected and uninfected women will provide critical insight, with implications in the design of strategies for the prevention of new infections and the reduction of HIV-associated morbidity and mortality in women.       PROJECT 1: Immunobiology of HIV-1 Entry and Infection in the Female Genital Tract   (Project Leader:  Smith, P)    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The immunobiology of HIV-1 infection in the female genital tract involves three major events: (a) Entry through the mucosal epithelium; (b) Infection and subsequent replication in subepithelial mononuclear cells; and (c) Delivery to lymph nodes to initiate systemic infection. To dissect these events, studies of macaque and human genital tissues have yielded variable results, likely because multiple cells may be involved in the events. Moreover, microbicidal agents that block SIV infection in macaques fail to block, or even enhance, infection in women, underscoring the urgent need for an effective mucosal vaccine. Importantly, because women may also acquire HIV-1 through rectal exposure, an effective vaccine for all at-risk women needs to block HIV-1 entry and infection in both genital and rectal mucosa. Using a mucosal explant system and purified mucosal cells, this proposal will elucidate the immunobiology of HIV-1 entry and infection and characterize the effect of anti-HIV-1 antibodies and progesterone-based hormonal agents on these events in genital and rectal mucosa. The proposal is driven by four Hypotheses: (1) HIV-1 crosses the monostratified endocervical and rectal epithelium by epithelial cell transcytosis but crosses pleuristratified ectocervical and vaginal epithelium via DCs; (2) Female genital mucosa selects the R5, genotypically restricted viruses that characterize acute HIV-1 infection; (3) In female genital mucosa, macrophages, lymphocytes and DCs are permissive to HIV-1 infection, but in rectal mucosa only lymphocytes and DCs are permissive; and (4) HIV- 1 entry and infection in genital and rectal mucosae are inhibited by IgG (and possibly IgA) anti-HIV-1 antibodies, and receptor analogs and ligands. These hypotheses will be tested with four Specific Aims: (1) Determine the cell(s), attachment molecule(s) and receptor(s) that cell-free and cell-associated R5 and X4 HIV-1 utilizes to enter the endocervical, ectocervical, vaginal and rectal epithelium. (2) Determine whether genital mucosa selects the R5 viruses that characterize acute HIV-1 infection. (3) Determine whether HIV-1 in female genital mucosa infects lymphocytes, macrophages and DCs but in rectal mucosa infects only lymphocytes and DCs. (4) Determine whether anti-HIV-1 (gp41 GalCer-binding domain, gp41, gp120) antibodies and CCR5 anti-virals block cell-free and cell-associated R5 and X4 HIV-1 entry and target cell infection in female genital and rectal mucosa.   RELEVANCE: This proposal will use primary mucosal tissues and purified mucosal cells to define the key events in HIV-1 entry and infection in human female genital and rectal tissue in the presence and absence of progesterone based hormonal agents. The ability of antibodies and anti-receptor agents to block these events will be characterized, thereby providing critical information for the development of a mucosal vaccine to prevent genital and rectal HIV-1 infection in women.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past 30 years we have developed a comprehensive multidisciplinary research program using the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) system to examine the fundamental mechanisms by which lentiviruses persist despite robust host immune responses and to evaluate experimental immunization strategies as models for HIV-1 infection and vaccine development. In the previous grant period, we demonstrated for the first time that Env variation is indeed a primary determinant of lentivirus vaccine efficacy that will need to be addressed in the effort to develop broadly protective vaccines. In the current competitive renewal application we propose to extend these studies to test our central hypothesis that EIAV Env is the primary determinant of vaccine efficacy and that effective vaccines must elicit appropriate broadly reactive immunity against diverse virus strains. Moreover, we suggest that Env antigen and its method of presentation need to be optimized to elicit enduring broadly protective immunity. Thus, the following complementary specific aims are proposed: (i) to define the Env determinants of vaccine protection and to characterize the specificity of vaccine immunity to these critical determinants, (ii) to characterize the maturation of immune responses to attenuated EIAV vaccines that is associated with the development of enduring protective vaccine immunity, and (iii) to develop and evaluate novel immunization procedures using multivalent and consensus Env immunogens for their ability to elicit broadly protective immunity to diverse EIAV strains. In the first specific aim, we will use selected chimeric Env viruses derived from two defined variant Env species that differ markedly in vaccine protection to map specific Env determinants of protection based on experimental challenge of ponies immunized with a reference attenuated EIAV vaccine. In the second specific aim, we will perform a complementary study to define the immune correlates of vaccine efficacy by characterizing the Env-specific antibody and cellular immune reponses that distinguish nonprotective and protective vaccine immunity. In the third specific aim, we will evaluate a series of vaccine modalities (attenuated virus, virus like particles, and adenovirus vectors) expressing either a mixture of variant Env species or a consensus Env for their ability to produce broadly reactive vaccine immunity and to protect against diverse Env strains of EIAV in experimentally immunized ponies. It is anticiapated that the results of these studies will provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which Env variation can circumvent protective vaccine immunity and determine the potential of alternative vaccine strategies to overcome the challenge of Env diversity in vaccine development. Thus, these EIAV studies address critical issues in AIDS vaccine research and can provide important information relevant to the design of candidate human AIDS vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of an effective and practical AIDS vaccine represents a critical need in the effort to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic. Recent advances in multiple drug therapy for HIV-1 infected patients have certainly improved the length and quality of life for patients in economically developed countries, but have had little impact on the predominant AIDS epidemic centered in developing countries in Africa and Asia with severely limited health care resources. In fact, the explosion of new HIV-1 infections being experienced in countries such as India, China, Russia, and South Africa and the failure to substantially reduce HIV-1 infections in targeted developing countries highlight the urgency of increasing AIDS vaccine efforts. We have developed a comprehensive multidisciplinary research program using the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) system to examine the fundamental mechanisms by which lentiviruses persist despite robust host immune responses and to evaluate experimental immunization strategies as models for HIV-1 infection and vaccine development. We recently demonstrated for the first time that Env variation is indeed a primary determinant of lentivirus vaccine efficacy that will need to be addressed in the effort to develop broadly protective vaccines. Thus, these EIAV studies address critical issues in AIDS vaccine research and can provide important information relevant to the design of candidate human AIDS vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the emergence of new human viral pathogens such as the SARS virus, Nipah virus, and the avian influenza viruses, the importance of investigations on the genetic basis of viral infections becomes clear. A major goal of this lab is to study the structure and function of Sendai virus proteins as they relate to viral pathogenicity. Sendai virus is a murine parainfluenza virus similar in structure to other paramyxoviruses that continue to be a major cause of human infection in modern man. Knowledge gained from studying Sendai virus may be applied to paramyxoviruses and other similar viruses that infect man and may lead to new therapeutic interventions. Wild-type (wt) Sendai virus causes a pneumotropic infection in mice. F1-R, a pantropic variant, causes a systemic infection. We previously hypothesized that the pantropism of F1-R is due to two phenotypic differences of the virus as compared to wt virus. One difference is the enhanced proteolytic cleavability of the fusion (F) protein of F1-R which we attributed to amino acid changes in F. Another difference is the microtubule disruption and subsequent viral bipolar budding in F1-R infections which we attributed to two amino acid differences in the matrix (M) protein of the virus. To prove our hypothesis we used reverse genetics to create recombinant viruses containing various combinations of theF1-R F and M mutations. The only virus that was able to form plaques and undergo multiple rounds of replication in LLC-MK2 cells in the absence of trypsin, or cause a systemic infection in mice was RRGV0, a virus containing all F1-R M and F changes. From these studies we could conclude that changes in the F and M genes of F1-R are sufficient to allow the virus to cause a systemic infection. The first specific aim is to determine what combination of mutations in F and M are required for the virus to form plaques and/or to undergo multiple rounds of replication in LLC-MK2 cells in the absence of trypsin and to correlate these phenotypes with virulence in mice. In tissue culture infections F1-R produces fewer viruses than wt virus or RGV0. RGV0 appeared to be more pathogenic to the mice than F1-R. We hypothesize that it is due to a higher rate of virus production in the infection caused by RGV0 as compared to the F1-R infection and that this is due to changes in the P and/or L genes of F1-R. The second specific aim of this project is to create variants of Sendai virus with all F1-R F and M mutations combined with F1-R mutations in the P and/or L genes. The purpose is to identify mutations in the F1-R that contribute to the decreased virus production and decreased pathogenicity of the virus. The third specific aim of this project is to determine if the decreased production of virus in F1-R infections is due to decreased replication/transcription rates, decreases in viral assembly and budding, or decreased inhibition of the host innate responses.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the emergence of new viral human pathogens from variants of viruses that infect other animals, such as the Nipah and SARS viruses and the avian influenza virus, the importance of investigations on the genetic basis of viral infections becomes clear. The studies described in detail in this proposal provide a platform to study how changes in the genes of Sendai virus, which causes a respiratory tract infection in mice, contribute to viral pathogenesis (ability to cause disease) in tissue culture cells and in mice. Studies on the molecular mechanisms of Sendai virus infections in mice are significant in that they may provide important insights on how to more effectively control similar infections in man.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The etiology of Parkinson's disease is multivariate, ranging from identified genetic mutations to strict environmental causation. Parkinson's disease can also occur following exposure to viruses, including the influenza virus. Most influenza infection in humans result in upper respiratory tract infection, but occasionally the brain is affected. At this time, there is considerable threat of a worldwide pandemic from the H5N1 strain of influenza virus, the so called  bird-flu . Previously, the great influenza pandemic of 1918, caused by an H1N1 influenza virus, affected 25-30% of the world's population, killing more than 40 million people. In the surviving population, the pandemic was linked to an outbreak of encephalitis lethargica (Von Economo's disease) followed by a spike in post-encephalic Parkinson's disease. Our preliminary results show that the H5N1 virus is neurotropic and can infect a variety of CNS and PNS areas. However, it is not known if the H5N1 virus can induce specific neurological damage. Since the H5N1 virus has the potential to mutate and start human-to-human transmission (likely leading to worldwide pandemic flu), it is critical to examine-in a mammalian species-if this virus has the ability to contribute to postencephalic neurodegenerative disease with particular emphasis on induced parkinsonism. In this application we propose three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine the time-course for H5N1 influenza virus infection in the central, peripheral and enteric nervous systems of mice after intranasal inoculation. Here we will use immunohistochemical detection of H5N1 virus to map the presence of H5N1 at 1, 3, 7, 10, 21, 28, 60 and 90 days following intranasal administration of H5N1. We will also examine what cells get infected by H5N1 (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, epithelial cells) as well as determine how the virus enters the nervous system. Specific aim 2 will empirically determine if H5N1 influenza virus infection results in a loss of SNpc neurons or depletion of dopamine in its target the striatum as well as if the presence of H5N1 induces an immunological reaction, and Specific Aim 3 will determine if prior CNS infection with H5N1 influenza virus increases the sensitivity to the parkinsonian toxin MPTP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are great uncertainties about the timing, virulence, and general scope of a future human influenza pandemic. However, H5N1 has recently demonstrated considerable pandemic potential. There are 3 characteristics that a pandemic influenza strain must have: 1) it must be a new strain of influenza virus never seen in human populations before 2) it must be able to replicate and cause diseases in humans 3) it must transmit efficiently from human to human. H5N1 already meets the first 2 characteristics. Additionally, it is now spreading worldwide through avian populations, possibly becoming endemic in many regions and thereby increasing the risk of human exposure. If an H5N1 human pandemic were to occur, the impact on human populations would be enormous. Estimates of projected casualties vary tremendously, from 2 to 360 million worldwide, depending on assumptions about the lethality of the virus which can vary greatly as the virus adapts to humans (WHO website). However, what is clear is that a significant proportion of the world's population would become infected. Based upon reports of H5N1 neurotropism, including our preliminary studies (see below), an Op-Ed in the New York Times by of Oliver Sacks become particularly prophetic 38. Here, he writes   ...we would do well to reawaken ourselves to what may be a formidable threat not only to human lives, but also to the human brain in those who will survive an H5N1 influenza infection .\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread human pathogen that causes a diverse array of diseases ranging from recurrent cold sores and genital lesions to blindness and encephalitis. The pathogenesis of HSV-1 depends both on the virus's ability to replicate and its ability to spread. The HSV-1 VP22 protein, encoded by the UL49 gene, has been shown to play an important role in both virus production and spread. Our studies show a UL49-null virus possesses an intriguing and unusual phenotype -- that of normal protein synthesis at early times in infection followed by a synchronous and nearly-global shutdown in protein synthesis at late times in infection. The defect is in protein synthesis and not protein stability. This same virus possesses a defect in the accumulation of a subset of viral mRNAs at early times in infection. The defects in protein synthesis and mRNA accumulation are distinct and separable with regards to both timing during infection and the genes affected. As these findings are novel, nothing is known regarding the mechanisms by which VP22 regulates protein synthesis at late times and mRNA accumulation at early times in infection. The data obtained in the proposed studies will identify those mechanisms and serve as a solid foundation for a future R01 application in which we will molecularly dissect VP22's roles in protein synthesis and mRNA accumulation. Our first aim is to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the protein synthesis shutdown observed in UL49-null virus infected cells at late times in infection. We will determine whether decreased mRNA export, decreased translation, or both are responsible for the decreased levels of protein synthesis observed late in UL49-null virus infections. We will also identify proteins that undergo decreased synthesis late in UL49-null virus infections. Finally, we will determine whether VP16 and vhs are involved in VP22-dependent protein synthesis. VP22, VP16, and vhs form a complex and secondary mutations that alleviate the UL49-null virus-associated spread defect frequently occur in vhs. Thus, we hypothesize VP22 acts in concert with VP16 and/or vhs to regulate protein synthesis and will test this hypothesis through targeted mutational analyses. Our second aim is to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the decreased steady-state mRNA levels observed at early times in UL49-null virus infections. We will determine whether increased mRNA degradation, decreased transcription, or both are responsible for the decreased steady-state mRNA levels observed early in UL49-null virus infections. We will perform HSV-1 microarray studies to identify mRNAs present in decreased levels early in UL49-null virus infections. Finally, we hypothesize that VP22 acts to increase mRNA accumulation early in infection by modulating the activity of vhs, either independently or in concert with VP16. We will test this hypothesis through targeted mutational analyses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a widespread human pathogen that causes a diverse array of diseases ranging from recurrent cold sores and genital lesions to blindness and encephalitis. The pathogenesis of HSV-1 depends both on the virus's ability to replicate itself and its ability to spread. The studies proposed herein will enable us to elucidate mechanisms utilized by HSV-1 for virus replication and spread as a prerequisite to the development of improved therapeutics for use in attenuating the above diseases.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goals of this line of research are to develop innovative methods to treat cigarette smokers, and to understand the processes related to smoking and relapse. The proposed research is based upon a chronic disorder model of cigarette smoking that suggests that long-term treatment targeted at relapse precipitants may be useful. Based on this model, we have developed a relapse prevention treatment that uses a cognitive-behavioral framework to intervene on five areas important in relapse prevention, according to the 2000 Practice Guidelines. These areas are fluctuating motivation, depression, withdrawal, weight gain, and social support. [Data] from this line of research and [preliminary data from a] related line of research (Maintaining Abstinence in Chronic Cigarette Smokers, R01 DA015732) suggest that this targeted relapse prevention treatment provided over a one year period can produce CO-verified abstinence rates of [over 50%]. These high rates are maintained at a two year follow-up. It is important to extend these findings from a smoking research clinic to a health care setting, using recruiting procedures, personnel, and patient populations prototypical of health care settings. There is also a need to extend them to smokers with a range of medical and psychiatric disorders. Last, it will be useful to establish the effects of the targeted relapse prevention intervention on abstinence over and above those obtained with extended nonspecific supportive treatment [based on a Health Education model]. Thus, the proposed research will test a series of hypotheses about the efficacy of targeted relapse prevention treatment in relation to extended nonspecific treatment and brief treatment. Participants (N=360) are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. All participants, smokers of e10 cigarettes per day, receive 12 weeks of combined pharmacological treatment (varenicline) and group psychological intervention. During the 40 week extended treatment period, participants will receive either: (1) 40 weeks of varenicline availability + Relapse Prevention Treatment (Relapse Prevention + varenicline); (2) 40 weeks of Relapse Prevention Treatment (Relapse Prevention); (3) 40 weeks of Extended Nonspecific Treatment [based on a Health Education model (Extended Nonspecific) ]; and (4) No further treatment (Brief Treatment). Participants will be assessed at baseline on smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, depression diagnosis, alcohol problems, demographics, mood disturbance, treatment support, stress, health status, motivation for change, and licit and illicit drug use. At weeks 12, 24, 52, 64, and 104, participants will be assessed on self-reported smoking verified by carbon monoxide and cotinine assays, as well as on psychometric measures. The primary hypotheses, which posit differences between conditions, will be evaluated by GEE using intent to treat analysis. We will also test a series of secondary hypotheses that evaluate a series of moderating and mediating variables to determine more precisely how treatment is related to abstinence. If this research is successful, it will provide a treatment that produce abstinence rates considerably higher than those obtained from those currently available.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project evaluates a new treatment for cigarette smokers. In two studies to date, this treatment has produced very high abstinence rates at long-term follow-up. In the current study, we will determine whether it is the content of the treatment, or the increased contact time. We will evaluate the intervention with smokers typical of those seen in a primary care setting. We will also determine whether the abstinence rates obtained in with this treatment are enhanced by adding a new smoking treatment adjunct, varenicline. Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States and innovative treatment methods are much needed. The proposed research will contribute to the development of new treatments and their assessment.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses, such as the 1918 influenza virus that caused the most devastating outbreak of an infectious disease on record. In particular, we are asking two questions: (i) how likely is the emergence of a pandemic strain comparable to the 1918 virus?; and (ii) what are the molecular features that accounted for the unprecedented virulence of the 1918 virus? Our studies have revealed that avian influenza virus genes that encode 1918 virus-like proteins still exist in nature, suggesting that 1918-like pandemic viruses may emerge in the future. In Aim 1, we will therefore assess the risk for the emergence of 1918 virus-like pandemic influenza viruses. To assess this risk, we have generated a 1918-like avian influenza virus comprising avian influenza viral segments that encode 1918-like proteins. We will introduce 1918 viral amino acids into this virus to identify changes that are critical for pathogenicity. In a parallel approach, we have generated mutant 1918 viruses in which one gene at a time is replaced with its closest avian relative (as determined by protein homology). The introduction of 1918 amino acids into the 'avian' gene/protein will reveal amino acids that are critical for 1918 virus pathogenicity. We and others have identified the HA gene as an important determinant of the unprecedented virulence of the 1918 influenza virus. The HA protein carries out two critical functions in the viral life cycle - receptor-binding and fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Currently, it is not known if the 1918 HA protein differs in its receptor-binding properties and/or fusion kinetics from contemporary human viruses, and if potential differences contributed to the high virulence of the 1918 virus. In Aim 2, we will therefore test whether the 1918 HA protein differs from that of contemporary human viruses in its receptor-binding properties. These features may be affected by the HA glycosylation pattern, prompting us to test the significance of the atypical 1918 HA glycosylation pattern for virulence. In addition, we will characterize the fusion kinetics of the 1918 HA protein, with particular emphasis on the characterization of a previously unrecognized histidine patch in the 1918 HA protein that is thought to affect fusion. In addition to the HA gene, the viral replication complex has been identified as a determinant of host range and pathogenicity. Our preliminary data also suggest a role for the 1918 virus replication complex in the virulence of the 1918 virus. However, the exact contributions of the components of the replication complex to increased virulence and the underlying mechanisms (including effects on host cell responses) are currently unknown, a gap in knowledge that we propose to fill in Aim 3. Collectively, these studies are designed to address two critical questions in influenza virus research - why was the 1918 virus highly pathogenic, and what is the risk for emergence of another 1918-like virus? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our long-term goal is to understand the likelihood of the emergence of 1918-like pandemic influenza viruses, and the mechanisms that accounted for the unprecedented virulence of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Such knowledge will help us to prepare for future influenza pandemics and to quickly recognize influenza virus strains with pandemic potential.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Foodborne and waterborne picornaviruses such as enterovirus 71 are a global health issue. Neurologic complications associated with neurovirulent non-polio picornavirus infection are a serious ongoing health problem, especially in children. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of picornavirus-induced injury to the central nervous system (CNS) are unclear. We propose that the innate immune response is an important cause of neuron death during acute infection. This is in contrast to the prevailing hypothesis that neuron loss is mediated solely by virus. While we do not doubt that some neurons die directly as the result of viral infection, our preliminary findings suggest that certain populations, such as CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, are killed by the innate immune response rather than by the virus. We have established a mouse model of picornavirus infection of the CNS using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus to directly test the role of neutrophils in the initiation of neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary evidence indicates that during acute picornaviral infection of the CNS, many uninfected CA1 pyramidal neurons undergo apoptotic death associated with oxidative injury, calpain activity, and caspase activity; this injury severely reduces cognitive performance in a spatial memory test. We have further observed that neutrophils infiltrate the hippocampus within hours of infection. Reduced neutrophil infiltration is neuroprotective, while adoptive transfer of activated neutrophils into mice with a defective neutrophil response induces hippocampal injury. Finally, treatment with calpain inhibitors protects hippocampal neurons from death and preserves cognitive function without constraining the inflammatory response that is necessary to mediating host defense and viral clearance. On the basis of these observations we hypothesize that neutrophils kill hippocampal neurons via a calpain-dependent mechanism during acute picornaviral infections of the CNS. We intend to address the following experimental questions: 1) are neutrophils necessary and sufficient to kill hippocampal neurons?; 2) is calpain the key executioner of hippocampal neurons during death induced by the neutrophil response to acute CNS infection? We propose several innovations, including the use of live animal imaging and adoptive transfer of neutrophils, to address these questions. The key concept of our proposal is that while inflammation critically mediates host defense to virus infection, the inflammatory response may indirectly kill neurons, and therefore therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing neuronal death without thwarting inflammatory control of virus may preserve host function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Certain foodborne and waterborne viruses have the ability to infect the brain. Although adults are susceptible, children are at particular risk for such neurovirulent infections. We have evidence from a mouse model that cognitive function is lost concomitantly with the death of hippocampal neurons. We also have evidence that this neuronal death is caused by a specific population of immune cells called neutrophils that are trying to clear the virus from the brain. Importantly, we have found that treatment with an FDA-approved drug protects neurons and cognitive function without altering the ability of the immune system to clear the virus from the brain.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although a considerable body of research indicates that prison-based treatment followed by continuing treatment in the community is effective in reducing drug abuse and crime among drug-abusing offenders, the impact of providing treatment is less than optimal because offenders often fail to follow through on treatment referrals, leave treatment early, or have poor engagement in treatment activities. In particular, participation in prison-based treatment alone is seldom effective in reducing drug use or recidivism unless it is followed by participation in community treatment. For correctional systems that provide a continuum of care model from prison to community, low rates of admission and retention result in poor outcomes and poor resource utilization. One way to address this problem is to provide incentives to parolees for community treatment participation. Although research supports the effectiveness of behavioral reinforcement, mainly in the form of contingency management (CM), for general substance abuse populations, CM has not yet been tested or adapted for use in community-based programs for offender populations, particularly to encourage treatment attendance. The UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs (ISAP), in collaboration with Walden House and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, is proposing a five-year health services research study that will involve a randomized test of the use of incentives with parolees in a community-based TC to increase treatment admission and treatment retention, and thereby increase the likelihood of improved outcomes. Study participants will be recruited from clients in a prison-based treatment program who have a referral to the Walden House community program. The Admission Phase of the study assesses the effect to fan incentive (voucher) on enrolling in the Walden House program. The Attendance Phase assesses the effect of incentives on treatment attendance and on post-treatment drug use, crime, and psychosocial behaviors. The intervention will last for six months. Study participants will be interviewed at baseline and at 12 months following the intervention. Treatment and criminal justice data will be obtained. Data on acceptability, satisfaction, and sustainability will be collected from focus groups with staff and clients. The study has four specific aims: (1) Determine whether offering an incentive (voucher) increases admission to community treatment by parolees who have participated in prison treatment. (2) For parolees who enter community treatment, determine whether providing incentives for attendance results in greater retention in treatment. (3) Assess the long-term impact of the use of incentives on drug use, crime, and psychosocial outcomes at 12 months following the end of the six-month intervention. (4) Assess issues of acceptability, satisfaction, and sustainability of the use of incentives to increase admission and retention among staff and clients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  If the results of the study are positive, the CM intervention would provide community treatment programs and correctional treatment systems with an effective, moderate-cost technique to promote enrollment in and attendance at community treatment and thereby improve public health and public safety through reductions in drug use and crime and improvements in psychosocial functioning.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The past four years of NIH/NIDA support has enabled a highly successful translational research study of acute hepatitis C virus HCV infection in young injection drug users (IDU), and this application proposes to build on and expand our scientific aims. HCV remains a problematic human pathogen; it is the most common blood borne infection in the U.S. It chronically infects up to 170 million people worldwide and causes an estimated 460,000 deaths per year, primarily due to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular cancer. Young IDU comprise the population most at risk and with the highest incidence rates (10-40%). Current treatments cure only ~50% and are too toxic for many patients; new ones are likely to have the same limitations. A protective vaccine is plainly needed to prevent productive HCV transmission in at-risk groups. Better understanding of the natural history, detailed correlates of protective immunity, and host genetic factors which impact acute HCV infection (within the first 12-24 weeks after inoculation) is likely to provide the necessary guide for vaccine and therapeutic development. For the majority of persons that are infected, the acute phase lasts six months; and those that remain viremic beyond six months will remain chronically infected. Accurate analyses of the rate, time-course, and immunological predictors of viral clearance in natural HCV infection, have been limited by the relative lack of acute cases available for prospective scientific study as well as lack of generalizability to the population most at risk (IDU). In the past four years, we have characterized acute HCV infection outcomes, clearance rates, transmission dynamics in injecting partners, immunological correlates (HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cellular responses) of clearance, and acute HCV treatment candidacy. This application seeks a five-year renewal to continue and expand our multidisciplinary investigation of acute HCV infection. Our prospective study of 95 acute HCV infections has confirmed and shown robust associations between gender and HCV infection, with females clearing HCV at three times the rate of their male counterparts. Gender has been vastly understudied with respect to HCV infection (and other infections). We have also shown a cycle of recurring infection followed by clearance, demonstrating immune responses may potentially protect from persistent chronic infection. We will examine the effect of gender in more depth, and assess whether gender differences in clearance and reinfection and reclearance are explained by differences in lipid profiles, genetics, immunological responses, and/or injecting behaviors. We will continue the study of transmission dynamics in HCV discordant injecting partnerships to examine transmission events and quantify infectivity, examine the effect of viral load on infectivity and to examine whether susceptibility to infection may differ by gender. We will expand our immunological studies to examine both innate and adaptive cellular immune responses to include NK/T and Tregs. Finally, we add a significant new aim, to study host genetics; assessing the impact of gender-specific polymorphisms in the HCV co-receptor SR-BI on host lipoprotein response to HCV infection. All of these studies will expand the depth and breadth of knowledge regarding acute HCV infection and clearance, including host control of HCV, overall and by gender, to inform improved vaccine designs and potentially therapeutic approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks a five-year renewal to continue and expand our multidisciplinary investigation of acute HCV infection in young injection drug users. A protective vaccine is urgently needed to prevent productive infection of this most common blood borne virus. Better understanding of the natural history, detailed correlates of protective immunity, and host genetic factors which impact acute HCV infection will guide development of such. We have shown that women clear HCV infection at three times the rate of men, yet gender has been highly understudied with respect to HCV infection. In our prospective study of young IDU (the UFO Study) recurring infection and clearance events demonstrate that successful immune responses can be elicited. This study offers a unique opportunity to study gender differences in epidemiological, immunological and host genetic studies of acute infections prospectively. Results from this work will expand the depth and breadth of knowledge regarding acute HCV infection and clearance, and address fundamental questions of host control of HCV to inform improved vaccine designs and potentially therapeutic approaches.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses circulate in both avian and human hosts and account for annual outbreaks resulting in significant morbidity, mortality and the constant threat of a worldwide pandemic. The viruses' evolutionary success is largely credited to its capacity for evading host immunity. Viral pathogenicity itself is thought to result from the robust cellular response to infection that is rendered ineffective by the expression of virus- specific antagonistic proteins. Therefore, the success of future antiviral drug and vaccine design demands a thorough understanding of these host-pathogen interactions. Recently, an IKK-related kinase called IKK? was identified as a novel molecular determinant in the cellular response to influenza virus. Mice lacking this kinase were unable to inhibit virus replication and were thus rendered hypersusceptible to infection. These data suggest that this kinase, and the cellular pathway which it controls, serve as exciting new candidate antiviral targets. This proposal focuses on three interrelated aims to better characterize the role of IKK? and influenza virus-induced pathogenicity. The focus of Aim 1 is to identify the kinase responsible for IKK? activation following influenza-induced cytokine signaling. Aim 2 is to elucidate the function of IKK?-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1. Aim 3 is to characterize how the levels of IKK? modulate the cellular transcriptome following influenza virus infection. This proposal is thus designed to further elucidate the cellular response to influenza virus infection, to identify determinants of viral pathogenicity, and to discover novel components for use in antiviral drug and vaccine design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the ever-present global burden of influenza virus, the study of host-virus interactions can result in discoveries that have immediate impact on human health. We have discovered that IKK?, a virus- and interferon-activated kinase, induces a cellular response that is critical in controlling influenza virus replication. This application focuses on understanding IKK?-mediated anti-viral signaling in order to identify novel targets for immune modulation and the treatment of influenza virus pathogenesis.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: CSF shunt infections are extremely difficult to treat, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, repeated shunt revision surgeries, and re-infection at rates as high as 25 percent. Our understanding of appropriate treatment of CSF shunt infection is limited and, as a result, management is highly variable. A recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop highlighted a need to optimize treatment of CSF shunt infection and prevent CSF shunt re-Infection. As a pediatrician who cares for children in the inpatient setting (pediatric hospitalist), I frequently care for children with CSF shunt infection, hydrocephalus and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The research and career development aims of this proposal will focus on the conduct of multicenter longitudinal studies, which are necessary to generate adequate sample sizes to study clinical problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Central to the proposed project is the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN), a philanthropically-funded, centrally coordinated research effort between four pediatric neurosurgical hospitals. My affiliation with the HCRN offers a unique opportunity for a prospective, multicenter study of CSF shunt Infection treatment with adequate sample sizes. My career development aims Include the following: 1) expand my existing skills in data acquisition and management, 2) expand my existing skills In study design, analysis, and interpretation of results, 3) learn how to measure quality of life and psychometrics to assess long-term outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, 4) learn neurobiology methodologies to better understand emerging basic neuroscience findings, and 5) develop expertise In conducting multicenter studies. These alms will facilitate my overarching career goal- to transition to an independent physician-scientist capable of performing rigorous multicenter studies needed to improve the evidence base of Inpatient health care delivered to children with neurodevelopmental disorders.  The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that variation in medical and surgical decision-making in the treatment of CSF shunt infection results in different rates of shunt re-infections. Specific Aims include: 1) Identify patient risk factors associated with CSF shunt infection, and 2) determine the association of intravenous antibiotic duration for treatment of CSF shunt infection with CSF shunt re-infection and 3) design a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the treatment of CSF shunt infection in the HCRN.     Public Health Relevance: Children with hydrocephalus have a neurodevelopmental disorder whose principal treatment is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt placement. Shunts often require surgical revision which increases the risk of infection. CSF shunt infections lead to prolonged hospitalizations, high expenditures, repeated shunt revision surgeries, and re-infection at high rates. A recent NIH-sponsored workshop called for renewed research in hydrocephalus, including a need to optimize treatment of CSF shunt infection and prevent CSF shunt re-infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) have demonstrated in preclinical studies that they are highly immunogenic and efficacious in protecting against influenza infections. This emerging vaccine technology not only creates new vaccine candidates with alternative routes of administration (intranasal or intramuscular) but also implements a fast, flexible, and dependable cell-based manufacturing system that overcomes many of the burdens associated with the current egg production system. VLPs are structures that morphologically and biochemically mimic a wild type influenza virus, however they lack viral genetic material and are unable to replicate and cause infection; therefore chemical inactivation is not required. This better maintains the native conformation of the antigenic epitopes in the VLP vaccine. The safety of the technology allows for the development of vaccines directed against highly pathogenic influenza virus strains without the risk of disseminating infectious material. The Phase I SBIR award allowed us to create and test in preclinical studies several VLP vaccine candidates designed to protect against highly pathogenic pandemic strains of the influenza virus such as H1N1-1918; H5N1 and H7N7 avian influenza viruses. These studies have shown that VLP vaccines are immunogenic and efficacious, further proving the value of the VLP technology for influenza vaccine development. In the current application, we propose to further advance the development of these vaccine products with additional preclinical studies. We will develop a purification system for large scale manufacturing of VLP vaccines, prior to cGMP manufacturing. We will perform one comparative pilot study between a VLP vaccine produced in the insect cell/baculovirus system and the same VLP vaccine produced in stably transfected recombinant mammalian cells. Further, we aim to perform small scale cGMP vaccine production and toxicology studies for a Pre-Innovation Drug Application (IND) with the FDA. The specific aims of the Phase II SBIR are: A) To produce, characterize, and test in preclinical studies in mice the influenza-virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines designed to protect against 1) H5N1 avian influenza virus, 2) human H1N1-1918 influenza virus and 3) H7N7 avian influenza, and to perform cross protection and enhancement of immunogenicity (including in the elderly) studies as well as to develop a large scale purification method and to compare the immunogenicity of the H5N1 VLP vaccine produced in the insect cell/ baculovirus system and the same vaccine produced in a recently developed stably transformed mammalian which could be developed as a second generation VLP manufacturing system. B) To evaluate vaccine efficacy, dosage and adjuvant formulations for enhancement of vaccine potency and antigen sparing in preclinical studies in ferrets. C) Perform small scale cGMP vaccine production and toxicology studies for a Pre-Innovation Drug Application (IND) with the FDA. Completion of this SBIR Phase II will bring the VLP vaccine technology to the point of a Phase I clinical trial in humans and will advance this new vaccine product and manufacturing system towards commercialization. Although pandemic influenza VLP vaccines are being developed during this project, the outcome will validate the robustness of the technology for development of seasonal influenza vaccine which currently is burdened with prolonged production times, dependence on chicken eggs, insufficient yield with certain strains, inflexibility for accommodating newly emerging variants, and unsuitability when working with highly virulent virus, all issues where the VLP technology is superior. This SBIR Phase II will accelerate the creation of vital prophylactic vaccines (e.g. H5, H7 avian flu and 1918) and will also validate a faster, more flexible, cell-based technology for epidemic influenza vaccine production. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is a recurrent respiratory infection afflicting humans all over the world. The virus changes constantly generating new epidemic and pandemic viruses, for which vaccines are needed. Although prophylactic vaccines for epidemic strains are available, periodic updates are required to maintain protective efficacy. Vaccines for pandemic viruses are lacking and their development is critical. Here we proposed to further develop the influenza virus-like particle (VLP) technology for the generation of pandemic and epidemic influenza vaccines. This technology is fast, flexible, and reliable for creating highly effective vaccines which are manufactured in a cell-based system. The VLP vaccines system overcomes many of the problems of the egg production system. Successful development of these vaccines will benefit society globally.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research proposal is to further develop a potent oral vaccine platform that is reusable for different pathogens and can be manufactured more rapidly and at lower cost than currently available vaccine technology. Rapid production time and ease of distribution of a vaccine in pill form will provide for an effective countermeasure against influenza and other potential pandemic viruses. Studies funded by Vaxart's Phase 1 SBIR have demonstrated that an expressed Toll Receptor 3 ligand, given in conjunction with antigen expressed from a non-replicating adenovirus vector significantly augments the adaptive immune response to oral vaccination, and is protective against avian influenza challenge in large animals. An effective gene-based technology must overcome the major obstacles of pre-existing and vaccine-induced immunity to the vector if it is to be used as a general platform for multiple antigens or boosting. Our results demonstrate that the oral vaccine route effectively circumvents vaccine induced immunity problems that occur with injected vector vaccines, which will allow the vector backbone to be reused without loss of activity. In Phase II, we propose to further develop and test vaccine effectiveness, formulation and safety in preparation for clinical testing. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will test the effectiveness of our oral vaccine to protect against cross-clade avian influenza challenge. Aim 2 provides a formulation path for oral drug product development. Aim 3 validates an animal model for pre-clinical safety testing for an enterically delivered oral vaccine. Aims 4 and 5 test for the biodistribution pattern and safety profile of oral vaccine capsule administration in animals. Together, the results from these aims will provide the pre-clinical data required to begin clinical testing of Vaxart's oral avian flu vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vaxart is developing a new oral vaccination technology, which can be used to rapidly develop and manufacture effective vaccines for use against emerging pathogens including new strains of influenza virus; the technology can shorten the time from identified influenza strain to released product from 7 months to 4 months. With our flexible oral vaccine technology, genes from any pathogen can be rapidly inserted into this vaccine backbone, and manufactured into a vaccine using a highly efficient, standardized, GMP process. In addition, a significant advantage to developing a vaccine in pill form is the ease of administration in emergency situations such as pandemic, and in regions of the world that lack sufficient medical personnel.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dengue (DEN) is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection of humans with about 100 million cases and 25,000 deaths annually, threatening over 3.5 billion people worldwide. The dengue viruses cause dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), and are endemic throughout the world's subtropical and tropical regions. To date, there is no effective vaccine to prevent against DF and no drug treatment for the disease. Dengue infection is caused by one of four different RNA viruses: dengue type 1 (DEN-1), DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. For a dengue vaccine to be safe and effective, it must be capable of neutralizing all four of the dengue viruses. Inviragen's tetravalent DEN vaccine (DENVax) consists of the live attenuated DEN-2 PDK-53 virus and three chimeras expressing the structural genes (prM and E) from DEN-1, DEN-3 and DEN-4, and retaining the genetic alterations responsible for the safety of the original DEN-2 vaccine. We have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of DENVax in AG129 mice and monkeys. In these studies we have identified tetravalent formulations that induce neutralizing antibodies to all four DENV serotypes. However, the responses to DENVax-4 were limited by interference from the other, more robust chimeras. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the immune responses to the DENVax-4 vaccine construct can be further optimized through genetic manipulation of the DENVax-4 infectious clone. We propose to design and characterize a new chimeric DEN2/4 vaccine, and test the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in mice and monkeys. This proposal uniquely utilizes resources, facilities and reagents available at Inviragen Inc, CDC, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The development of an effective dengue vaccine represents an important approach to the prevention and control of this global emerging disease. Inviragen's long term goal is to develop a safe and effective dengue vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dengue virus (DEN), a mosquito-borne RNA virus, is the most important arthropod-borne viral infection of humans with about 100 million cases and 25,000 deaths annually. We are developing a safe and effective tetravalent dengue vaccine that will protect against all four dengue serotypes. Such a vaccine would protect U.S. travelers from dengue infection, and significantly improve global public health as dengue threatens over 3.5 billion people worldwide.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease and death in humans. H5N1 is spreading rapidly in bird populations world-wide and there is great concern that this virus will begin to transmit between people and cause a global pandemic catastrophe. Vaccines are the cornerstone strategy for combating avian flu but there are numerous challenges in producing the vast numbers of safe and effective doses that are needed to prevent infection and to save millions of lives. One previous effort to eliminate traditional egg-based vaccine production involved a clinical trial that tested baculovirus-derived recombinant H5 Hemagglutinin (rH5). The results showed that rH5 was safe but could only stimulate  protective  antibodies in ~50% of subjects after 2 injections. We believe the relative ease in manufacturing rH5 protein could be a very important strategy for addressing the world's vaccine stockpiling efforts if rH5 immunogenicity was improved. We also believe this is possible by combining rH5 with an innovative adjuvant that targets dendritic cell function. Here we describe straightforward proof of concept experiments where rH5 will be formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion and Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a synthetic Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR-4) agonist. Collectively, these components augment antibody responses needed for preventing viral infection, as well as stimulate T cells that limit disease progression within the host and reduce viral transmission within the population. The improved immunogenicity of this pandemic vaccine will be established following completion of three specific aims. We will produce, characterize and optimize vaccine formulations for physical integrity, stability, and GLA potency using mouse and human DC activation assays. Improvements in vaccine immunogenicity will be established in mice by measuring antigen-specific antibody responses, including those that can cross-react and neutralize H5N1 virus from different strains. Identification of a lead formulation for subsequent work will require that the GLA adjuvant can; (1) mediate a significant dose-sparing effect and maintain maximal antibody responses following a 10-fold reduction in rH5 concentration, and (2), induce long- lasting CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice. If successful, then rH5+GLA adjuvant will be tested in virus challenge models by inoculating mice and ferrets with two strains of H5N1. Viral load, disease progression and survival will be monitored, as well as adjuvant dose-sparing activity and induction of cross-reactive antibodies. Our criteria for vaccine efficacy is that GLA adjuvant will stimulate 100% survival at 1/10 the rH5 dose compared to nonadjuvanted rH5 vaccine. Moreover, the adjuvant will be cross-protective and stimulate significant survival in animals challenged with a different H5N1 virus. Successful completion of these studies will establish a method for enhancing the immunogenicity of a previously tested pandemic vaccine. This new vaccine should significantly improve stockpiling capacity and provide an important degree of protection against any newly emerging strains of H5N1. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is great international concern that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus will cause a pandemic infection resulting in millions of deaths. New vaccine technologies are need if we are to successfully prevent H5N1 infection and avert a global catastrophe. Adjuvants that stimulate dendritic cells can be used to increase vaccine potency, thereby stretching vital manufacturing capacity and protecting against newly emerging strains of H5N1 virus.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large investments have been made in the design of a vaccine that induces a cellular immune response against HIV. However, the failed Merck STEP trial showed that a lot of work still needs to be done to establish the basic immunobiology pertaining to the relationship between T cell quality, quantity, and mucosal location and viral infection. CD4 T cells are the main target for HIV pathogenesis while cytotoxic CD8 T cells are thought to be the ideal effectors to mediate viral clearance. The goal of this proposal is to determine the relationship between CD4 and CD8 T cell quantity, quality, and location and viral infection, not in a HIV model system but in a well-established mouse model of acute and chronic viral infection. Defining the behavior of these cells in mucosal tissues will be pertinant to studies in HIV/SIV infection. Aim I will focus on determining the relationships between antigen exposure, anatomic location, phenotype, and function among virus-specific CD4 T cells after lymphocytic choriomengingitis virus (LCMV) infection. I hypothesize that variables in duration and strength of stimulation influence the quality and anatomic distribution of CD4 T cells. Being that T cells are both targets for and effectors against HIV pathogenesis, the information gleaned from this aim will help us better understand the interactions between virus and target in mucosal tissues.   The production of a HIV vaccine that induces broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies has proved difficult, therefore, one solution would be to develop a CD8 T cell vaccine. However, very little is known about the ability of CD8 T cells to clear a viral infection. Aim I seeks to address the relationship between memory CD8 T cell quantity, quality and location and protection from infection. I hypothesize that in order to clear a viral infection, one must a have a threshold number of CD8 T cells at the location of primary infection. Determination of the quality, quality, and location of memory LCMV-specific CD8 T cells required for protection against infection will be determined by quantitative rtPCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Discovering the basic mechanisms by which effector and memory CD8 and CD4 T cell function in mucosal tissues following vaccination and infection is essential for the future development of a successful vaccine. This information is extremely necessary for the future development of a HIV vaccine that targets the cellular immune system.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Causes and Consequences of Child Coping during Pediatric Oncology Treatment Episodes: A Secondary Data Analysis ABSTRACT Many pediatric cancer patients experience serious psychosocial problems during and after treatment. Designing interventions to reduce these problems and improve the quality of long-term survivorship requires understanding the origins of stressors underlying these psychosocial problems. Treatment episodes (defined as the time before, during, and immediately following treatment procedures) are one of the most stressful aspects of pediatric cancer, and child long-term outcomes are rooted in the treatment experience. As a result, children's negative responses to treatment episodes may place them at greater risk for negative psychosocial outcomes after treatment. Findings from our previous NIH-funded research show that differences in parent and child attributes (i.e., trait affect, temperament, resilience), child behavior problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, somatic problems, aggression), and parent state affect and communication are associated with children's global ratings of distress during treatment episodes. However, little is known about the role of child coping behaviors during these episodes and how these behaviors might mediate these relationships. Our long-term goal is to understand how factors that exist prior to treatment episodes and interpersonal processes during episodes influence child coping, and in turn, child responses to treatment episodes (i.e., distress behaviors during episodes and quality of life post-episode). Therefore, our primary objective in the proposed study is to extend our previous research with a secondary analysis of previously video-recorded pediatric oncology treatment episodes (and related parent and child variables) to achieve the following aims: Aim #1: Further develop and refine a coding system to systematically observe and analyze child coping and distress behaviors during treatment episodes Aim #2: Apply this coding system to an existing archive of video-recorded pediatric oncology treatment episodes that include parents and children (N = 41) Aim #3: Explore and empirically test relationships between observational ratings of child coping behaviors during treatment episodes and: (a) parent and child dispositional attributes, (b) child behavior problems, (c) parent communication and affect during episodes, and (d) child distress during treatment episodes (i.e., observed ratings of specific distress behaviors; global ratings by parents, nurses, children; and observed global ratings by trained coders) and child quality of life after treatment episodes. Our overarching research goal is to develop effective interventions to reduce distress and improve quality of life for pediatric cancer patients. This goal requires an improved understanding of the causes and consequences of children's coping during treatment episodes. We expect our proposed research to provide direct, empirical evidence to inform the development of future interventions to enhance child coping, thereby reducing distress during episodes and improving the long-term quality of life for survivors and their families.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Project Narrative Previous research shows that children's cancer treatment experiences are a factor in their long-term well- being and quality of survivorship. This study seeks to better understand the causes and the consequences of differences in children's coping during treatment episodes. We will refine and apply an observational coding system to an archive of previously collected video-recordings of child treatment visits and then analyze the relationships between child coping behaviors and several child and parent factors prior to, during, and following the treatment. We expect the findings of our proposed research to provide direct evidence to inform the development of interventions to facilitate children's positive coping during treatment episodes, thereby reducing their distress during episodes and improving the long-term quality of life for survivors and their families.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 1918-20 influenza pandemic was the largest, most lethal epidemic in modern: history. It spread over the entire world in about six months and killed between 20 and 100 million people. Yet, despite such a devastating event, there is little detailed information on how and when the influenza epidemic spread throughout cities and countries in the world, especially the U.S. Because the last influenza pandemic was in 1968, the threat of a future pandemic looms large. It is, therefore, important for public health in the U.S. to not only understand the timing and spatial course of the 1918 pandemic, but to also understand how this great event might have affected the timing and spread of Influenza in non-pandemic seasons. This knowledge could inform targeted prevention strategies for a future pandemic. The proposed research seeks to use weekly mortality data from historical sources and lab surveillance data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System (NREVSS) to study the timing and spread of influenza through the U.S. during pandemic and non pandemic seasons. The first aim of this research is to develop models of the temporal and spatial aspects of influenza In the U.S. for four pandemic and non-pandemic periods: the 1918- 20 pandemic, 1914-1917 Influenza seasons, 1920-1923 influenza seasons, and 1997-2007 influenza seasons. For each influenza season, the week of the first report of influenza mortality or lab confirmation will be plotted for each city and spread vectors will be constructed from this sequence of dates. Models will also be constructed by determining the average time to death or lab confirmation for each city for each season and then constructing linear trend surfaces, which will be plotted on a separate map. The direction of the wave progression will be marked by a vector on each map. The second aim of this study is to compare the time and spatial progression of the 1918 pandemic in the U.S. with those of non-pandemic years. The U.S. will be divided into nine regions to allow for easier analysis and bi-proportionate analysis will be used to compare the spatial and temporal aspects of influenza in pandemic years with those in non-pandemic years. This method will allow the analysis of the combined space-time variability in influenza in the U.S. by standardizing the relative intensity of influenza throughout the years. The completion of these aims and these methods has broad application for disaster preparedness, such as pandemic planning and bioterrorism. Knowledge of the timing and spatial course of influenza in the U.S. could severely limit the impact of a future pandemic and allow public health professionals to more effectively utilize interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: I am currently pursuing the Kirschstein-NRSA Diversity Fellowship in order to be better prepared for a long and fruitful career in public health. I wish to become federal epidemiologist so that I can best help the nation's public health and scientific community refine the methods of infectious disease surveillance. I believe the Kirschstein-NRSA Diversity Fellowship will build upon my graduate education and provide me with the training and support I need to accomplish my above-stated goals and, consequently, become a significant future epidemiologist and scientific researcher. I expect that training from the Kirschstein-NRSA Fellowship will increase my practical application of epidemiologic methods and analysis and will allow me to gain new techniques, such as bi-proportionate analysis and spatial modeling. This fellowship will provide me with an opportunity to use surveillance data to develop methods that will not only better my understanding of the transmission process of Influenza In the U.S., but may also better the influenza surveillance system in the U.S. I believe the training from this fellowship will make me a more talented epidemiologist and I am confident that I would be a strong contributing member to the Kirschstein-NRSA graduate fellow and alumnus community as well as the overall public health community.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus is a seasonal pathogen with the potential to cause pandemic infection; it results in respiratory disease ranging from subclinical symptoms to life-threatening primary viral pneumonia. Despite the availability of a yearly vaccine, it is estimated that an average of 360,000 deaths/year can be attributed to influenza virus infection in the US alone, with severe illness occurring in approximately 3-5 million people worldwide annually. Through the use of small regulatory RNAs, we seek to further the current paradigm of influenza virus infection while developing a safe, effective, and cost-efficient vaccine strain. Influenza A virus is not only a seasonal pathogen, causing yearly epidemics, but also a potential pandemic causative agent. The development of reverse genetics technology for influenza virus has led both to the preliminary characterization of its pathogenicity, as well as to the development of novel vaccine strains. By combining reverse genetics with the newly evolving field of microRNA (miRNA) biology, we seek to further understand influenza virus infection while developing a safe, effective, and easily produced vaccine strain. Through the incorporation of miRNA response elements (MREs), corresponding to ubiquitously expressed mammalian miRNAs, into influenza A virus, we can achieve vaccine quality attenuation. Our first objective will be to characterize this phenomenon, by fully understanding the host response to these attenuated viruses, and by elucidating the viral response to these attenuating mutations. We will also improve upon this technology by identifying the most effective influenza viral transcript to target, with the ultimate goal being influenza virus vaccine design. Our second objective will be to use this new technology to investigate influenza virus tropism and cell-type contribution to viral pathogenicity. Through the use of miRNA-mediated attenuation technology, we will elucidate the role of hematopoietic-specific miRNAs in determining influenza virus tropism, and further our understanding of the contribution made by epithelial subtype populations to influenza virus pathogenicity. As such, this proposal has the potential to offer a significant contribution to human health as the strategy described here could be employed to develop effective and safe vaccines to any desired pathogen.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an orally-transmitted human herpesvirus that establishes persistent infections in almost all adults worldwide. The reservoir of virus is in a latent state in the memory B cell population but current models suggest that it is replenished by sporadic reactivation in terminally differentiating plasmablasts, amplification in epithelial cells and reinfection of the B cell pool. Long term carriage of EBV can be associated with both lymphoid and epithelial malignancies and individuals who are immunosuppressed, particularly those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are at increased risk of developing them. Part of this increased risk may reflect a loss of control of replication of virus. The role that EBV plays in tumorigenesis is complex, but seroepidemiologic studies suggest that the disturbance of the normal equilibrium and an increase in virus load precedes the appearance of malignancy. The long term goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of infection, particularly how virus traffics between B cells and epithelial cells to amplify within the host. Five EBV envelope proteins have been differentially implicated in virus entry into B cells and epithelial cells, gp350, gH, gL, gp42 and BMRF2. New work from this laboratory suggests that preneoplastic changes in epithelial cells may make them more susceptible to infection as they differentially express cell proteins important for interaction with gHgL and gp350 and activate those that can induce virus replication in adjacent B cells. Further, that a newly identified envelope protein, BDLF2, which interacts with and may be dependent on BMRF2 may be relevant to virus spread. The immediate goals of this application are to test these hypotheses. Aim one will use soluble forms of gHgL and ?v?6, cell-based fusion assays and Surface Plasmon Resonance to evaluate interactions between gHgL and ?v?6 in triggering virus-cell fusion. The possibility that additional integrins can mediate the same function will be explored, the downstream effects of gH binding to integrins on intracellular movement of virus will be examined and the expression of integrins on normal and dysplastic tissues in vivo will be determined. Aim two will explore the role that CR2 plays in increasing efficiency of epithelial cell infection. Expression of CR2 on dysplastic epithelial cells in vivo will be evaluated and the effects on infection of a gp350-stimulated interaction with formins will be determined by comparison of full length and truncated CR2. Aim three will investigate the role of the BMRF2/BDLF2 complex by making a BDLF2-null virus and a BMRF2-null virus. A virus lacking the BMRF2 RGD motif will also be made to explore unique effects of gH and BMRF2 binding to integrins. EBV is one of a several viruses associated with oral complications of HIV disease reflecting its continued replication and shedding in the oropharynx. Unraveling mechanisms by which virus is targeted to cells newly prone to infection is important to understanding pathogenesis and developing evasive strategies PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with several different malignancies and individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus are at increased risk of developing them. Part of this increased risk may represent a failure of the immune system to control EBV replication in epithelial cells. This application seeks to understand the interactions between virus and cell proteins that enable virus to enter epithelial cells and initiate replication and in doing so seeks to identify risk factors and potential novel therapeutic targets.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), together, lead to the death of more than four million people annually, world-wide. The public health system in third world faces unmitigated disaster due to the twin assault from these pandemics. The emergence of Multi Drug-Resistant (MDR) and Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the failure of Bacille Calmette- Guerin (BCG) vaccine to control the spread of TB, and our inability to develop effective anti-TB drugs has worsened this situation. Human Immune Virus (HIV)-induced immuno-suppression is a substantial contributor to TB reactivation; perhaps one-quarter of all HIV cases go on to develop active TB. The world-wide AIDS situation is equally gloomy. The frontline candidate vaccines against AIDS have failed in clinical trials. We still do not completely understand mechanisms of AIDS pathogenesis and correlates of protection. Even the advent of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has not been able to impact this situation. New drugs and vaccines are urgently needed to combat both the TB and AIDS. Robust animal models of TB, AIDS and TB-AIDS co- infection will be a crucial part of the strategy to develop and test vaccines and drugs against these diseases. It has been possible to model AIDS extremely well in rhesus macaques infected with Simian immune Virus (SIV). These macaques undergo a rapid decline in the CD4+ T cell levels in peripheral blood and various lymphoid tissues following infection, and develop chronic to acute AIDS characterized by severe immune deficiency. Infection of macaques with Mtb produces a variety of outcomes, including primary fulminate TB, chronic, slowly progressive TB, or latent infection, thus accurately recapitulating the host-driven diversity of human TB. We have recently demonstrated the capability to infect rhesus macaques with a high- or low-dose of aerosolized Mtb, producing active pulmonary TB and latent disease, respectively. The ability to infect macaques with Mtb via the aerosol route will allow us to model TB as closely as possible to natural disease. In this proposal, we would like to combine our recently developed aerosol-based model of TB in rhesus macaques, to the previously existing SIV infection model in the same species, in order to study the clinical, immunological, molecular and pathological parameters of co-infection between SIV and Mtb. Consequently, the proposal aims to achieve the following research objectives: 1. Establish a model of M. tuberculosis/SIV co- infection in rhesus macaques, mimicking the natural route of infection for both pathogens. 2. Determine if rhesus macaques latently infected with low-dose aerosols of M. tuberculosis reactivate to active disease in significantly different fashion, following intravenous infection with SIV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) and Acquired Immune Deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are two of the most devastating infectious diseases of mankind, together resulting in close to four million annual deaths. The crisis has further worsened due to a collapse of public health system in many nations, the apparent synergy between AIDS and TB, the spectacular failure of BCG (the anti-TB vaccine) and AIDS vaccines in the pipeline, and drug resistance. AIDS is caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), while TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Rhesus macaques infected with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) are an accurate model of human AIDS. This model has been instrumental in developing our current understanding of AIDS pathogenesis and pathology. There is also a renewed interest in the nonhuman primate model of TB. These animals accurately model various phases of clinical TB, and portray the entire spectrum of the pathology of human TB. We recently exposed rhesus macaques to high dose of M. tuberculosis aerosols. This led to the development of significant pulmonary TB. Exposure of rhesus macaques to a low dose of Mtb aerosols on the other hand, led to latent infection. We believe that the ability to infect NHP's with infectious aerosols of Mtb represents a significant advance, since it allows us to study the disease in a natural context. Consequently, the proposal aims to achieve the following research objectives: 1. Establish a model of Mtb/SIV co-infection in rhesus macaques, mimicking the natural route of infection for both pathogens. 2. Determine if rhesus macaques latently infected with low-dose aerosols of Mtb reactivate to active disease in a significantly different fashion, following intravenous SIV infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY: Despite years of effort, an effective vaccine for HIV remains elusive. Perhaps the greatest obstacle to designing an effective vaccine is a lack of understanding of the immune responses necessary for protection from infection and/or clearance of virus from infected hosts. Furthermore, early cellular and molecular events, particularly in mucosal tissues of HIV infected patients are poorly understood. The latter are equally critical for vaccine development, since vaccines do not prevent infection, but instead limit viral replication to the site of transmission, and prevent amplification and subsequent spread of the virus to systemic sites or target organs that can result in disease. Several years ago we demonstrated the intestinal tract is the major target for early SIV infection, viral  ramp-up  amplification, and the major site of CD4+ T cell loss in SIV infected macaques, regardless of the route of infection, and it is now generally accepted that the intestinal tract is fundamental to the pathogenesis of early HIV infection. However, considerable controversy remains with regard to the earliest virologic and immunologic events in HIV infection, and correlates of immunity to infection or disease progression, which are both critical for developing novel vaccines or immunotherapeutics for prevention or control of infection. The proposed studies will utilize the rhesus macaque model of SIV infection to address the earliest events involved in infection of the intestine, as well as the role of mucosal immunity in control of infection. The specific aims are to; 1) Determine how and when SIV reaches the gut following various routes of inoculation, and the earliest immunologic changes that accompany acute infection of mucosal tissues; 2) Determine the relative contributions of bystander apoptosis and direct viral infection and killing of intestinal CD4+ T cells in acutely infected macaques in vivo, and; 3) Identify the mechanisms of control of SIV in rhesus macaques infected with pathogenic SIV by comparing immunologic changes in mucosal and systemic tissue compartments between progressors, animals controlling infection (LTNP), and those on ART. Although tremendous advancements have been made in antiviral therapies, the rates of HIV infection continue to climb, and there are no vaccines, cures or reliable prevention strategies in the foreseeable future. Major hurdles in developing a vaccine remain in our lack of understanding of the earliest immunologic events associated with infection, as well as those associated with control of infection. The current proposal is to elucidate the earliest events in infection of mucosal tissues, and to compare mucosal and systemic immune responses in animals that are controlling infection in a relevant animal model. The ultimate objective is to discover key mechanisms involved in early infection and/or control of infection that may be exploited for developing new targets or approaches for vaccine design.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Better understanding of the primary phase of HIV infection through quantitative computational modeling is crucial for deciphering viral pathogenesis and for developing an effective vaccine, since vaccine-elicited adaptive immune responses are expected to exert their major effects on viral replication and evolution during the primary phase. Previous efforts to model this early stage of infection have been unable to fully exploit available clinical data since current models did not integrate viral replication and sequence evolution in a single framework. We will construct a model for primary HIV infection that will incorporate virus replication dynamics and viral sequence diversification simultaneously. Major innovations of our model will include (i) comprehensive integration of virologic kinetics and sequence data and (ii) invention of web-based software to visualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of HIV infection. We will then use this simulation to model vaccine- elicited effects on host immune control of HIV infection. In Aim 1, a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation illustrating both viral kinetics and sequence evolution in the primary phase of HIV infection will be constructed. The HIV provirus population of infected cells will be simulated using virologic parameters, including dynamic reproductive ratio, generation time, and reverse transcriptase single cycle error rate. In Aim 2, we apply the model to data from the NIAID-supported phase IIB evaluation of Merck's recombinant Ad5-HIV gag/pol/nef vaccine (STEP Study; Merck/HIV Vaccine Trials Network collaboration) in order to understand why this vaccine elicited HIV-specific CD8 cells in many trial participants but had no effect on virus load in those individuals who experienced breakthrough infections. We will use our model to test three hypotheses that might explain this lack of efficacy: (1) high levels of antigenic distance between the transmitted strain and the vaccine strain may have compromised vaccine efficacy (2) viral escape from vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses may have resulted in the enhancement of viral replication or (3) vaccine-related CD4+ T cell activation may have amplified virus replication, thereby offsetting the potential benefit conferred by virus- specific CD8 cells. Finally, Aim 3 will invent web-based simulation tools for prediction of vaccine efficacy using clinical data inputs. These studies are expected to result in a novel and comprehensive computational model for primary HIV infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The initial phase of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plays a crucial role in determining subsequent progression to AIDS and probing vaccine efficacy, but remains poorly understood. This project will develop a computational simulation that can be used to model this critical phase of virus infection. The model is expected to have important utility in helping to design safe and effective HIV/AIDS vaccines.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While evidence-based treatments for opioid dependence are available, only 15 percent of affected individuals receive treatment. The availability of buprenorphine, an opioid dependence treatment approved by the FDA in 2002 with similar efficacy to methadone, was expected to lead to increased treatment rates. Although treatment rates have increased somewhat, they remain alarmingly low, leaving the majority of affected individuals at risk for adverse consequences including financial hardship, under-employment, transmission of hepatitis C and HIV, impaired driving, and crime. Restrictive insurance benefits for substance abuse may partially explain low treatment rates among the 53 percent of opioid dependent individuals with private insurance. The aim of the newly-enacted federal substance abuse parity law is to equalize private coverage for behavioral and physical illnesses. This law, which will be implemented in January 2010, has the potential to substantially affect treatment patterns for opioid dependence. However, other access-related factors are also likely to be relevant. Almost no research has focused specifically on barriers to treatment among the privately insured, and these individuals may have different financial constraints, time costs, and attitudes towards treatment compared with uninsured or publicly insured opioid dependent individuals. We propose two specific aims: (1) to study the effects of federal substance abuse parity on use of opioid dependence treatment financed by private insurance and (2) to estimate the relative importance of attributes of opioid dependence treatment on privately insured individuals' decision to enter treatment. First, we will compare treatment utilization by individuals newly covered by federal substance abuse parity regulations beginning in 2010 with treatment utilization by individuals already covered under pre-existing state substance abuse parity laws. We will adapt current substance abuse identification, treatment initiation, and treatment engagement measures to compare treatment patterns for these two groups before and after federal parity implementation. Second, we will conduct an analysis of demand for treatment by eliciting opioid dependent individuals' preferences for price and non-price related treatment attributes. We will conduct qualitative interviews to identify treatment attributes that affect the decision to enter treatment. Next, we will field a web-based survey of treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking opioid dependent individuals with private insurance to elicit information on the relative value of different treatment attributes and to estimate how improvements in treatment options will affect treatment rates. Both the IOM Report Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental Health and Substance- Use Conditions and NIDA's 2004 Blue Ribbon Task Force on Health Services Research identified a pressing need to improve receipt of effective services in real world settings. To transform care for opioid dependence, it is vital to identify the effects of both benefit expansion and attributes of treatment on utilization rates.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Opioid dependence is a major public health concern in the United States, with economic costs estimated at $21 billion per year. While evidence-based treatments for opioid dependence are available, only 15 percent of affected individuals receive treatment. With the goal of increasing treatment rates, this project aims to evaluate the effects of federal parity on rates of use for opioid dependence treatment and to estimate how improving treatment options will affect rates of use among the 53 percent of opioid dependent individuals with private insurance.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, cervical cancer rates have declined in recent years, however ethnic and minority groups remain disproportionately affected. In Brooklyn, New York, an area with large immigrant populations and ethnically diverse communities, cervical cancer rates are significantly higher than national rates with some communities doubling the national incidence rate. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and it is estimated that 6.2 million persons are newly infected every year. Although most infections with HPV are asymptomatic and self-limited, persistent infection with genital HPV infection can cause cervical cancer. Approximately 100 HPV serotypes have been identified; however there are two high-risk serotypes, HPV-16 and HPV-18 that cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine was licensed for use in the United States for females aged 9-26 years for prevention of HPV infection (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and related cervical cancer in 2006. To date, most studies have focused on patient and parental barriers to vaccine acceptance. This study is unique in that it focuses on another key stakeholder in the HPV vaccine initiative- the physician and specifically those serving high risk populations. Physicians are often the primary and first source of information for parents and patients regarding vaccine awareness and knowledge. As such, the aims of this study are 1) To assess the self-reported rates of physician utilization of the HPV vaccine among their minority, high risk patient population, 2) To assess physicians' knowledge of, attitudes towards, beliefs regarding, and barriers to recommending the HPV vaccine, 3) To understand physician behaviors that affect the utilization of the HPV vaccine among high risk minority populations and 4) To propose a set of possible strategies to increase rates of HPV vaccination among high risk minority populations. The long term goal of the study is to improve utilization of the HPV vaccine, reducing HPV infection and cervical cancer among high risk, minority populations. A cross-sectional study will be utilized, and will include a random sample of pediatricians, adolescent medicine physicians and family practitioners that serve Brooklyn areas with high rates of cervical cancer. Five constructs will be addressed in a mailed, self administered survey: Knowledge about HPV, HPV vaccine and cervical cancer, Attitudes and beliefs towards the HPV vaccine, Physician barriers toward the HPV vaccine, Perceived patient barriers for the HPV vaccine and Evaluation of the perceived best modalities that could effect change in current HPV vaccine and cervical cancer prevention practices among their high risk patient population.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of those affected by cervical cancer in the United States are from minority populations or foreign-born. Infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. In 2006, a vaccine to protect women against HPV was licensed and recommended for use in women as young as 9 years old. This study seeks to identify the issues that affect providers' utilization of the HPV vaccine with their high risk patients in order to develop strategies to assure that the populations most at risk for cervical cancer are given an opportunity to receive this important vaccine.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-DA-105* Comparing Episodic and Continuous Care for Drug Abuse Treatment. Drug addiction is a chronic illness often characterized by periods of problematic drug use, reductions in use, abstinence, and relapse to problematic drug use. Despite this, substance abuse treatment has traditionally been based on an acute care model-a model that is not sensitive to the long-term nature of the disorder. Aftercare and continuing care models have been developed to extend the benefits of the initial treatment episode, and recovery monitoring has been developed to assess patients' status and return them to treatment as needed. While important advances, limitations of these models include: 1) their narrow focus on treatment completers; 2) their general inability to adjust to changes in patient status; 3) patients tiring of participation and dropping out; and 4) the treatment is of limited duration. Recommendations for improving continuing care interventions include: 1) engaging patients earlier in the treatment process; 2) reducing the burden of treatment for participants; 3) developing algorithms that adjust the treatment to the patient's response; and 4) utilizing active outreach to engage and retain patients. The field needs an addiction management model for drug-dependent patients, which, like disease management for other chronic conditions, provides: 1) initial stabilization; 2) ongoing treatment to maintain clinical gains; 3) monitoring of patient symptoms; and 4) adjustments to the treatment based on the patient's response. The latter component is to help ensure adequate intervention with the minimum burden to the patient. In response to these needs we have developed the Long-Term Recovery Management (LTRM) model. LTRM is predicated on initiating long-term addiction management at the onset of treatment, extending the length of treatment, expediting the transitions between intensive treatment and maintenance of behavioral change, adapting treatment intensity to patient's response to treatment, and actively facilitating the therapeutic alliance. Using techniques from several behavioral therapies (Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), Contingency Management (CM), and Facilitated Therapeutic Alliance (FTA)) with demonstrated efficacy, the LTRM model emphasizes: engagement in continuous care and recovery support, therapeutic alliance, and early re-intervention as the main mechanisms for the maintenance of behavioral change. The purpose of this study is to conduct a fully powered effectiveness trial comparing the recovery trajectories of 200 drug dependent adults who are randomly assigned to Treatment as Usual (TAU) or LTRM. This research will be conducted in an outpatient, community-based treatment program in Columbus, Ohio. Patients will be engaged in LTRM during the first 2 weeks of entry into outpatient treatment and continue for 12 months, with research assessments conducted at 6 and 12 months after baseline. The main outcome variable is weeks of abstinence from primary drug of dependence. Secondary outcomes include drug-free days and reductions in HIV risk behaviors. The Aims and Hypotheses are: Specific Aim 1. To compare the effectiveness of an episodic care model (TAU) and a continuous care model (LTRM) of substance abuse treatment among drug dependent adults. Hypothesis 1: Participants in LTRM will have better abstinence outcomes for their primary drug of dependence, compared to those in TAU. Hypothesis 2: Participants in the Long-Term Recovery Management (LTRM) condition will have a larger number of drug-free days, including alcohol, compared to those in the treatment as usual (TAU) condition. Secondary Aim 1. To compare HIV risk behaviors among participants in LTRM versus TAU. Hypothesis 3. Participants in LTRM will have fewer HIV risk behaviors, compared to participants in TAU. Exploratory Aim 1. To identify key moderating factors, such as primary drug of dependence, gender, ethnicity, and psychiatric comorbidity, that may influence treatment outcome. The proposed study is significant because it will add important perspective to findings from previous randomized trials oriented to chronic disease management that have largely focused on either  recovery monitoring  and re-engagement with stepped-up services when indicated or, clinic- or telephone-based continuing care interventions. In contrast with these important advances, LTRM engages all clients within 2 weeks of outpatient treatment engagement. The study is innovative because the LTRM experimental intervention combines 3 established treatment techniques (CRA, CM, and FTA), each with demonstrated efficacy, into a chronic disease treatment model. In addition, patient cases will be kept open, thereby removing potential obstacles to re-engagement with stepped-up care, when indicated. The proposed study is a clinical effectiveness trial in which 200 drug-dependent, adult outpatients from a community treatment center will be randomly assigned to Treatment as Usual or a newly developed, long-term treatment, referred to as  Long-Term Recovery Management.  The results will benefit public health by adapting treatment and recovery services to the chronic nature of addiction.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05): Comparative Effectiveness Research, and specific Challenge Topic (05-DA-104): Comparing Drug Treatment Effectiveness in Ethnic Minority Populations Background: Although there is relatively little difference in illicit drug use rates between African Americans and Whites, there is are significant differences in terms of the collateral impact of opiate use on these two communities and wide disparities in their access to treatment. Buprenorphine, a partial mu agonist approved for use the US in 2002 outside of strictly regulated opioid treatment programs, has the potential to reduce the disparity between demand for treatment and treatment access. However it appears from early data on the implementation of buprenorphine in the US that the health disparities faced by African Americans are now extending to this treatment. Indeed, according to SAMHSA over 90 percent of the patients receiving buprenorphine in their evaluation of this treatment were White. Many African Americans in urban areas are unable to find or afford the kind of buprenorphine physician office-based treatment that the approval of buprenorphine was intended to make possible. In Maryland and elsewhere, drug treatment agencies are responding to the disparities in access to buprenorphine treatment by offering grants or contracts to drug treatment programs that have traditionally relied exclusively on psychosocial approaches ( drug-free  outpatient programs) to treatment. This arrangement has potential to ameliorate the access problem for African Americans, who in Baltimore make up about 80 percent of the city's heroin-using population. But this arrangement has also uncovered knowledge gaps that must be filled to enable both access and optimal patient centered treatment for this population. One such gap concerns what level of psychosocial treatment is appropriate for this population. Second, we need to understand how attitudes of staff at formerly abstinence-oriented programs affect the use of an opioid agonist in terms of retention in treatment and outcomes. Design: This two-group randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of intensive outpatient (IOP) v. standard outpatient (OP) treatment in 272 heroin-dependent African American adults receiving buprenorphine in 3 formerly  drug-free  programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment intensity conditions at intake and assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-baseline to determine treatment retention, frequency and severity of heroin and cocaine use, self-reported HIV-risk, quality of life, and to determine DSM-IV criteria for Full or Partial Remission of Opioid Dependence. Furthermore, patient factors potentially critical for treatment success (e.g., attitudes towards buprenorphine and average buprenorphine dose while in treatment) will be examined to determine their importance in influencing treatment outcomes. Moreover, both patient and staff attitudes and average buprenorphine dose will be evaluated to determine their respective relationships to treatment experiences and treatment retention. Significance, Innovation and Public Health Impact: This study is significant because it will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention. The use of the DSM-IV criteria for remission as a one of the outcome measures represents an important augmentation of the usual drug abuse research outcome measures, which usually rely primarily upon urine testing results and self-reports of drug use as the primary outcome measure and do not take into account drug- related reductions in clinically significant impairment or distress, despite some continued intermitted drug use. Public Health Statement This study will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment which reduces drug use and HIV-risk. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV infection is associated with increased incidences of multiple tumors, many of which are associated with oncogenic tumor viruses like KSHV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human papillomavirus (HPV). HIV infection is a worldwide health issue affecting both developed and developing nations. Infection with HIV causes a depletion of CD4+ T cells, which leads to immune suppression. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), induced by KSHV, is the most common neoplasm seen among HIV infected individuals. In addition to KS, KSHV is also associated with primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). Currently, there are no therapeutic vaccines that protect against KSHV infection or drugs that can cure infected cells of KSHV. Like all herpesviruses, KSHV establishes life-long latency in the host. Hence, primary infection represents the beginning of KSHV's sojourn in the human host. The goal of this proposal is to use a novel approach to develop a vaccine against KSHV infection. We propose to use rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) as an animal model system for KSHV infection.  RRV was originally isolated from rhesus macaques, is very closely related to KSHV and most of the eighty open reading frames (ORFs) of RRV share high homology with the corresponding ORFs of KSHV. RRV is useful to the study of KSHV pathogenesis because unlike KSHV, RRV has a permissive lytic system and the virus can be grown to high titers. RRV has been shown to induce B cell hyperplasia and lymphoma in the context of SIV co-infection. In addition, the availability of the natural animal host, the rhesus macaque can serve as an invaluable animal model system to determine whether vaccination using a recombinant RRV can protect against challenge with wild-type RRV. The community that will benefit from this research includes all HIV-infected patients at a global level and well as the HIV-negative population. According to the UNAIDS 2008 Report, around 30.8 million adults and 2 million children were living with HIV at the end of 2007. KSHV-associated cancers are much more prevalent in the HIV-infected population and KS is the most frequent cancer seen in this population. Hence, our proposal to develop a KSHV vaccine may have a significant impact. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between Dr. Blossom Damania and Dr. Dirk Dittmer's laboratories in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology and the Lineberger Cancer Center at UNC-Chapel Hill, and Dr. Roland Desrosiers at the New England Primate Research Center at Harvard Medical School.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to Grand Opportunity (GO) RFA-OD-09-004 for Exploratory Research in the Development of Vaccines for AIDS-associated Malignancies. The goal of the application is to develop a novel therapeutic vaccine to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and its associated malignancies. EBV infection is responsible for the majority of AIDS-associated lymphomas. We propose to target the viral-encoded protein, EBNA1, which is the only viral protein consistently expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies. The vaccine will incorporate the fusion of the HSV gD protein to EBNA1 to overcome a negative regulatory arm of the adaptive immune response that has been implicated in tumor-associated immune escape. The vaccine vector will be derived from the E1-deleted adenoviral vectors based on the chimpanzee-serotype 68 (AdC68) to eliminate background immunogenicity to more common human serotypes. The vaccine will be tested in rhesus macaques, using the rhesus lymphocryptovirus (rhLCV) as the most appropriate animal model for EBV lymphomagenesis. To complete these goals, we have assembled a team of investigators with expertise in EBV, rhLCV, cancer-vaccine development and analysis, and immunology of non-human primates. For the studies proposed in this GO application, we will focus on a vaccine to rhEBNA1. Most rhesus macaques are naturally infected with rhLCV, and upon their infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), rhLCV becomes reactivated and can cause lymphomas, suggesting that this virus is an excellent model for proof-of- principle testing of a therapeutic vaccine to EBV. The EBNA1 vaccine will be tested first for the induction of T cell responses in inbred mice, comparing vaccines that express the rhLCV EBNA1 homologue (rhEBNA1) alone or within gD. Once the immunogenicity of the vaccines has been demonstrated in mice, they will be tested in a pilot study in rhesus macaques with pre-existing T cells to EBNA1 due to a natural infection. Immunization success will be measured by the following parameters: a) an increase in cell mediated responses following immunization; b) an increase in antigen specific memory responses to LCV rhEBNA1 in vivo post immunization; c) enhanced quality of the rhEBNA1 directed response based on the frequencies of polyfunctional (multi-cytokine) responses; d) a broader rhEBNA1 T cell repertoire; and e) an increase immune control in virus regression assays and decreased antigen shedding in saliva. These studies will serve as an important proof-of-principle analysis for an EBNA1-specific therapeutic vaccine for treatment of EBV- associated malignancies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects over 95% of the adult population worldwide, and has been estimated to be a contributing agent in ~1% of all human cancer. Its carcinogenic potential is significantly elevated by immunosuppression, as is found in the context of HIV-AIDS and tissue transplantation. Evidence suggests that most EBV-associated malignancies arise through defects in the normal cellular mediated immune response. Methods that enhance the EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell response, like adaptive immunotherapy, can be effective in the treatment of some EBV-associated cancers. Unfortunately, traditional vaccine-strategies have not been successful since these approaches do not overcome the defects in the T-cell response to viral infection. We propose to use a novel strategy to reverse the immunological defect in viral-specific T-cell response using new methods developed in our laboratories. This new vaccine strategy will be tested in mouse and rhesus macaques, which serve as the most relevant immunological models for human infection and viral- carcinogenesis. These pilot studies will provide important information on the mechanism of T-cell response and suppression in EBV-associated cancer, and potentially provide a new vaccine for therapeutic treatment of EBV-associated malignancies in cancer patients.',\n",

This study represents the initial step in evaluating a prophylactic vaccine, which might protect HIV-infected girls and boys from infection with the most common HPV types that cause anogenital dysplasia and external genital lesions.  The long-term goal, following successful completion of this study, is to undertake an efficacy trial in HIV-infected children using QHPV Vaccine, in order to prevent infection and disease caused by the HPV types contained in the vaccine.  It is likely that a follow-up efficacy trial will rely heavily on international sites.This protocol will be undertaken in children 7 to 12 years of age because it is likely that this preventative vaccine will be used before children become sexually active.  It is expected that, in terms of safety, QHPV Vaccine will be generally well-tolerated in HIV-infected children  7 to 12 years of age .  In terms of immunogenicity, administration of a 3-dose regimen of QHPV Vaccine is expected to be immunogenic in at least one immune stratum of HIV-infected children  7 to 12 years of age .HYPOTHESIS QHPV Vaccine will be generally well-tolerated in HIV-infected children 7 to 12 years of age.   Administration of a 3-dose regimen of QHPV Vaccine will be immunogenic in at least one immune stratum of HIV-infected children 7 to 12 years of age.  It is anticipated that the true proportion of HIV-infected subjects who will seroconvert for each vaccine HPV type will be at least 80% in one immune strata.  Seroconversion is defined as the development of antibody levels above the established seropositivity cutoff for each HPV type at Week 4 post-administration of the third dose, in subjects who were na¿¿ve at baseline to the relevant HPV type.  Subjects were considered na¿¿ve if their baseline antibody level was less than the seroconversion cutoff.  Sero-cutoff values will be established for each HPV type based on a qualification plan examining known HPV-negative and low positive sera.  The statistical criterion for success requires that the lower bound of 95% CI for the proportion of subjects who seroconvert be greater than 50%.SPECIFIC AIMS1.\\tTo determine the safety and tolerability of QHPV Vaccine in HIV-infected children ages 7 to 12 years.2.\\tTo determine seroconversion after vaccination with QHPV Vaccine in HIV-infected children ages 7 to 12 years.Secondary1.\\tTo measure the magnitude and persistence of humoral, mucosal and cellular anti-HPV immune responses to a 3-dose immunization schedule with QHPV Vaccine HIV-infected children.2.\\tTo measure the humoral, mucosal and cellular anti-HPV immune responses in subjects who receive a fourth dose of QHPV Vaccine at 96 weeks after the primary vaccine series. 3.\\tTo identify the immunologic and virologic correlates of the anti-HPV antibody responses to QHPV Vaccine.4.\\tTo examine the cross-reactivity of the HPV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses induced by QHPV Vaccine against types not contained in the vaccine.5.\\tTo examine whether safety and/or immunogenicity of QHPV Vaccine varies as a function of the study subjects&#39; immune status at the time of vaccination.6.

In contrast, CMV infection in those without a functional immune system is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.    This includes CMV infections in those co infected with HIV.  Therefore, CMV vaccine strategies developed through these two grants will have direct clinical relevance to protecting those most at risk for CMV disease, including HIV AIDS patients.Since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first recognized as a threat to the developing fetus, there have been repeated calls for a vaccine that could protect from the damaging effects of HCMV infection in those at risk for HCMV disease. The long quest for a HCMV vaccine that could prevent congenital infection and fetal sequelae, as well as end- organ disease in immune compromised individuals, remains unfulfilled. The primary objective measure for evaluating the efficiency of any vaccine is whether protective levels of immunity are generated and sustained in the vaccinees. An important issue for HCMV is the definition of what constitutes protective immunity. Using a stringent threshold, an immune response can be considered protective only if the vaccinees are absolutely protected from infection following repeated exposure to virus. Alternatively, a vaccine could still be considered protective if the course of challenge virus infection was so dramatically altered that the potential for transmission (horizontal and vertical) and pathogenesis of challenge virus was essentially eliminated. The difference between the two involves the level of virus replication at the primary site of challenge and the extent of dissemination beyond. The former definition requires the generation and maintenance of sterilizing immunity with no spread of the virus. The latter does not, but it does require that the immune system maintain a lifelong restriction on replication of a virus with a complex natural history of persistence in immune competent hosts. The hypothesis is presented that immunization against CMV can generate protective immune responses, although the degree of protection (sterilizing versus limited dissemination) will be dependent on both the titer of challenge virus and the frequency of exposure. According to this hypothesis, immunization can protect completely against infrequent exposure to a low titer CMV challenge. Protection will become more variable as the titer and/or the frequency of exposure to challenge virus increases. Vaccination should shift the virus-host balance decidedly in favor of the host such that both reactivation and shedding are significantly diminished. The hypothesis will be tested in the rhesus macaque model of HCMV infection through the following Aims. (I) Genetic immunization of seronegative macaques with plasmid expression vectors for RhCMV gB, pp65, and IE1, followed by immunization with formalin-inactivated virus. (II) Subcutaneous challenge of vaccinees and controls by experimental inoculation with either high or low titers of RhCMV. (III) Immunization of macaques followed by challenge of vaccinees and controls by natural routes with natural titers of RhCMV by co-housing vaccinees with seropositive, virus-excreting macaques. (IV) Alterations of RhCMV gene expression patterns to induce novel protective immune responses. A CMV vaccine can be considered protective if it results in a dead-end infection. This proposal will stringently test whether a combination of genetic immunization and formalin-inactivated virus can effectively eliminate horizontal spread of RhCMV following either experimental or natural infection.',\n",

Our secondary objective is to develop effective and safe vaccine approaches to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children. We propose that basic immune and physiologic mechanisms for respiratory virus pathobiology in the lung can only be elucidated using an in vivo animal model of infection. Although rodent models have been developed for respiratory virus infection, this species does not effectively duplicate the postnatal development of both lung and immune systems in primates. Our goal is to develop an experimental animal model of human respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus infection using the rhesus macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta). Towards this end, the first step is to optimize the susceptibility of rhesus monkeys to human respiratory virus infection. We hypothesize that the development of a respiratory infection model that demonstrates human clinical symptoms will require in vitro passaging of human viral isolates in rhesus cells to obtain robust viral replication in monkey airways.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application entitled  Attenuation of Diverse Cell Death Pathways after Traumatic Brain Injury by Multi- drug Combination Therapy  addresses Broad Challenge Area (15): Translational Science and Specific Challenge Topic: 15-HD-104, Multi-drug Combination Therapy for TBI and Stroke Treatment. The purpose of the proposed studies is to evaluate a novel combination treatment strategy in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). Traditional neuroprotective treatment strategies for TBI aim to prevent delayed (secondary) neuronal cell death, generally by inhibiting one proposed cell death mechanism. Yet considerable research indicates that multiple pathways and mechanisms of cell death contribute to tissue loss. In focal TBI, the central injury site is thought to largely reflect necrotic cell death, which primarily occurs within the first 6-8 hours after trauma and is associated with severe bioenergetic compromise. Our recent work, however, indicates that in several rodent TBI models -mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) or rat lateral fluid percussion (LFP)- cell death in the central core region also includes a substantial component of caspase-independent apoptosis, whereas the better known caspase-dependent cell death is detected in the more peripheral regions where ATP and ADP levels are largely preserved. The caspase-independent programmed cell death (PCD) is due in large part to the activation/translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Such cell death occurs relatively late after injury (24-72h) and can be inhibited by delayed treatment hours after the insult. These data raise serious questions about classical assumptions regarding mechanism of post-traumatic brain injury, suggesting the possibility of newer treatment approaches with extended therapeutic windows and explaining why, if used exclusively, caspase inhibitors may have only a partial protective effect. Ideally, treatment for TBI should attempt to inhibit both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent PCD.   Recent studies in ischemia, as well as unpublished work from our laboratory, suggest two intriguing approaches for limiting the three major pathways of cell death after injury. One approach is to up-regulate heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which binds both Apaf-1 and AIF at distinct sites, thereby neutralizing their pro- apoptotic functions by preventing the formation of the apoptosome (and caspase 3) and attenuating AIF mediated actions. Our preliminary data show that TBI causes up-regulation of HSP70 in many neurons within the injury zone; those neurons expressing HSP 70 show neither caspase-3 activation nor AIF translocation. Up-regulation of HSP70 in cerebral ischemia is strongly protective. The other approach is to inhibit PARP-1. PARP-1, through the release of poly ADP ribose (PAR), is a critical upstream activator AIF release from neuronal mitochondria; it also more recently has been shown to be a critical activator of microglia. Inhibition of PARP-1 after TBI strongly attenuates both caspase dependent and independent forms of PCD, as well as microglial activation, with markedly improved outcome. The advantage of each of these strategies is that their therapeutic window should be very broad, at least 24h. By combining these distinct therapeutic strategies, additive or synergistic protective effects may potentially be achieved. Should our hypotheses be supported, concepts regarding treatment of TBI will be markedly altered and target populations for therapeutic intervention considerably expanded. Combination treatment evaluation is proposed in two pathobiologically different models in different species, with the assumption that potent treatment effects duplicated across models and species makes ultimate clinical translation more likely.   Specific hypotheses include: 1) HSP-70 inducers or PARP-1 inhibitors attenuate caspase-independent and caspase-dependent PCD after TBI, reducing long-term neurological dysfunction; 2) Each treatment approach has a long therapeutic window of at least 24h; 3) combined therapy with HSP-70 inducers and PARP-1 inhibitors demonstrate additive and/or synergistic effects in both mouse CCI and rat LFP models.   We propose the following specific aims: 1) to compare the efficacy, dose response, and therapeutic window of two structurally distinct HSP-70 inducers with regard to attenuation of post-traumatic neuronal cell death and improved functional recovery after moderate CCI injury in mice; 2) to compare the efficacy, dose response and therapeutic window of two structurally distinct PARP-1 inhibitors with regard to attenuation of post-traumatic neuronal cell death and improved functional recovery after moderate CCI injury in mice; 3) to determine whether combined multi-drug therapy with the best HSP-70 inducer and best PARP-1 inhibitor, at optimal doses, has additive or synergistic effects on cell death, microglial activation, and neurodegenerative conditions up to 3 months post-injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines traumatic brain injury (TBI) as craniocerebral trauma associated with a decreased level of consciousness, amnesia, other neurologic or neuropsychological abnormalities, skull fracture, intracranial lesions, or death. It has been reported that the combined incidence of fatal and hospitalized TBI among all age groups has a median annual incidence of 101 per 100,000. Approximately 20% of TBIs cause death either immediately or during acute hospital care, with estimated annual rates of mild TBI treated only in outpatient facilities or hospital emergency departments (EDs) in the United States were 392 and 540 visits per 100,000, respectively. A disability prevalence of 37% has been reported for TBI patients followed more than one year after hospitalization; based on this figure, the CDC has estimated that nearly 2% of the entire US population has TBI-related disabilities. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may occur in as many as 22% of troops deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Recent studies in ischemia, as well as unpublished work from our laboratory, suggest two intriguing approaches for limiting the three major pathways of cell death after injury.

       " 'We reported previously the first randomized study of any kind in patients with    nonmetastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study employed vaccine, the hormone    nilutamide, and the combined therapy (crossover for each arm) with an endpoint of time to    progression. We now report survival analyses at 6.5 years from the initiation of therapy with    a median potential follow-up of 4.4 years. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive    either a poxvirus-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine or nilutamide. Patients in    either arm who developed increasing PSA without radiographic evidence of metastasis could    cross over to receive the combined therapies. Median survival among all patients was 4.4 years    from date of enrollment. Median survival exhibited a trend toward improvement for patients    initially randomized to the vaccine arm (median, 5.1 versus 3.4 years; P = 0.13). Starting    from the on-study date, the retrospectively determined subset of 12 patients who initially    received vaccine and then later received nilutamide suggested improved survival compared with    the 8 patients who began with nilutamide and subsequently were treated with vaccine (median,    6.2 versus 3.7 years; P = 0.045). A subgroup analysis of patients randomized to the vaccine    arm versus the nilutamide arm showed substantial improvements in survival if at baseline    patients had a Gleason score &lt;7 (P = 0.033) and PSA &lt;20 ng/dL (P =    0.013) or who had prior radiation therapy (P = 0.018). These data indicate that patients with    nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (D0.5) who receive vaccine before    second-line hormone therapy may potentially result in improved survival compared with patients    who received hormone therapy and then vaccine. These data also suggest that patients with more    indolent disease may derive greater clinical benefit from vaccine alone or vaccine before    second-line hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy followed by    vaccine. These findings have potential implications for both the design and endpoint analysis    of larger vaccine combination therapy trials. We hypothesized that a metronomic dose of IL-2    as a biological adjuvant would cause less toxicity while maintaining immunologic response.    Eighteen patients with localized prostate cancer were treated in a single arm trial using    previously established doses of vaccine and radiation therapy. The vaccine used was a    recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to encode PSA admixed with a recombinant vaccinia    encoding the costimulatory molecule B7.1, followed by booster vaccinations with a recombinant    fowlpox vector expressing PSA. Patients received a total of eight planned vaccination cycles,    once every 4 weeks, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor given on days 1to 4    and IL-2 at a dose of 0.6MIU/M2 given from days 8 to 21 after each vaccination. Definitive    external beam radiation therapy was initiated after the third vaccination cycle. Patients were    evaluated for safety and immunologic response. Toxicity and immunologic activity were compared    with the previously reported regimen containing a higher dose of IL-2. Seventeen of 18    patients received all eight cycles of vaccine with IL-2. Five of eight HLA-A2+ patients    evaluated had an increase in PSA-specific T cells of &amp;#8805;3-fold. Toxicities    were generally mild, with only seven vaccination cycles of 140 given resulting in grade 3    toxicities possibly attributable to IL-2. Metronomic-dose IL-2 in combination with vaccine and    radiation therapy is safe, can induce prostate-specific immune responses, and has immunologic    activity similar to low-dose IL-2, with markedly reduced toxicities. Dr. Gulley and his    colleagues in the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) and the Medical Oncology    Branch (MOB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), NCI, have ongoing or recently completed in    FY08-09 the following collaborative vaccine clinical trials at the NCI Clinical Center. A    Phase I/II pilot study of sequential vaccinations with rFowlpox-PSA (L155)-TRICOM    (PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM) alone, or in combination with rVaccinia-PSA (L155)-TRICOM    (PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM), and the role of GM-CSF, in patients with prostate cancer, MOB, CCR, NCI.    This is the first trial involving the use of a vaccine for prostate cancer containing    transgenes for three costimulatory molecules. The study showed evidence of significant drops    in serum PSA, objective response, prolonged stable disease and survival in patients with    advanced prostate cancer which correlated with immunologic responses. This trial also provided    evidence for a more appropriate prostate cancer patient population for vaccine therapy trials.    A randomized Phase II trial combining vaccine therapy with PROSTVAC/TRICOM and Flutamide, vs.    Flutamide alone in men with androgen insensitive non metastatic (D0.5) prostate cancer, MOB,    CCR, NCI. This was the first randomized trial to combine a vaccine with this second-line    hormone therapy in D0.5 prostate cancer patients. Phase I Trial of a PSA based vaccine and an    anti-CTLA-4 antibody in patients with Metastatic Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer.

       " 'The HVS in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium, has developed several candidate live attenuated HAV vaccines. One such candidate was modified to become the currently licensed GSK inactivated HAV vaccine. In addition, the HVS has developed a candidate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine that is highly promising and that has recently completed clinical trials. In studies to further characterize this candidate hepatitis E vaccine, we have performed extensive pre-clinical trials to determine the potency of the vaccine, the duration of protection, the optimum regimen for administration, its protective efficacy against homologous versus heterologous virus strains, its ability to prevent infection as well as hepatitis and the minimum antibody titer that was effective in preventing infection and hepatitis, respectively. In the clinical trial, the vaccine was 96% efficacious in preventing hepatitis E following three doses of vaccine and 87% efficacious following two doses.  The vaccine had no detectable side effects.  These results are outstanding for a vaccine.  GSK is currently determining its plans for future manufacture and distribution of the vaccine.  However, in FY 2009, progress in such plans have not been apparent and the NIAID is exploring other options for licensing the intellectual property for a hepatitis E vaccine.  Several Asian pharmaceutical companies have expressed an interest in making a hepatitis E vaccine, perhaps in conjunction with a hepatitis A vaccine.The study of HCV, including vaccine development, is complicated by the genetic heterogeneity of the virus, which has resulted in at least six major genotypes and many subtypes.  Detecting and quantifying the virus requires different sets of primers for PCR amplification.  We have developed real-time PCR assays for the six major genotypes and have compared their specificity and sensitivity with other published assays.  In addition, in FY 2009, we further characterized the six major genotypes of HCV by preparing chimpanzee-derived plasma pools for each and determining the infectivity titer of them by reverse titration in additional chimpanzees.  We will distribute these pools to the scientific community for vaccine studies and anticipate that they will be useful in furthering hepatitis C vaccine development.  As an extension of these studies and as an aid to furthering basic research on HCV, we are preparing infectious cDNA clones of those HCV genotypes for which such clones are not available (genotypes 3, 4, 5 and 6).  These studies are being performed in collaboration with Dr. Jens Bukh and Dr. William Satterfield.Immunity  to HCV is poorly understood and there is controversy over how complete and how long-lasting immunity to prior exposure of the virus is.  This has implications for preventing chronic infections and their sequelae, cirrhosis and liver cancer.  We have demonstrated that immunity to repeated exposure to HCV is genotype-specific, incomplete and relatively short-lived: even reexposure to the homologous virus can result in persistent infection.In other studies, GB virus-B (GBV-B) immunity was further studied. GBV-B is the closest relative to hepatitis C virus, which is very difficult to study because it is  transmissible only to chimpanzees. In contrast, GBV-B is transmissible to tamarins, a species of New World monkey not considered to be endangered. Tamarins that had previously been infected with GBV-B were re-challenged with the same virus and shown to be immune to reinfection; this immunity was long-lived and apparently more complete than immunity to HCV in chimpanzees and humans.  In additional studies to further characterize the similarity between infections by HCV and by GBV-B, in FY 2009, we have examined the mutation rate of acute, self-limiting versus chronic GBV-B infections in tamarins and demonstrated genetic changes similar to those observed in HCV infections.  To date, liver cancer has not been observed in chronic GBV-B infections, perhaps because chronic infections are so uncommon, but we will monitor any additional chronically infected animals for evidence of liver cancer.In 2008, in collaboration with Michael Houghton (formerly of Chiron Corp.), we tested sera from Chirons HCV vaccine trials in chimpanzees,  Specifically, we tested serial sera from chimpanzees that had received Chirons E1-E2 dimer vaccine (derived from the HCV-1 strain) that had been expressed from mammalian cells.  Testing was performed with pseudo-typed retrovirus particles bearing the envelope glycoproteins of each of the major HCV genotypes (HCVpp).  The magnitude of the antibody response against HCVpp bearing the envelope glycoproteins of a heterologous genotype 1a strain  (H77C) paralleled the degree of protection of the chimpanzees: those animals with a high titer of neutralizing antibody against HCVpp were protected, whereas those with a lower titer were not.  In addition, the neutralizing antibody was broadly cross-reactive, also neutralizing principally HCVpp bearing envelope glycoproteins of HCV genotypes 4a, 5a and 6a as well as those bearing the envelope glycoproteins of genoytpe 1a (manuscript in preparation).  We also tested in chimpanzees an HCV vaccine consisting of expressed HCV E1 protein, either with or without expressed HCV NS3 protein.  The vaccine was manufactured by Innogenetics N.V. and was tested under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the company.  In contrast to the experience with the Chiron vaccine, none of the chimpanzees was protected from infection or from persistent infection and none had neutralizing antibody to HCV as measured with the HCVpp test.  The decisive results of this study led to the abandonment of the E1 vaccine by Innogenetics.',\n",
       " 'Our previous results indicate that HBx contains a functional nuclear export signal    motif that utilizes the Ran/Crm1 complex, a component essential in nucleocytoplasmic transport    of many cellular and viral proteins. We demonstrated that HBx not only uses but also disrupts    Ran/Crm1-dependent activities, presumably to prevent a host antiviral response. This finding    implicates the Ran/Crm1 complex in the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus. Recently,    we uncovered a new role of the Ran/Crm1 complex in regulating cellular proteins that control    centrosome duplication and mitotic spindle assembly. We revealed nucleophosmin as a novel    substrate for Ran/Crm1 to negatively regulate unnecessary centrosome duplication. In addition,    we demonstrated a hepatitis B virus / HBx -dependent activation of RanBP1, a Ran-binding    protein that is known to destabilize the Ran/Crm1 complex. Elevated RanBP1 is also observed in    positive liver tissues and in hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased expression of RanBP1 leads    to multipolar spindles and abnormal mitoses. Thus, the combined effects of hepatitis B virus /    HBx contribute to chromosome instability. These findings led us to generate a new hypothesis    in which the Ran/Crm1 complex serves as the centrosome duplication checkpoint by providing a    loading dock mechanism that controls cellular homeostasis, and the disruption of this complex    may result in genomic instability, which may be an early step in viral hepatitis-mediated    hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition to HBx, recently we have completed a pilot study by    determining hepatitis C virus core-related gene expression profiles in B lymphocytes. We found    that hepatitis C virus core may evict immunity by selectively suppressing genes involved in    antigen presentation. These studies are useful in dissecting viral activities that are    essential in hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, we have conducted molecular profiling studies    to compare the gene expression changes in primary human hepatocytes infected with adenoviruses    harboring HBx or hepatitis C virus structural or non-structural genes (p21CORE, NS3 or NS5A).    We also compared these gene expression profiles to those obtained from hepatitis C virus    -infected liver samples from chronic liver disease patients and hepatitis C virus -related    hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that hepatitis C virus -related proteins largely induce    unique genes when compared to HBx. In particular, interferon-inducible gene 27 was highly    expressed in hepatitis C virus or core infected hepatocytes and hepatitis C virus -related    chronic liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, but was less significantly expressed in HBx    infected hepatocytes or hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease or hepatocellular    carcinoma, indicating that interferon-inducible gene 27 may play a role in hepatitis C virus    -mediated hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, our results suggest that hepatitis B virus    and hepatitis C virus promote hepatocellular carcinoma development mainly through different    mechanisms.Our previous results indicate that HBx contains a functional nuclear export signal    motif that utilizes the Ran/Crm1 complex, a component essential in nucleocytoplasmic transport    of many cellular and viral proteins.

       " 'Background: We were encouraged by the results that a short treatment with the CTLA-4    blocking antibody MDX-010 was associated with decreased viral RNA levels in lymph nodes and an    increase in the effector function of both SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, we pursued this    approach and tested the efficacy of protracted CTLA-4 blockade treatment with and without    vaccination or vaccination alone as a control. We found that protracted CTLA-4 blockade    significantly increased T-cell activation and viral replication in primary SIVmac251    infection, particularly at mucosal sites, and increased IDO expression and activity.    Accordingly, protracted treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody of RMs chronically infected with    SIVmac251 decreased responsiveness to antiretroviral therapy and abrogated the ability of    therapeutic T-cell vaccines to decrease viral set point. These data provide the first direct    evidence that immune activation drives viral replication, and suggest caution in the use of    long term therapeutic approaches that increase immune activation in the treatment of HIV    infection.Another study showed that antiretroviral therapy treatment and virus suppression is    sufficient to reduce death ligand but not death receptors in lymphoid tissue of SIV-infected    macaques. We studied mRNA expression of molecules involved in programmed cell death (TRAIL and    FasL) and their receptors (DR5 and Fas) in blood and lymph nodes collected longitudinally from    SIV-infected RMs before and after antiretroviral therapy. TRAIL, FasL, DR5, and Fas expression    were elevated in circulating CD4+ T-cells from SIV-infected RMs and antiretroviral therapy    reduced both TRAIL and DR5 expression in peripheral blood, but only TRAIL and not DR5, in    lymph nodes from the same animals. These findings suggest that antiretroviral therapy is    ineffective in reducing expression of apoptotic death receptors in lymphoid tissue and that    analysis limited to blood leukocytes may not reveal such a defect. Our results highlight the    persistence of an underlying immunologic condition that may prevent therapy-induced    restoration of CD4+ T-cells in lymphoid tissues. Interferon alfa Blockade:The early stages of    infection present formidable obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection.    Understanding and exploiting these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive    infection in an exposed host. The early stages of genital transmission can not be studied in    humans, thus, intra-vaginal SIV infection of RMs represents one of the best animal models in    which to study these events. We will test the contribution of the early innate IFN-I response    at the mucosal portal of entry to the establishment and rate of dissemination of SIV infection    in RMs. We will inhibit the biological activity of IFN&amp;#61537;,    IFN&amp;#61538;, and    IFN&amp;#61559;&amp;#61472;&amp;#61480;IFN&amp;#61472;Type I)    by treating RMs with a blocking antibody, 64G12, that targets the receptor for all these    interferons. Indeed 64G12 inhibits SIV-AT-2 induced IFN&amp;#61537; and    TNF&amp;#61537;&amp;#61472;production in pDCs of RM. Specifically, we wish to    test the effect of 64G12 on: 1) The establishment of intravaginal SIV infection in RMs and the    rate of SIV dissemination to mucosal and peripheral LT, 2) viral and CD4+ T-cell dynamics and    the SIV-specific immune responses, and 3) the levels of mucosal and systemic immune    activation, and disease progression. The early stages of infection present formidable    obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection. Understanding and exploiting    these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive infection in an exposed host. CQ    treatment: Earlier in vitro studies indicated that CQ can block HIV envelope glycosylation and    HIV replication. However, two small clinical trials reported only modest reductions in plasma    virus of 0.4-0.6 log copies/ml.More recently, CQ has been shown to block HIV-induced immune    activation as well as HIV-activated IFN&amp;#61537; production and PDL-1 expression by    plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in normal human PBMCs. It should also be noted that CQ was    recently reported to enhance astrocyte permissiveness to HIV infection, raising the    possibility of complicating and detrimental effects of this drug. We propose to study the in    vivo effects of CQ administration on SIV infection of RMs. Anti PD-1 treatment:We found that    SIV specific T-cells have a proliferative defect that may explain the inability of vaccines to    eliminate infected cells. SIV specific CD8+T-cells express high level of PD-1 and cytokines,    and have impaired proliferative capacity in acute and chronic SIVmac251 infection. Programmed    Death-1 (PD-1) is a critical mediator of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. We examined    the expression of PD-1 on SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells and its possible involvement in the    regulation of cytokine production, proliferation, and survival of these cells. We found that    the majority of SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed a PD-1(high) phenotype, independently of    their differentiation status, in all tissues tested. PD-1 expression gradually declined on    CD8+ T-cells specific for SIV-derived epitopes that had undergone mutational escape,    indicating that antigen-specific TCR stimulation is the primary determinant of PD-1    expression. SIV-specific PD-1(high) CD8+ T-cells produced IFN-&amp;#61543;,    TNF-&amp;#61537;, and IL-2 under cognate peptide stimulation but had a reduced    proliferative capacity when compared to PD-1 (low) SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells. PD-1(high)    SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells were highly susceptible to cell death leading to loss of such cells    after in vitro stimulation. Thus, PD-1 may negatively affect the maintenance of effective CD8+    T-cell responses to HIV/SIV, thus, manipulation of the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands    could result in restoration of the T-cell responses in SIV infection IL-21 treatment: We have    studied in detail the immunological damage induced by SIV infection at mucosal sites of    infected macaques and found that IL-17 producing CD4+T-cells (Th17), a lineage of effector    CD4+ T-helpers recently identified, are infected by SIVmac251 in vitro and in vivo, and their    frequency significantly decreases at mucosal and systemic sites within a few weeks of    infection. In animals that progress to disease, Th1 cells are over-represented compared to    Th17 cells whereas, in SIVmac251-infected elite controller RMs, a normal Th17/Th1 balance is    maintained. Indeed, regression analysis of the frequency of Th17 cells at mucosal sites and    plasma virus level demonstrates a negative correlation, suggesting their importance in HIV/SIV    pathogenesis. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses    to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic enteropathy in HIV infection.    Thus, therapeutic approaches to reconstitute an adequate balance between Th1 and Th17, like    IL-21 treatment, may be considered to ameliorate the clinical course of HIV infection.',\n",
       " 'The filarial parasite, Mansonella perstans (Mp), is endemic in central and West Africa with a geographic distribution that overlaps those of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), Loa loa, and Onchocerca volvulus. The clinical and immunologic contributions of Mp infection are unknown, in part, because of the lack of response of Mp to standard antifilarial therapies.  The recent discovery of bacterial endosymbionts (Wolbachia) in most filarial species, including Mp (Keiser et al. 2008 Mol Biochem Parasitol), provides new therapeutic options for reducing microfilaremia.  In an open label, randomized trial, subjects with Mp microfilaremia with and without concomitant Wb infection were recruited from 4 villages in Mali and received doxycycline (200 mg daily for 6 weeks; n=106) or no treatment (n=110). At 6 months, Wb coinfected subjects were randomized further to receive a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (150 g/kg) or no treatment. Subjects were monitored daily during treatment for adverse events. The effects of drug treatment on Mp and Wb microfilarial levels were assessed at 6, 12 and 36 months following the initiation of doxycycline therapy. Doxycycline was safe and effective at reducing Mp microfilaremia at all time points with complete clearance in 67/69 (97%) doxycycline-treated subjects at 12 months as compared to 10/63 untreated subjects. Clearance persisted in 48/74 (75%) at 36 months consistent with an effect of doxycycline on the adult worms. These results are consistent with previous findings that Mp harbors the intracellular endosymbiont, Wolbachia, and provide the first example of effective therapy for Mp infection (Coulibaly et al 2009 in press). Filariasis and malaria infection are co-endemic in many regions of the world, including subsaharan Africa. We have previously shown that pre-existent filarial infection does not influence susceptibility to malaria infection, but may lower the threshold parasitemia at which clinical symptoms occur. To determine whether the observed decrease in clinical threshold is accompanied by alterations in the cytokine response to acute malaria infection, blood samples were collected from 16 filaria-positive (FP) and 20 filaria-negative (FN) children and young adults (1-20 years of age) who presented with clinical malaria, defined as signs and symptoms consistent with malaria infection in the presence of malaria parasitemia. Plasma levels of IFN-g, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IP-10 and TNF-a were measured by multiplex assay (Luminex). Interestingly, neither the level of malaria parasitemia, nor the presence of fever, was correlated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Plasma levels of IP-10 and IL1Ra, two cytokines that are strongly associated with clinical severity in malaria, were decreased in the FP subjects (GM 2130 and 82 pg/ml, respectively) during acute clinical malaria as compared to the FN subjects (GM 5308 and 489 pg/ml; p = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). All other cytokine levels measured were comparable between the two groups. These findings are consistent with prior findings demonstrating a decrease in the in vitro production of IP-10 by PBMC from FP individuals in response to malaria antigen and provide further in vivo evidence that pre-existent filarial infection can modulate the immune response to incoming malaria parasites. To examine the chronic effects of pre-existent filarial infection on the immune response to malaria, filaria antigen- specific and malaria antigen-specific cytokine responses were examined in 20 FN and 19 FP individuals prior to the malaria transmission season. Of note, the Fil+ group mounted a markedly diminished IL-12p70, IFN-  and IP10  response following MalAg stimulation compared to the Fil- group but a significantly higher IL-10 response. Whereas, anti-TGF- had little effect, anti-IL10 antibodies induced a significant reversal of the MalAg  specific downregulation of IL-12p70, IFN- , and IP10. Taken together these data demonstrate that filarial infections clearly modulate the Pf-specific IL-12p70-IFN- axis known to be pivotal for resistance to malarial parasites and do so in an IL10-dependent manner (Metenou et al 2009 J Immunol).  To determine whether this Pf-specific Type 1 modulation extends to the level of CD4+ T cell frequencies of effector or regulatory cells, the frequencies of cytokine-producing cells were examined in the same population.  Filarial infection was associated with a higher frequency of total CD4+ cells producing IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17 in unstimulated cultures, however, in response to malaria stimulation, Fil+ individuals had lower frequencies of IFN-&#947;-, IL-17- and TNF-&#945;- producing total CD4+ cells, but higher frequencies of IL-10-producing total CD4+. The Fil+ group also had a greater frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+CD4 as well as T cells expressing CTLA-4 and/or IL10 in both unstimulated and MalAg-driven cells compared to the Fil- group.  More interestingly, however, IL-10 was produced primarly by CD4+CD25- T cells and not the Tregs. Together these data demonstrate that filarial infection induces a regulatory environment dominated by CD4+CD25- IL10 producing T cells that modulates the Pf-specific Th1 pathways known to play a key role in resistance to malaria infection. To investigate the relative contribution of nTreg and/or IL-10 (Tr1) to the modulation of malaria-specific cytokine producing T cells, ongoing study is underway to assess the effect of nTreg depletion on the frequency of cytokine producing cells.Albendazole and ivermectin are currently used in combination for annual mass treatment of Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) infection in Africa.  Although the drugs have been donated, the cost of such programs is very high and has proven to be a major impediment to the success of programs in countries with limited financial resources. To determine the effect of increased dose and frequency of albendazole/ivermectin (A/I) treatment on microfilarial clearance, 42 Wb microfilaremic residents of an endemic area in Mali, were randomized to receive standard annual A/I therapy (400 mg/150 mcg/kg; n=22) or biannual increased dose A/I therapy (800 mg/400 mcg/kg; n=20). There was a significant decrease in mf counts both groups with complete clearance of detectable mf at 12 months in all 19 subjects in the biannual group as compared to 10/21 in the annual group (p<0.001, Fishers exact test).  This difference between the two groups was sustained at 18 months with no detectable mf in the subjects receiving biannual treatment as compared to 6/21 in the annual treatment group (p<0.001). There were no significant differences in measures of adult worm burden (circulating antigen levels or worm nests) between the two groups. These findings suggest that increasing the dose and frequency of treatment enhances the efficacy of A/I therapy at suppressing microfilarial levels, although longer therapy may be necessary to demonstrate a significant effect on adult worms.  Analysis of the 24 month data is underway.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and its impact is not yet fully understood. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus in toto. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. With our collaborator, Professor John S. Oxford, post-mortem records of fatal pneumonia cases from 1908-1928 were screened to identify putative influenza cases based on clinical history and post-mortem pathology findings. Promising cases were sectioned for subsequent molecular screening. Sections of post-mortem lung tissues are currently being examined for the presence of influenza A virus RNA fragments by RT-PCR methods previously used to characterize the 1918 pandemic virus from similar samples. 1. Determining the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus: Because the 1918 virus sequence was determined by designing degenerate, overlapping RT-PCR primer sets, the terminal segment sequences, reflecting the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), could not be determined using this method. In experimental pathogenesis experiments rescued influenza viruses containing 1918 gene segments have been chimeras with UTR sequences from the mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 H1N1 virus. It is possible that differences in the native 1918 virus may affect the results of pathogenesis studies. Thus, we have sought to use novel modifications of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methodologies to determine the native 1918 segment UTR sequences from the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 strain. Additionally, 7 of the coding sequences of the 1918 virus were previously determined from this strain, but the full-length HA sequence was only determined from A/South Carolina/1/1918. Thus, we also sought to complete the HA2 domain sequence of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 in addition to the UTRs to give a complete genomic sequence from one pandemic case. The HA2 sequence was completed and found to match the A/South Carolina/1/1918 sequence exactly. Using novel RACE approaches, the complete UTR sequences of the 1918 virus were determined. Several differences between 1918 and WSN33 have been observed in the UTRs of the gene segments. 2. Identification of pre-1918 and post-1918 influenza A virus cDNA-positive human pneumonia autopsy cases: Autopsy case records from the Royal London Hospital from 1907-1935 were screened for possible influenza pneumonia cases in collaboration with John Oxford, and the 20 most promising cases per year were sampled for molecular analysis. Additional 1918 autopsy cases from the AFIP were also screened. These efforts involve archevirologic surveys for pre-1918 human IAV RNA-positive autopsy cases to determine: 1) which subtype(s) of influenza A virus circulated in humans prior to the H1N1 pandemic in 1918; and 2) whether the 1918 pandemic virus retained any gene segment(s) from the previously circulating strain. Examination of post-1918 cases would allow study of the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses in the post-pandemic era before viral isolation in 1933, and allow characterization of virulence factors in the 1918 virus by comparison with less pathogenic but highly related viruses from the mid-1920s.Pre-1918 cases: Several pre-1918 cases were positive in an initial RT-PCR screen for the matrix gene, from 1910-1917, and three 1913 cases were RT-PCR positive after amplification with two degenerate H3 primer sets. Sequence analysis of these small fragments confirmed H3, but intriguingly, had no perfect matches in GenBank. Additional influenza RNA-positive cases from 1915-1917 have also been identified.1918 second wave cases: During an initial screening by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, an additional 26 second wave (fall wave) cases were screened by RT-PCR and 5 new positive cases were identified. Sequence analysis of the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene is being performed on these cases.Post-1918 cases: Several positive cases were identified from 1923, 1926, and 1927. Fragmentary sequence of the HA1 domain of a 1923 case demonstrated several coding differences with the 1918 virus.3. Re-evaluation of the cause of death in 1918 influenza cases: We performed a detailed histopathologic review of available 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic influenza autopsy cases from the archives of the AFIP. The histopathology of fatal influenza virus pneumonias strikingly shows that the spectrum of pathologic changes described in the 1918 influenza pandemic is not significantly different from the histopathology observed in other less lethal pandemics or even in deaths occurring during seasonal influenza outbreaks.We next examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that appeared in the pre-antibiotic era, the 1918 pandemic.  We examined lung tissue sections from 58 autopsies and reviewed pathologic and bacteriologic data from 118 published autopsy series describing in total 8,398 individual autopsy investigations. The 1918 influenza autopsies examined uniformly exhibited severe changes of secondary bacterial pneumonia.  Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series also clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities. Thus, the majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora.  Data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings.  If severe pandemic influenza is largely a problem of viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis, pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., influenza vaccines, antivirals).  Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonias, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high among pandemic planning priorities.',\n",
       " \"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths in the US annually.Role of sialic acid binding specificity of IAV Hemagglutinin (HA) in virulence and pathogenesis: IAV HA is responsible for binding sialic acid containing glycoproteins on cells to initiate infection.  The specificity of HA binding to terminal sialic acid (SA) residues is dependent on the conformation of the bond to the penultimate carbohydrate. In general, avian-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,3 Gal and human-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,6 Gal. To understand how changing HA binding specificity affects IAV virulence in a mouse model, we studied the growth, virulence and pathogenicity of a number of recombinant influenza viruses expressing wild-type and mutant avian and human HA genes created using reverse genetics on the backbone of a contemporary low passage human H1N1 virus. These studies  revealed that the 1918 IAV HA sequence likely contains virulence motifs outside of the receptor binding domain.The role of the ribonucleoprotein complex in host adaptation and pathogenesis of IAV: The proteins that make up the IAV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex - PB2, PB1, PA, and NP  are likely to play a significant role in pathogenesis of IAV infection since a virus that can replicate to a high titer may be more pathogenic, and mutations in these genes are also very likely to be crucial for host switch events in IAV since replication must occur in the context of the host cellular milieu. In order to model RNP activity in different host cell environments, we have a developed a quantitative in vitro reporter assay as a surrogate for viral polymerase function. In this system, the RNP complex from a high path H5N1 virus demonstrated a much higher RNA polymerase activity than either the 1918 or the modern human IAV RNP, while a low path avian RNP complex showed almost no activity in human cells. Interestingly, there are very few coding differences between the RNP complexes of the low path avian virus, the H5N1 virus, and the 1918 virus. A related set of experiments is evaluating the significance of PB1 specifically in viral fitness. Genetic analyses of the previous 3 pandemics of the 20th Century have shown that at a minimum the HA and the PB1 segments have been derived from avian IAV strains. To address this question, we have assayed the function of representative avian, interpandemic, and pandemic PB1s isolated from 1940 to 1968 by using the in vitro reporter assay described above. Indeed, in these assays, the substitution of a pandemic virus-derived PB1 resulted in statistically significant increases in activity of the polymerase complex.The virulence of the 1918 influenza virus is still incompletely understood. While studies described above demonstrate that the 1918 HA encodes virulence determinants in the mouse model, a comparative pathogenicity study was undertaken between the 1918 influenza virus and an early classical swine H1N1 influenza virus, A/swine/Iowa/1931 in mice and ferrets. Interestingly, the swine virus was shown to be equally pathogenic in both mice and ferrets to the 1918 virus, suggesting that virulence determinants in the 1918 virus are preserved in this early classical swine virus. Epidemic or seasonal influenza is also a significant cause of illness and death. The H3N2 influenza viruses circulating in the 2004-2005 season caused more influenza illness and death than in a typical year. We evaluated the dominant strain that emerged in 2004 and were able to show that mutations in the polymerase genes likely contributed to the enhanced pathogenicity of this strain as evaluated in ferrets and in in vitro studies.    Clinical protocol: Influenza in the Immunocompromised Host (#07-I-0229): Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity each year, and past epidemics and pandemics have caused significant mortality.  The impact influenza has or could have on the increasing number of patients who are immunocompromised due to acute and chronic diseases as well as immunosuppressive therapies is largely unknown.  Limited information is available about the innate immune response to influenza and how chronic illness and immunosuppression may affect the immune response to the virus.We have been evaluating patients with influenza by recording their symptoms, collecting their blood and nasal fluid specimens, and isolating their viruses.  We are mapping each patient's infection by performing genomic analysis of the viral isolates collected during the patients' infection (including analysis of sequences known to confer resistance to antiviral medication), measuring cytokine levels in blood and nasal fluid, and measuring influenza-specific antibody responses.  Correlation of these results with clinical symptoms and clinical outcomes is being evaluated.  Elucidation of these responses and the genomic changes the virus may undergo during infection and treatment for influenza in immunocompromised patients may help us to better understand the impact influenza has on the overall health of these patients, as well as what strategies may perform better in protecting or treating these patients during the emergence of a new pandemic. We have identified viral clones in these patient samples with mutations conferring expanded antiviral resistance. Characterization of these viruses in both in vitro and in vivo models is in progress.With the emergence of the new pandemic in 2009, we were able to expand the current protocol to directly recruit immunocompetent patients with influenza into the protocol. We plan to study the natural history of patients with the pandemic in the upcoming influenza season. We developed a rapid and sensitive RT-PCR assay that allows influenza virus samples to be subtyped as 2009 pandemic H1N1 or seasonal H1N1.\",\n",
       " 'This project involves evaluating common human and animal paramyxoviruses as potential human vaccine vectors against highly pathogenic viruses. We previously evaluated human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) as a vector to express the spike glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS). A single dose of the HPIV3-S construct administered by the combined intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) routes was immunogenic and protective against SARS challenge in African green monkeys (AGM). We also previously evaluated HPIV3 as a vector to express the single glycoprotein GP of Ebola virus (EBOV). This construct was highly immunogenic and completely protective in guinea pigs against an adapted strain of EBOV. A single IN/IT inoculation of rhesus monkeys was moderately immunogenic against EBOV and protected 88% of the animals against severe hemorrhagic fever and death caused by EBOV challenge. Two doses were highly immunogenic and all of the animals were free of disease signs and detectable EBOV challenge virus.Since HPIV3 is a common human pathogen and essentially all adults have a history of natural infection with HPIV3, it was important to determine whether previous infection with HPIV3 would restrict the replication and immunogenicity of the HPIV3 vector. In guinea pigs that were infected with HPIV3 and challenged 40 days later with HPIV3/EboGP, replication of the vector could not be detected, indicating a high level of restriction. Surprisingly, however, the immune response to EBOV GP was almost equivalent to that achieved in control animals that had not been previously infected with HPIV3. Next, rhesus monkeys were infected twice with HPIV3 and, 11 months following the second infection, were immunized with two doses of HPIV3/EboGP given 4 weeks apart. ELISA assay of EBOV-specific serum IgG and IgA showed that the level of EBOV-specific serum antibodies following the first dose was reduced 10-15 fold compared to the response in control animals that were HPIV3-nave. However, the serum antibody responses following the second dose were indistinguishable in HPIV3-immune versus HPIV3-naive animals. Thus, an HPIV3-based vector was substantially immunogenic even in the face of strong pre-existing immunity to the vector. Next, we deleted the F and HN genes from HPIV3 and replaced them with EBOV GP to create a virus, HPIV3/delF-HN/EboGP, in which GP would be the sole viral transmembrane surface protein. This virus was attenuated in vitro but eventually reached titers comparable to those of HPIV3. Following IN infection of guinea pigs, this virus was highly attenuated and completely restricted to the respiratory tract but nonetheless was highly immunogenic. A single IN dose provided complete protection of guinea pigs against an otherwise lethal challenge of guinea pig-adapted EBOV. Lacking the HPIV3 neutralization antigens, HPIV3/delF-HN/EboGP was insensitive to neutralization by HPIV3-specific antibodies in vitro. In addition, there was no significant difference in its immunogenicity in guinea pigs that were HPIV3-naive versus HPIV3-immune. Thus, HPIV3/delF-HN/EboGP provides an alternative to HPIV3/EboGP that is very highly attenuated, is insensitive to HPIV3-neutralizing antibodies, and nonetheless is nearly as immunogenic.We also are investigating the use of the avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a human vaccine vector. NDV is antigenically distinct from common human pathogens and thus should not be affected by pre-existing immunity. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence that NDV is highly restricted in humans and does not cause significant disease. We confirmed that NDV is very highly attenuated following IN/IT inoculation of rhesus monkeys and AGM. We found that both low-virulence (lentogenic) and intermediate-virulence (mesogenic) strains replicated to similar low titers in non-human primates, suggesting that either backbone should be suitable for human vaccine purposes. Despite the high level of attenuation, which would be predictive of a high level of vaccine safety, expressed foreign proteins were moderately-to-highly immunogenic. For example, AGM that were immunized IN and IT with two doses of NDV expressing the SARS S protein developed a high titer of SARS-neutralizing serum antibodies and were strongly protected against challenge with a high dose of SARS. Another NDV was engineered to express the hemagglutinin HA glycoprotein of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus (HPAIV) (NDV-HA). The NDV-HA virus was highly attenuated in AGM as well as in eggs and chickens. In AGM, two doses of NDV-HA induced a substantial titer of HPAIV-neutralizing serum antibodies; in addition, a substantial respiratory mucosal IgA response was induced following one and two doses, which would be particularly important in controlling a respiratory pathogen. We established a challenge model using AGM and showed that two doses of NDV-HA conferred essentially complete protection against challenge with a high dose (7.2 log10 PFU) of HPAIV. The high level of restriction of HPAIV challenge virus was established by assay of nasal swabs and tracheal lavages for virus by infectious virus assay and RT-PCR, by direct assay for infectious virus in harvested tissue, by immunohistochemical analysis of harvested tissue, and by profiling challenge-induced pulmonary host gene expression. Replacement of the polybasic cleavage site of the HA insert with the monobasic site from a low pathogenicity strain, an expedient designed to preclude any possibility of introduction of the polybasic site into circulating viruses by genetic exchange, resulted in improved immunogenicity and protective efficacy in this small study. In addition, immunization with NDV expressing the other major HPAIV surface antigen, the neuraminidase (NA) protein, also was highly immunogenic and protective. This was somewhat surprising, since the NA protein had not been considered to be a potent neutralization or protective antigen. These results showed that the modified HA gene and the NA gene are the genes of choice for inclusion in a vectored vaccine for human use. IN administration would be feasible in humans, but IT administration would not. We evaluated IN administration of the NDV construct expressing the SARS S protein and found it was not very immunogenic or protective, presumably because of insufficient vector replication in the nasal passages. Whether or not this will be predictive of replicative capability and immunogenicity in humans is unclear and can only be determined by administration to human volunteers. In the meantime, we explored an additional method of administration, namely by aerosol generated using a nebulizer. This method has been successfully and safely used in large-scale immunization against measles virus. This method of administration proved to be immunogenic and highly protective in AGM, providing a clinically relevant alternative to IN administration. In summary, NDV has considerable potential for further development as a highly attenuated vector for human vaccine use. NDV represents serotype 1 of the avian paramyxoviruses (APMV). There are 8 other serotypes, namely APMV2-9. We have initiated antigenic and sequence analysis of these as a prelude to their evaluation for attenuation and safety in non-human primates as potential vectors. Complete sequences have been determined for representatives of APMV2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. In some cases, complete sequences are available for more than one strain of a serotype, namely APMV2 (2 strains), APMV3 (2 strains), and APMV8 (2 strains). Sequences already were available for two strains of APMV6: we have analyzed 2 more in addition. Also, sequencing of APMV5 is almost complete. The purpose in analyzing multiple strains is to investigate genetic diversity suggested by observed phenotypic and/or genetic diversity',\n",
       " 'Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 170 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), there are 4.1 million persons who are anti-HCV positive, 3.2 million of whom have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2001, chronic liver disease was the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to study. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infections results in sustained eradication of the virus in 54% to 56% of persons. It is evident that a large number of persons do not respond to therapy. The current state of therapy is inadequate, expensive, and cannot be applied to a substantial proportion of affected individuals due to problematic side effects. Therapeutic options for non-responder patients and persons who do not qualify for interferon-based regimens are limited. Thus newer, safer and more effective therapies are urgently needed for chronic HCV infection.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have created a large database of untreated patients with chronic HCV (n700) and have analyzed this database to identify factors that affect the natural history of chronic HCV infection. Using this database, we have already reported on rates of fibrosis progression in untreated patients with chronic HCV infection and that hepatic steatosis does not appear to be a risk factor for progression of fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. More recently, the database was used to search for candidate genes that were associated with fibrosis progression using a genetic haplotype approach. Mx1-CAGT and PKR-TGATT haplotypes were independently associated with less severe hepatic fibrosis (defined as Ishak fibrosis stage &#8804;3).To further define factors associated with fibrosis progression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C, we have analyzed a large, well characterized cohort of over 1000 patients participating in a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of long-term peginterferon versus no therapy for patients with advanced HCV infection (HALT-C-see below). This analysis revealed that higher AST/ALT ratio and total serum bilirubin and lower serum albumin and platelet count were associated with a higher likelihood of developing a clinical outcome in patients with Ishak stage &#8805;3 fibrosis over a period of 3.8 years.Finally, we are validating the usefulness of a new technology, ultrasound elastography (Fibroscan), to non-invasively assess hepatic fibrosis. Results of the Fibroscan will be compared to liver biopsy, MRI elastography and plasma will be stored for future proteomic analysis. Our goal is to develop a series of blood and imaging test that will obviate the need for liver biopsy in most patients with chronic HCV infection.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Though therapy of chronic HCV infection has improved over the last decade, it remains sub-optimal. Close to fifty percent of treated patients fail to achieve sustained clearance of HCV. In the absence of other therapies for non-responders with advanced hepatitis C, one approach to prevent disease progression is to administer a therapy with anti-fibrotic effects over a long-term period. Limited clinical and in vitro data suggest that interferon alfa may slow or arrest progression of injury-related fibrosis, even in non-responders who fail to clear virus. The LDB was one of 10 sites participating in a large NIH sponsored multicenter study, the HALT-C Trial: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term peginterferon alfa-2a for treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients who fail to respond to previous interferon therapy. This study revealed that long-term therapy with low dose peginterferon was ineffective at preventing clinical decompensation and fibrosis progression in patients with CHC with advanced liver fibrosis. Although this was a negative study, the clinical implications are great because maintenance therapy should not be recommended to non-responder patients with chronic HCV infection. Ribavirin, a guanosine nucleoside analogue is critically important for the success of therapy for CHC. Several post-hoc analyses and one pilot study have suggested that higher doses of ribavirin may be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. Accordingly, we have initiated an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose ribavirin in combination with standard dose peginterferon alfa-2a for non-responder and relapser patients with CHC. Viral kinetics in the high dose cohort will be compared to standard dose ribavirin historical controls treated in other LDB protocols. Enrollment is scheduled to begin shortly.3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyThe conduct of clinical trials over the last 30 years has allowed the LDB to acquire invaluable clinical material (patient serum, liver tissue and lymphophocytes) to which state of the art laboratory techniques can be applied to address issues of the pathogenesis of HCV infection and the mechanisms of action of antiviral therapy. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is unknown. Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis due to an increase in the viral mutation rate has been shown to be a possible mechanism of ribavirin in poliovirus, bovine diarrhea virus and GBV-B, viruses very similar to HCV. We have previously shown that ribavirin use is associated with an early, transient increase in the mutation rate of HCV but this effect was not observed at later time points. This suggests that lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action of ribavirin during therapy for chronic HCV infection. Our plan is to extend this investigation, examining the effects of higher doses of ribavirin and the effects of the combination of ribavirin and interferon on viral mutation rate.',\n",
       " 'The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) includes Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Powassan virus and Langat virus (LGTV). The TBFV are listed among the NIAID category B and C lists of priority for research on pathogenesis, to identify novel targets for therapeutic and vaccine development. As their name suggests, these viruses are transmitted by ticks, and following infection of humans, cause encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers resulting in approximately 10,000 to 13,000 hospitalizations annually with mortality rates as high as 40%. The TBFV belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, which comprise some of the most medically significant emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Other members include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Hence, research into the pathogenesis of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of this globally important group of viruses.The research in our laboratory aims to identify and understand interactions between the TBFV and their hosts (both the tick and the mammal) critical to virus replication and pathogenesis. We have been studying LGTV which is a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. This makes LGTV an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. The main studies ongoing in the laboratory are outlined below.1.  Study of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. Ticks represent the natural reservoir of TBFV and therefore are critical for virus persistence in nature and are the major source of infection for humans. We have investigated global transcriptional changes in Ixodes scapularis nymphs infected with LGTV using custom Agilent microarrays. The microarray was based on sequences from an mRNA library derived from salivary glands of Ixodes scapularis ticks. The aim of this work is to identify tick host proteins important for the replication or transmission of TBFV. These proteins can be used for the development of novel anti-tick vaccines that prevent virus transmission to the immunized mammalian host. We first examined transcriptional changes in uninfected ticks during feeding on mice. This revealed clusters of genes that were differentially regulated, particularly on day 0, 1 or 3 post tick attachment. Preliminary results from experiments with LGTV-infected ticks have identified a subset of these genes that are affected by infection. We are currently working to confirm these results and will then determine the immunogenic potential of those gene products.  2. Interactions between TBFV and host innate responses to infection.Following the bite from an infected tick, dendritic cells (DCs) resident in the skin of the mammalian host are among the first cell types infected by TBFV. These cells have important roles in innate immunity through the production of interferon (IFN), cytokines and chemokines, as well as in orchestrating adaptive immunity. Thus, early interactions between these cells and TBFV are likely to have a major influence on the outcome of infection. We have initiated a project in the lab to investigate the effects of TBFV infection on primary DCs and the ability of TBFV to modulate the signal transduction pathways involved in detecting virus infection and producing IFN. Following infection with LGTV, flow cytometry was used to distinguish between infected and uninfected bystander DCs. Maturation profiles revealed that infected DC, but not bystander cells, increased cell surface expression of MHC class II.  However, infected DC did not upregulate CD80 and CD86, costimulatory molecules involved in activating T cell responses. Moreover, infected DC did not respond appropriately to stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or TLR4 ligands. The failure of LGTV-infected DC to express key molecules involved in anti-viral immunity in vivo may contribute to viral evasion of immune responses. Hence, examining these interactions will lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to TBFV pathophysiology.Type I and type II IFNs are crucial elements of the innate immune response to flavivirus infection, restricting virus replication, dissemination and lethality in mouse models. Type I IFN is a potential therapeutic candidate for flavivirus infection. However, such treatment often fails. We have previously shown that LGTV utilizes its nonstructural protein NS5 to interfere with IFN signaling by directly inhibiting Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signal transduction. Over the past year, we have shown that NS5 from other flaviviruses including TBEV also suppress IFN responses. We also found that the virulent New York (NY99) strain of WNV suppressed IFN-dependent JAK-STAT signaling. In contrast, NS5 from Kunjin virus (KUN), a naturally attenuated subtype of WNV, was a poor suppressor of IFN responses. Importantly, mutation of a single residue in KUN NS5 to the analogous residue in WNV-NY99 NS5 (S653F) rendered this protein an efficient inhibitor signaling. Thus, a naturally occurring mutation is associated with reduced ability of NS5 to function as an IFN antagonist and hence may influence virulence of WNV field isolates. This work identifies NS5 as a potential virulence factor of WNV and has implications for live-attenuated vaccine design.',\n",

These consist of a screening protocol and clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines including: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. A brief summary of each study to date follows.The screening protocol, VRC 000 (02-I-0127), facilitates recruitment and screening of healthy, HIV-negative subjects for investigational preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials. Educational materials on vaccines are reviewed with and provided to subjects before enrollment into a study.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5): p. 601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published Vaccine, 2007. 25(20): p. 4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) is a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed.   VRC 009 (05-I-0081) is a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. During FY07 statistical analysis of the study was completed and a manuscript of study results from VRC 009 and 010 combined is under review.VRC 010 (05-I-0140) is a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  During FY07 statistical analysis of the study was completed and a manuscript of study results from VRC 009 and 010 combined is under review.VRC 011 (06-I-0149) is a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed.  The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study are ongoing in FY09.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations are ongoing during FY09.HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase II study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed to begin a new phase of evaluation. It is designed to see whether or not the vaccines have an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who later acquire HIV infection during about 3 years of follow-up.',\n",
       " \"The goal of this contract is to provide support of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) hazard assessment activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents. An overall goal is for the National Toxicology Program's Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) and the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) to assume a greater leadership role in promoting research, development, translation, validation, and regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods. The five-year plan builds on the ICCVAM mission of facilitating the development, validation, and regulatory acceptance of new and revised regulatory test methods that reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in testing while maintaining and promoting scientific quality and the protection of human health, animal health, and the environment. The mission, vision, and strategic priorities will help NICEATM and ICCVAM achieve greater progress and inform the public of their plans and approaches. The plan also builds on the NTP's Roadmap for the 21st Century, which includes the goal of developing, and validating improved testing methods and, where scientifically feasible, to ensure that these methods reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals. The Roadmap also specifies that activities and assays developed under the NTP Roadmap will be conducted in cooperation and consultation with ICCVAM to maximize their value to regulatory agencies.U.S. regulatory agencies are charged with protecting human and animal health and the environment. As part of this mission, agencies need to determine whether adverse effects might result from exposures to substances such as pesticides, consumer products, medicines, medical devices, workplace chemicals, food additives, or to contaminants in air, food, or water. Many of the current test methods for evaluating hazard and risk assessments from exposure to such substances use laboratory animals. Federal agencies require that all test methods should be based on sound science. According to the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, new, revised, and alternative test methods must bedetermined to be valid for their proposed use before agencies can adopt them for regulatory purposes. Validation is required to determine if the use of an alternative test method, compared to current methods or approaches, can provide equal or better protection of human and animal health and the environment.Currently, the four highest priorities are ocular toxicity, dermal toxicity, acute toxicity, and biologics. Other priority areas include immunotoxicity, endocrine disruption, pyrogen testing, reproductive/developmental toxicity, and chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity. These priorities will likely evolve over time in response to new testing needs and advances in science and technology. The inherent complexity of human and animal responses to toxicants means that it is unlikely that any single alternative test method will be able to serve all regulatory needs for a specific testing area. Rather, integrated approaches using batteries of two or more alternative test methods combined with other information about the properties of a test substance will likely be needed to significantly reduce or replace the use of animals for each type of testing. As outlined below, these integrated approaches are being investigated for a number of different toxicity testing areas. Such approaches may be critical to the development of successful hazard assessment methodologies for complex endpoints such as carcinogenicity or reproductive/developmental toxicity, which can result from effects on many different pathways. A priority for each of the areas identified below is the collection and use of available human, animal, and ecological data to assess the performance of existing and new test methods for protecting human and animal health and the environment. Ocular Toxicity TestingThe evaluation of alternative methods for ocular (eye) safety testing is one of ICCVAM's four highest priorities because it is required by multiple agencies as one of the four most commonly required product safety tests and can therefore involve large numbers of animals, and because rabbits used in tests to identify ocular hazards can experience significant pain and distress when eye injuries occur. Regulatory agencies require identification of potential ocular hazards to warn consumers and workers when exposure to a chemical or product may cause blinding or other kinds of eye damage. Prevention of eye injury is of great importance to human health. Two critically important goals are the replacement of the rabbit eye test with one or more alternative assay(s) that can provide equal or greater prediction of these types of hazards, and the implementation of procedures to avoid pain and distress where animals must still be used. NICEATM and ICCVAM recently evaluated and recommended two in vitro test methods that can be used to identify certain types of substances that cause permanent and severe eye damage and that do not use animals. NICEATM and ICCVAM will carry out activities to improve the usefulness and applicability of these test methods. In addition, in collaboration with the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), NICEATM and ICCVAM will evaluate the use of these and other in vitro test methods for accurately identifying substances that cause reversible eye damage or that do not damage the eye. NICEATM and ICCVAM will also evaluate in vitro approaches for determining the ocular irritation potential of antimicrobial cleaning product formulations, and will facilitate the submission of in vivo reference data to be added to a database for use in expanding the development and applicability of new alternative ocular test methods for prevention of eye injury.NICEATM and ICCVAM recently organized scientific symposia on ¿Mechanisms of Chemically-Induced Ocular Injury and Recovery,¿ and ¿Minimizing Pain and Distress in Ocular Toxicity Testing.¿ Symposia recommendations for relevant research, development, and validation studies have been provided to the scientific and regulatory communities for consideration. NICEATM and ICCVAM will encourage stakeholders to carry out the recommended studies, and will evaluate new methods or combinations of in vitro test methods that are developed to reduce or replace animal use for corrosivity and irritation testing. In addition, a comprehensive review of the use of topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics for reducing pain and distress will be conducted to determine their applicability in ocular testing.Biologics TestingBiological products (commonly referred to as biologics) include vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant therapeutic proteins that are used to treat or protect humans or animals. Biologics testing is also one of ICCVAM's four highest priorities because it can require large numbers of animals that may experience significant pain and distress during testing, and it is required by multiple agencies. As such, it is important to identify in vitro alternatives to the current in vivo tests that provide equal or greater protection of human or animal health, and to identify procedures that can be used to reduce or avoid pain and distress where animals must still be used. Alternative test methods are under development that target reduction and replacement of animal testing with in vitro test methods, as well as refinement of animal testing through modifications to the current animal tests. To facilitate the development of these types of alternatives, ICCVAM, NICEATM, and ECVAM recently co-sponsored a workshop that identified activities needed to further reduce, refine, and replace the use of mice for determining the effectiveness of a biologic product. NICEATM and ICCVAM will evaluate alternative test methods and testing strategies for vaccine potency testing and will facilitate the acceptance of adequately validated test methods and humane endpoints found to be sufficiently accurate and reliable. A priority for evaluation will be an in vitro vaccine-related potency test being developed by the USDA to reduce the numbers of animals required to evaluate the potency of a common veterinary bacterial vaccine for Leptospirosis.Dermal Toxicity TestingThe evaluation and development of alternatives for dermal (skin) safety testing is also one of ICCVAM's four highest priorities because it is required by multiple agencies as one of the four most commonly required product safety tests and therefore can involve large numbers of animals, and because rabbits used in tests to identify dermal hazards can experience significant pain and distress. Regulatory agencies require identification of dermal hazards to warn consumers and workers when exposure to a chemical or product may cause skin injury (permanent scarring/burns) or irritation. This information is used to determine appropriate precautions needed to avoid such unintentional injury. Test results are also used to determine appropriate packaging to minimize dangerous spills during transport. ICCVAM's ultimate goal in this area is the replacement of the rabbit skin test for both corrosivity and irritation with alternative methods that meet the requirements of U.S. regulators.In vitro alternatives for dermal corrosivity have been developed, and several of these test methods have been recommended and accepted for regulatory use as screening methods. In appropriate circumstances, substances yielding positive results can be classified and labeled as corrosives without the use of animals. The National Toxicology Program's Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) and ICCVAM will evaluate alternative dermal irritation test methods for their usefulness and limitations in U.S. regulatory testing. This will include an evaluation of the use of a combination of in vitro test methods for both corrosivity and irritation to reduce or replace animals. NICEATM and ICCVAM will also evaluate non-animal methods and approaches for determining the skin irritation potential of antimicrobial cleaning products.\",\n",
       " 'Flaviviruses are a group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a global impact due to their widespread distribution and ability to cause disease in humans and economically important domesticated animals. Several members of this genus, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are considered emerging or re-emerging pathogens because the incidence with which they encounter humans and cause disease is increasing each year at an alarming rate. There are more than 50 million humans infected by flaviviruses each year.WNV is a mosquito-borne member of this genus and is the etiologic agent of West Nile encephalitis. WNV is endemic in parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and has been responsible for periodic outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and horses. The introduction of WNV into North America in 1999 and its rapid spread across the United States into Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean identifies this virus as an emerging pathogen of clinical and economic significance for the Western Hemisphere. While seroprevalence studies indicate that most WNV infections of humans are subclinical, clinically apparent infections range from a febrile illness (West Nile fever) to more severe and potentially fatal neurologic disease. Currently, no WNV vaccine has been approved for use in humans and treatment is supportive.Cryo-electron microscopy studies reveal that the surface of flavivirus virions is covered by a highly ordered icosahedron composed of 180 envelope proteins. The generation of antibodies capable of binding to this array of viral proteins and blocking infection is a critical aspect of the immune response and an important goal of vaccine development. Passive immunization studies and experimental infections of immunodeficient mice demonstrate that antibody plays a significant role in protection from flavivirus infection. The importance of antibodies in vivo reflects an ability to directly neutralize virus infectivity, as well as several distinct effector functions mediated by constant portions of the antibody molecule. The neutralization potential of an antibody is governed by the number of sites on the virion available for binding (determined by epitope accessibility) and the strength of binding (antibody affinity/avidity). Using neutralizing antibodies that bind structurally distinct sites on the WNV or DENV virion, we are investigating the biochemical basis of potency with respect to how antibodies engage virus particles, and in what numbers. Our recent data suggest that neutralization of WNV requires engagement of individual virions with a stoichiometry that exceeds a required threshold. Our estimate for this threshold is roughly 30 antibodies.Due to the quasi-icosahedral symmetry of the mature virion, not all epitopes on the flavivirus are equally accessible for antibody binding. Accessibility modulates antibody potency, as some determinants may not be exposed with a frequency that permits neutralization. Thus, antibodies that recognize such epitopes may neutralize poorly, or not at all, even at concentrations that permit saturation because too few antibodies can simultaneously dock on the virion. Of interest, many antibodies that recognize poorly exposed epitopes on the mature virion still show neutralizing activity in vitro and protect in vivo. How antibodies engage cryptic epitopes on virions with a stoichiometry that permits neutralization is difficult to reconcile using existing static models of virion structure and envelope organization. To investigate mechanisms that govern the potency of antibodies that target cryptic epitopes, we are investigating the dynamics that control epitope accessibility and neutralization potency.Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of DHF cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. At birth, DENV-specific passively acquired antibodies are present at a relatively high concentration and exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro. However, as the child ages, degradation of maternally acquired antibody continues to levels that are no longer protective, do not neutralize virus, and enhance virus infection of Fc-receptor-expressing cells in vitro. The waning antibody titers of infants to levels that support ADE in vitro parallels the risk of DHF following primary DENV infection during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE. To facilitate this goal, our laboratory is investigating the biochemical determinants that comprise the enhancing character of an antibody, and the cell biology that underlies the mechanism of ADE.',\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against pandemic influenza viruses, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. The vaccine was generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the vaccine will be evaluated in animal models. The serum antibody response to one or two doses of vaccine will be evaluated using hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody assays and the efficacy will be evaluated by challenging vaccinated animals with the wild-type H1N1 pandemic influenza virus.',\n",
       " \"Projects started in fiscal year 2009 according to goals (A to D) listed under 'Goals and Objectives': (A1) Development of a hamster model for Ebola virus infection We have established a uniformly lethal model in Syrian golden hamsters using mouse-adapted Ebola virus (EBOV). Hamsters showed severe coagulation abnormalities resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation as seen in patients. Pathological investigation suggested that severe hepatocellular damage and massive cellular depletions in lymphoid organs were the main causes of death. Cytokine gene profiles showed suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression early after infection and massive cytokine up-regulation (cytokine storm) at terminal stages of disease, which both seem to contribute to pathogenesis. (A2) Development of a guinea pig model for Marburg virus infection The Angolan strain of Marburg virus (MARV) is significantly more virulent than other MARV strains. We have established a lethal guinea pig by three sequential passages of the Angola strain in this animal species. The guinea pig-adapted MARV Angola strain is uniformly lethal and causes death within 10 days. Genome sequencing identified a single amino acid change in the matrix protein VP40 as the virulence factor. (A3) Development of a hamster model for New World  hantaviruses.To better understand the pathogenesis of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) we have established a Andes virus animal model in Syrian golden hamster. In order to study the pathogenicity of other HPS causing viruses, we have initiated experiments aimed at adapting Sin Nombre virus to hamsters. The objective of these studies is to perform comparative genetic analysis on the virus during serial passage to identify determinants of virulence acquisition. (A4) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Cynomolgus macaques.Cynomolgus macaques were infected with 3 different SARS-coronavirus mutants. None of the animals showed overt clinical signs but radiological differences were observed between the 3 viruses. Samples were processed for virus titrations, RNA extraction and histology. Plasma samples from each clinical exam were tested for levels of 23 cytokines. Virus titers were determined for all tissues. We are in the progress of titering the organs from this study and awaiting histopathology. (B1) Studying host responses to infection in Syrian golden hamster disease models Syrian golden hamsters have been broadly used in infectious disease research. However, in contrast to mouse and nonhuman primate models appropriate tools to detect host responses are very limited. Therefore, we first developed quantitative real time RT-PCR for monitoring 60 hamster immune response genes. Subsequently, we started a project to sequence the transcriptome of the Syrian golden hamster. All sequence data are back and we are currently in the process of annotation for 35,000 genes. The final goal of this project is the development of an expression microarray chip that can be utilized for pathogenesis and other studies. (B2) Immune responses to hantavirus infectionsIt is thought that the pathogenic potential of hantaviruses correlates with a mal-adaptive immune response to infection. We are interested in the interaction between the virus and the innate and adaptive immune response using both in vitro and in vivo model systems. We have recently discovered that cells defective in type I interferon are able to respond to infection by secreting interferon lambda, a newly recognized cytokine which acts as a link between the innate and adaptive immune response. As of yet, the pattern recognition receptor used by human endothelial cells is undetermined. Currently we are developing assays to introduce short hairpin RNAs and dominant negative constructs into primary human endothelial cells directed towards the PRR pathway to elucidate the mechanisms of innate immune activation.(B3) Antagonism of interferon (IFN) mediated innate immunity by hantaviruses.We hypothesize that hantavirus replication and establishment of persistent infection is mediated in part via evasion of interferon-directed host innate immune responses. Research, to date, has focused on investigating the putative antagonistic function of individual viral proteins.   We could confirm that the glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses appear to be the primary antagonist of RIG-I directed IFN production.  However, in contrast to published literature that implicates the glycoprotein as the main antagonist in innate immunity signaling, our preliminary results suggest that the nucleocapsid protein (NP) serves as the primary antagonist in JAK-STAT signaling.  Furthermore, there may be a difference in the antagonistic effect of the NP based on the pathogenicity of the species from which is it expressed.(B4) Development of a cross-protective Ebola vaccine.  Currently we know five species of EBOV: Zaire, Sudan, Cote dIvoire, Reston and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. VSV vaccine vectors expressing the EBOV-GPs were generated and in vitro characterized. In mice, vaccination with the Sudan, Cote dIvoire and Reston EBOV-GP expressing VSV vectors demonstrated cross-protection against lethal infection. In contrast, guinea pigs could only be protected against lethal infection when vaccinated with a VSV vaccine expressing the homologous, but not a heterologous, EBOV-GP. In additional experiments, guinea pigs infected with wildtype EBOV species were fully protected against lethal disease independent on the source of the initial infection. The data suggest that cross-protection against multiple EBOV species is possible; however the EBOV-GP alone does not seem to be sufficient in inducing protective immunity. (C1) Rodent-borne pathogen surveillance in MaliRecently a fatal case of Lassa fever was documented in a young man who worked in Southern Mali, marking the first time this disease had been documented in that country. Lassa fever is caused by Lassa virus, a rodent borne pathogen belonging to the Arenaviridae. In collaboration with Dr. Schwans group, we went to Mali to assist in his field work, and to collect samples from the captured rodents to assess the prevalence of Lassa, and other rodent-borne pathogens in Mali. In total we collected 412 samples from 103 rodents and testing will begin within the next month.    (D1) Development of Henipavirus expression plasmids and VSV pseudotype viruses. We are in the progress of cloning the Nipah and Hendravirus glycoproteins (G) and fusion (F) proteins into an expression plasmids (pCAGGS) for the production of recombinant G and F protein as well as into a VSV&#8710;G plasmid with the goal to generate a recombinant VSV expressing the G and F proteins of Nipah or Hendraviruses.(D2) The importance of cathepsin cleavage for filovirus replication.Cellular cystein proteases cathepsin B & L have been shown to play an important role in Ebola virus. The goal is to analyze cathepsin B & L cleavage for all filovirus glycoproteins (GP) as well as chimeric proteins, containing parts of Ebola virus GP, using a Vesicular-Stomatitis-Virus based pseudoparticle system and reverse genetics to generate recombinant viruses. Eventually cathepsin dependent Ebola replication will be tested in vivo using cathepsin B & L ko mice. Preliminary datas suggest that Ebola virus replication is cathepsin B but not cathepsin L dependent. Current work is focused on confirming these findings.(E) Not strated yet.\",\n",
       " 'EVPS is focused on the development and characterization of authentic animal models of disease for orthopoxviruses and hemorrhagic fever viruses and the identification of countermeasures against disease caused by these infections.   Findings from FY09 are summarized below.1.  Viral pathogenesis of orthopoxviruses and development of countermeasures against infection.  Identification of an animal model that most closely resembles natural smallpox transmission and infection is critically important for testing of countermeasures because efficacy studies in humans are obviously not possible.  We have investigated both monkeypox virus (MPXV) and cowpox virus (CPXV) infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs).  Comparison of the intravenous (i.v.) and intrabronchial (i.b.) route of MPXV infection was studied to determine if i.b. inoculation would result in disease that more closely resembles the course of naturally acquired orthopoxvirus infection via the aerosol route.  Uniform lethal disease was observed with an i.v. challenge dose of 5x10e7 PFU in cynomolgus macaques, while a ten-fold reduced challenge resulted in 33% moribundity.  Clinical signs consisted of extensive lesion development, fever, and anorexia.  A pro-inflammatory cytokine response was observed in NHPs as demonstrated by increase levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1.  In contrast, i.b. infection only resulted in 33% moribundity at the highest dose tested although lesional disease and fever were observed.  Viral load was similar between the i.v. and i.b. groups.  Although disease was observed, we found significant consolidation of the lung and severe broncho-pneumonia at the site of inoculation which may limit the usefulness of this model.  We have also employed CT and PET/CT imaging to monitor progression of disease after i.b. inoculation and observed lymph node inflammation and consolidation and inflammation of the lung.  We are currently planning to use the i.v. route for study of countermeasures and considering further routes of inoculation including aerosol.  We have further pursued CPXV infection as a BSL-2 model of orthopoxvirus infection and a surrogate model of variola virus infection and demonstrated that i.b. infection with CPXV Brighton strain replicates to high levels in NHPs resulting in lethal disease.  A new CPXV strain derived from a lethal outbreak in a German primate center in 2002 was also evaluated in NHPs because it was suspected to be highly virulent.  Surprisingly, only mild disease with low fever and no moribundity was observed.  Nevertheless, CPXV Brighton infection of NHPs has been established as a potential model of orthopoxvirus infection.  Our initial investigation of antipoxviral drugs has focused on Mitoxantrone which is an approved chemotherapy drug that was demonstrated to have in vitro antiviral activity against vaccinia virus.  We found that Mitoxantrone had an EC50 of 0.03 uM against CPXV and 0.4 uM against MPXV which were comparable to the results observed previously with vaccinia virus.  In a virus yield assay using the CPXV Brighton strain, the presence of mitoxantrone was able to block virus replication as determined by plaque assay of tissue culture supernatants.  In contrast, MPXV was only marginally inhibited by mitoxantrone in a virus yield assay.  We found that treatment of CPXV-infected mice with 0.5 mg/kg mitoxantrone resulted in 25% protection from moribundity and an extension of 3.5 days in mean time of death of nonsurvivors compared to untreated controls.  We have demonstrated limited efficacy of mitoxantrone in vivo against CPXV indicating that this drug might be pursued further alone or in combination with other poxviral treatments. 2.  Establishment of simian hemorrhagic fever virus as a BSL-2 model of viral hemorrhagic fever.  Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), a member of the arterivirus family, is classified as a BSL-2 agent as it is not infectious to humans and can therefore be used to study the pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic fevers in a NHP model without BSL-4 containment.  The virus was shown to be responsible for explosive outbreaks of disease in NHP facilities in the 1960s to 1980s before it was determined that epizootics could be blocked by preventative measures including improved aseptic technique and sequestration of species.  We inoculated groups of three rhesus macaques with serial ten-fold dilutions of SHFV from 5x10e4 PFU to 5x10e1 PFU and observed that severity of disease was not dose-dependent.  NHPs exhibited clinical signs similar to previous reports of SHFV infection including fever, anorexia, increased clotting time, mild facial edema, mild petechial rash, and increased ALP, AST, and ALT values.  Approximately 66% of NHPs across the dosage groups succumbed to infection with average time to moribundity of 10 to 16 days.  Coagulation defects were detected including increased APTT clotting times.  Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected after infection including interferon gamma, IL-8 and IL-12.  Unexpectedly, nearly 50% of SHFV-infected NHPs had evidence of sepsis and secondary bacterial infection which is not typically associated with viral hemorrhagic fevers although it has been reported.  We are currently testing whether a higher dose will result in more consistent disease and the reproducibility of the finding of sepsis.3.  Countermeasures against viral hemorrhagic fevers.  A safe and effective vaccine against Zaire ebola virus (ZEBOV) would potentially be used by multiple groups including healthcare providers, laboratory researchers, and military personnel.  A vaccine could also be used to mitigate outbreaks in Africa and possibly be used to protect endemic nonhuman primate populations that have been affected by ZEBOV.  While multiple strategies for ZEBOV vaccine development have been pursued, no current vaccine is close to being licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.  Unresolved issues with current vaccine candidates include safety concerns, pre-existing immunity to vectored vaccines, and manufacturing and dosage obstacles.  We are developing an alternative vaccine approach in collaboration with Dr. Matthias Schnell using attenuated rabies virus vaccine based vectors that express the major protective antigen of ZEBOV, the virion surface glycoprotein (GP). Rabies virus based vectors have previously been generated that express protective antigens from human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and anthrax protective antigen and found to be safe, attenuated, and efficacious in mice and/or nonhuman primates.  The main objective of the present study is to determine the level of immunogenicity of rabies virus vaccine-based vectors expressing ZEBOV GP as either live or killed vaccines and determine their efficacy in animal models of ZEBOV infection.  Currently, we have generated an infectious cDNA clone of rabies vaccine virus expressing ZEBOV GP and recovered it in tissue culture.  We will next expand the virus, characterize it in vitro, and investigate immunogenicity and efficacy in mice.',\n",
       " 'La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, is a mosquito-borne virus recognized as a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America with 70-130 symptomatic cases each year. The virus was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl who suffered encephalitis and died in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The majority of LACV infections are mild and never reported, however, serologic studies estimate infection rates of 10-30/100,000 in endemic areas.  LAC encephalitis has become the most commonly reported pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the US with 70-130 symptomatic cases a year with severe sequelae. For these reasons we are interested in developing a vaccine to prevent this CNS disease.  Sequence analysis: Sequence analysis of the complete LACV genomes of low-passage LACVhuman1960, LACVmosquito1978, and LACVhuman1978 strains and of biologically cloned derivatives of each strain, indicates that circulating LACVs are genetically stable over time and geographic distance with 99.6-100%, 98.9-100%, 97.8-99.6%, and 99.2-99.7% amino acid identity for N, NSs, M polyprotein, and L proteins respectively. We also identified allelic difference in the L, M, and S segments of LACV viruses. Two major alleles (Group 1 and Group 2) were identified with co-segregation of alleles in L, M, and S segments for all but one isolate that was a reassortant virus.  This indicated that reassortants occur in nature but they are unusual. Nucleotide sequence analysis of additional human and mosquito isolates revealed that LACV isolated from humans are predominantly from allelic Group 1 that differs from the predominant allele prevalent in mosquitoes, Group 2.  Allelic Group 1 viruses are significantly overrepresented in humans (80% of isolates form humans versus only 10% in mosquitoes), and therefore they might be the more virulent of the two groups.  An allelic group 1 virus (over-represented in human CNS isolates) was more virulent in the CNS of mice and monkeys than an allelic Group 2 virus. This indicates one of the reasons for the low severe disease to infection ratio for this virus is due to the under-representation of the more virulent virus in nature.  Parenthetically, the rhesus monkey model of CNS disease following intracerebral inoculation of LACV can be used to study both the level of attenuation of live attenuated virus vaccine candidates in the CNS and of the efficacy of immunization with such a candidate in a challenge study.  A detailed study of the neuropathogenesis of LACV for the CNS of non-human primates is being determined.To identify a nucleotide sequence of LACV associated with the wild type phenotype, i.e. replication competent in insect and mammalian cells and able to cause encephalitic disease in suckling and weanling mice by peripheral and intracranial routes of inoculation, we sequenced the complete genomes of three low-passage LACV isolates, namely, LACV/human/1960, LACV/human/1978, LACV/mosquito/1978, isolated over a 18 year period of time.  Biologically cloned derivatives of each virus were also sequenced. The level of neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness for each of the three virus isolates and their cloned derivatives was determined in mice by assessing clinical disease following intracerebral or intraperitoneal administration of virus.  LACV strains appear highly genetically stable in nature, grow to high titers in monkey and mosquito cell cultures, and are highly neurovirulent and neruoinvasive for mice even at low dosage.  Since one of the long-term goals of this project is to develop a live attenuated virus vaccine for LACV, the identification of a nucleotide sequence of LACV that specifies a wild type phenotype was seen as an essential first step in this process.  A single amino acid substitution was identified in GN  (a threonine to alanine substitution at position 148 in the GN) in one of the cloned LACV strains, a strain that exhibited greatly decreased neuroinvasiveness. In addition, a second mutation, a E577G substitution in GC, that attenuates the neuroinvasiveness of LACV for mice has been identified.  Such mutations may be useful in developing live-attenuated virus vaccine candidates.  These mutations were selected for incorporation into LACV derived using reverse genetics.Reverse genetics:  A reverse genetics system for LACV has previously been reported that was used to generate a virus lacking NSs.  We have reproduced this system and have generated a set of rLACV viruses with NSs KO, E577G mutation in GC, or T148A mutation in GN either as a single mutation or in various combinations. The rLACV mutants will be evaluated for LD50 and for level of replication in the CNS of mice.  Their level of infectivity and immunogenicity will be evaluated in non-human primates to determine if they are infectious, attenuated, and immunogenic for non-human primates.  \\tWe anticipate that we will be able to attenuate LACV.  Given our experience with antigenic chimeric viruses of the various flaviviruses, we sought to explore the possibility that we could use an attenuated LACV as a backbone to create antigenic chimeric viruses in which the coding region of the M segment of LACV is replaced with that of a second bunyavirus.  We initiated this study with a bunyavirus from the same California Encephalitis Virus serogroup, but that was serologically sufficiently distant in neutralization assays.  The virus selected was Jamestown Canyon Virus (JVC) since it was a BSL2 virus that also can caused disease in humans. JCV is a mosquito-borne virus that has a wide geographic distribution in temperate North America.  It causes disease in adult humans ranging from mild febrile disease to severe encephalitis.  Its principal host is the white tailed deer and is primarily vectored by Aedes and Ochlerotatus mosquito species. Its seroprevalence is about 4% indicating that infection with this virus is not rare.  We have isolated an antigenic chimeric virus and have initiated studies to characterize its properties, comparing its replication in vitro and in vivo with those of its LACV and JCV parents.  Preliminary finding indicate that the chimeric virus is attenuated for the CNS of mice.',\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype, including H5N1 viruses that have caused human infections since 2003. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, clinical lots of vaccines were generated and Phase I clinical trials of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccines for healthy adults were undertaken under an IND. Several factors contribute to the possibility of a H2 influenza pandemic. First, H2 viruses have proven capable of causing disease in humans. Of the sixteen HA and nine NA subtypes, only H1, H2 and H3 viruses have been known to lead to human influenza pandemics since influenza viruses were first isolated in 1933. While H1N1 and H3N2 viruses have been co-circulating for the past 30 years, H2N2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968. Thus, there is declining pre-existing immunity to H2 influenza viruses in the population today. Although H2 influenza has not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. The cold adapted (ca) influenza A/AA/6/60 (AA) (H2N2) virus is the backbone for the live attenuated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine licensed in the United States. However, only a small number of pre-clinical and clinical trials have been conducted evaluating the AA ca (H2N2) virus as a vaccine. We therefore evaluated the attenuation, immunogenicity and efficacy of the AA ca (H2N2) virus in mice and ferrets in order to determine the suitability of developing this virus as a vaccine candidate for use in the event of an H2 pandemic.The AA ca virus was restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets. In mice, 2 doses of the AA ca vaccine elicited a greater than four-fold rise in hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titer and conferred complete protection against homologous wild type virus challenge. In ferrets, a single dose of the AA ca vaccine elicited a greater than four-fold rise in HAI titer and conferred complete protection against homologous wild type virus challenge in the upper respiratory tract. In both mice and ferrets, the AA ca virus provided significant protection from replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of heterologous H2 viruses A/Mallard/NY/ 6750/78 (H2N2), A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2) and A/Swine/MO/4296424/2006 (H2N3). The AA ca vaccine is safe, immunogenic and efficacious against homologous and heterologous challenge in mice and ferrets, supporting the evaluation of this vaccine in clinical trials.LID and MedImmune scientists evaluated the immune responses to ca vaccine viruses generated under this program in animal models. Primary and recall B cell responses to live attenuated H5N1 vaccine viruses were examined using a sensitive antigen-specific B cell ELISpot assay to investigate the effect of preexisting heterosubtypic influenza immunity on the development of H5N1-specific B cell immune responses in ferrets.  Live attenuated H5N1 A/Hong Kong/213/03 and A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine viruses induced measurable H5-specific IgM and IgG secreting B cells after intranasal vaccination.  However, H5-specific IgG secreting cells were detected significantly earlier and at a greater frequency after H5N1 inoculation in ferrets previously primed with trivalent live attenuated influenza (H1N1, H3N2 and B) vaccine.  Priming studies further revealed that the more rapid B cell responses to H5 resulted from cross-reactive B cell immunity to the hemagglutinin H1 protein.  Moreover, vaccination with the H1N1 vaccine virus was able to induce protective responses capable of limiting replication of the H5N1 vaccine virus to a level comparable with prior vaccination with the H5N1 vaccine virus without affecting H5N1 vaccine virus induced antibody response.  Our data indicated that previous vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine may accelerate onset of immunity by an H5N1 ca vaccine which may be of value for pandemic preparedness.Transmission of H5N1 influenza viruses from birds to humans poses a significant public health threat and LID scientists collaborated with scientists at the University of Washington to study the host response of mice to H5N1 viruses.  A substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 627 of the PB2 protein of H5N1 viruses has been identified as a virulence determinant.  We utilized the BALB/c mouse model of H5N1 infection to examine how this substitution affected virus-host interactions and led to systemic infection.  Mice infected with H5N1 viruses containing lysine at amino acid (aa) 627 in the PB2 protein exhibited increased severity of lesions in the lung parenchyma and the spleen, increased apoptosis in the lungs, and a decrease in oxygen saturation.  Gene expression profiling revealed that T cell receptor activation was impaired at 2 days post-infection (dpi) in the lungs of mice infected with these viruses.   The inflammatory response was highly activated in the lungs of mice infected with these viruses and was sustained at 4 dpi.  In the spleen, immune-related processes including NK cell cytotoxicity and antigen presentation were highly activated by 2 dpi.  These differences were not solely attributable to differences in viral replication in the lungs, but also to inefficient viral clearance early in infection.  The timing and magnitude of the immune response to highly pathogenic influenza viruses was critical in determining the outcome of infection.  Disruption of these factors by a single aa substitution in a polymerase protein of an influenza virus was associated with severe disease and allowed the virus to spread to extrapulmonary sites.',\n",
       " 'An experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease is critical for the study of human AIDS. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. The purpose of this project is to investigate host and viral factors involved in variable disease progression in SIV-infected macaques and the lack of disease in African primates infected with their own strains of SIV.PATHOGENESIS OF SIVsm-INFECTION OF MACAQUES:To investigate the role of host factors in SIV-infection of macaques, we used a well-defined molecularly cloned virus (SIVsmE543-3). Our initial studies focused on defining the immune and viral factors involved in rapid disease progression. This small subset of SIV-infected macaques fails to maintain SIV-specific immune responses and progress to AIDS in less than six months from the time of inoculation. RP macaques showed profound and irreversible depletion of memory CD4+ T cells that likely explain the immune deficits in these animals. Molecular studies of virus in tissues and plasma of rapid progressor macaques exhibited common substitutions in the env gene. These substitutions were unusual in that they involved residues that were generally conserved and that were known to affect binding of env to CD4 or coreceptor. Virus from RP macaques was molecularly and biologically characterized and full length infectious molecular clones of various RP viruses were derived from plasma of a RP macaque, H635. The H635 viruses replicated less efficiently in primary macaque PBMC and macrophages than the parental SIVsmE543-3 strain and were much more senstitive to neutralizing antibody. Macaques inoculated with one of these viruses, H635-FC developed moderate to high primary and setpoint viremia, and progressive CD4+ T cell depletion but did not develop rapid disease. Sequence analysis of plasma virus in these animals demonstrated rapid loss of RP-specific env mutations concurrent with the development of neutralizing antibody response. These studies suggested that rapid progressor mutations are the consequence, not the cause of rapid disease progression.ROLE OF AUTOANTIBODIES IN AIDS PATHOGENESIS.  The progressive decline of CD4+ T cells is a hallmark of disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infection. Whereas the acute phase of the infection is dominated by virus-mediated depletion of memory CD4+ T cells, chronic infection is often associated with a progressive decline of total CD4+ T cells, including the nave subset. The mechanism of this second phase of CD4+ T cell loss is unclear and may include immune activation induced cell death, immune-mediated destruction and regenerative or homeostatic failure. We studied patterns of CD4+ T cell subset depletion in blood and tissues in a group of 20 rhesus macaques inoculated with derivatives of the pathogenic SIVsmE543-3 or SIVmac239. Phenotypic analysis of CD4+ T cells demonstrated two patterns of CD4+ T cell depletion, primarily affecting either nave or memory CD4+ T cells. Progressive decline of total CD4+ T cells was observed only in macaques with nave CD4+ T cell depletion (ND), though the depletion of memory CD4+ T cells was profound in macaques with memory CD4+ T cell depletion (MD). ND macaques exhibited lower viral load and higher SIV-specific antibody responses and greater B cell activation than MD macaques. Depletion of nave CD4+ T cells was associated with plasma antibodies autoreactive with CD4+ T cells, increasing numbers of IgG-coated CD4+ T cells and increased incidence of autoreactive antibodies to platelets (GPIIIa), dsDNA and phospholipid (aPL). Consistent with a biological role of these antibodies, these latter antibodies were accompanied by clinical features associated with autoimmune disorders, thrombocytopenia, and catastrophic thrombotic events. More importantly for AIDS pathogenesis, the level of autoreactive antibodies significantly correlated with the extent of nave CD4+ T cell depletion. These results suggest an important role of autoreactive antibodies in the CD4+ T cell decline observed during progression to AIDS.SIV NEUROPATHOGENSISSIV and HIV are both associated with the development of encephalitis.  For HIV, the onset of AIDS dementia is generally a late stage finding.  In contrast, most models of SIV encephalitis (SIVE) use animals that progress rapidly to disease.  We observed a small number of conventional progressors that developed SIVE.  The evolution of SIV in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was compared with the virus that evolved in the plasma of two rhesus macaques that developed SIV encephalitis. While the virus in the CSF and plasma were similar during primary infection, distinct substitutions were observed sequentially in the two compartments. These findings are consistent with compartmentalization between the brain and blood during development of neuro-AIDS and the evolution of viruses with distinct genotypes and potentially distinct biological phenotypes in the brain. We are currently studying the pathogenesis of these CSF and brain isolates in a cohort of nave macaques and currently are observing development of SIV encephalitis in a subset of animals, as evaluated by increasing levels of SIV RNA in CSF samples. Evolution of virus in the brain, CSF, blood and lymphoid tissues will be evaluated.ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION OF NATURAL HOST SPECIESA second goal of this project is to study the mechanisms underlying the lack of pathogenicity of SIV for their natural host species, with emphasis on SIVagm from vervet monkeys. SIVagm is capable of inducing AIDS in PT macaques but African green monkeys (AGM) do not develop overt signs of disease following infection. We evaluated the viral kinetics of a natural SIVagm isolate in two species of AGM, vervet monkeys (the species of origin of SIVagm90) and sabaeus monkeys from the Barbados. The virologic outcome in sabaeus and vervet AGM was surprisingly divergent. Inoculation of sabaeus AGM with SIVagm90 resulted in low and variable levels of primary viremia and low setpoints (< 100 to 10,000 copies/ml). In contrast, inoculation of vervet AGM resulted in high primary viremia and establishment of moderate plateau levels (10,000 to 100,000). Regardless of the extent of viremia, CD4+ T lymphocytes remained stable throughout infection of AGM with no significant relationship between viral load and CD4+ T cell loss. A large number of investigations have shown that CD8+ T cell responses are critical for the containment of AIDS viruses in humans and Asian nonhuman primates. We compared the phenotype of T cell subsets and magnitude of SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in chronically SIVagm-infected vervet AGM and SIVmac-infected rhesus monkeys (RM). In comparison to RM, vervet AGM exhibited lower signs of immune activation and associated proliferation of CD8+ T cells as detected by granzyme B, Ki-67, and PD-1 staining. SIV Gag and Env-specific immune responses were detectable at variable but slightly lower levels in vervet AGM by IFN-g ELISPOT assay and intracellular cytokine staining than observed in RM. These observations demonstrate that natural hosts like SIV-infected vervet AGM develop SIV-specific T cell responses, but the disease-free course of infection does not appear to depend on the generation of robust CD8+ T cell responses.',\n",
       " 'Vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis viruses.Tick-borne encephalitis viruses are important neurotropic human pathogens, causing a devastating and often fatal neuroinfection. A live attenuated TBEV vaccine is expected to induce a more durable protective immunity than that induced by the inactivated TBEV vaccine that is not licensed in the USA. The live attenuated TBEV vaccine candidates are being developed in the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV with a non-neuroinvasive, mosquito-borne dengue-4 virus (DEN4d30) that contains an attenuating mutation, a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3non-coding region. In FY 2009, we have focused on the identification of a chimeric TBEV/DEN4 vaccine candidate that is suitable for evaluation in humans and that exhibits the following important properties: (1) reduced neurovirulence and restricted replication in the brains of mice; (2) restricted or ablated neuroinvasiveness in immunodeficient mice; (3) decreased replication in rhesus monkeys; (4) ability to induce a protective TBEV-specific immune response in monkeys; and (5) a low level of neurovirulence in the CNS of non-human primates. The results of histopathological analysis of the CNS together with clinical observations and data on chimeric TBEV/DEN4d30 virus replication in the brain and spinal cord of monkeys indicated that chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV strain with non-neuroinvasive DEN4d30 had an attenuating effect on the neurovirulence of TBEV in monkeys. However, this effect was insufficient to justify bringing this vaccine candidate to trials in humans. Further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4d30 neurovirulence was undertaken by introducing amino acid substitutions that had previously been shown to reduce replication of tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) or DEN4 in suckling mouse brain. When two amino acid substitutions (Lys315 > Glu in the structural envelop E protein and Asp654Arg655 > AlaAla in the non-structural NS5 protein) were introduced into TBEV/DEN4d30 genome, the resulting virus (TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655) demonstrated the desired properties of an acceptable live attenuated vaccine candidate as it displayed (1) a 490-fold decrease in neurovirulence in suckling mice, (2) more than 10,000-fold restriction of replication in the brain of suckling mice, (3) a non-neuroinvasive phenotype in immunodeficient mice, (4) was still safe and immunogenic in monkeys, and (5) failed to infect and replicate in mosquitoes and ticks. A seed TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655 virus was recently generated, and its neurovirulence and protective efficacy in non-human primates should be evaluated before clinical trials can be initiated.Since TBEV/DEN4d30 evoked a strong cellular inflammatory response in the CNS of monkeys, we have developed a new computerized method for quantitative evaluation of the CNS infiltration with peripheral immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD20 lymphocytes) and the response of CNS resident cells (microglial activation and neuronal degeneration). We found that immunoreactivity for CD3 T cells and CD20 B cells correlated remarkably well with semi-quantitative histopathological scores for cellular inflammatory infiltration in the CNS of monkeys inoculated with either yellow fever (YF) 17D, LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 attenuated viruses. Our data indicate that a high CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in the CNS inflammatory infiltrates induced in response to YF 17D infection is a major factor that differentiates this successful vaccine from a more neurovirulent LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 virus. It is likely that the balanced response of T and B cells within the CNS of monkeys induced with YF 17D vaccine virus plays an important role in the recovery from CNS infection and might serve as a reference to evaluate the safety of new live flavivirus vaccine candidates. Vaccines against West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus.A live attenuated WN/DEN4d30 virus vaccine is being developed in the LID to protect humans against WN disease. In FY 2009, in a clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers, the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine was well tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response after two doses (100,000 PFU) of immunizations. Further studies of neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis in monkeys are necessary to evaluate the safety of this vaccine for the CNS of non-human primates prior to its use in the risk group of volunteers >50 years of age. Chimerization of SLE with DEN4 resulted in only moderate restriction in replication in rhesus monkeys, whereas the presence of the d30 mutation led to over-attenuation.  Both chimeras (SLE/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4d30) retained high neurovirulence in suckling mice. In an effort to identify a SLE/DEN4 virus that will exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity in mice and monkeys, we generated a set of SLE/DEN4 mutants by introducing the attenuating mutations such as the paired charge-to-alanine mutations in the NS5 protein and a Phe156> Ser mutation in E. Pre-clinical testing of these mutants for neurovirulence in mice and immunogenicity in monkeys will be initiated.',\n",
       " 'An appropriate vaccine is essential for a global pandemic preparedness and response. Hemagglutination inhibition assays reveal that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses are antigenically homogeneous and distinct from currently circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses. Based on antigenic and genetic analysis and epidemiologic information, the WHO selected the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus as the reference virus for vaccine development. We will evaluate the immunogenicity and infectivity of the live attenuated reassortant H1N1 virus containing the surface glycoproteins from the California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus and internal protein genes from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold-adapted (ca) virus in clinical trials.',\n",
       " \"Summary:The major impact of diarrheal diseases occurs in children under 5 years of age who suffer approximately 18% (about 2 million) of over 10 million deaths in this age group annually, with the greatest toll in the developing countries. Rotaviruses (RVs) have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries accounting for approximately 500,000 deaths in the under 5 year age group, mostly in developing countries. RVs are uniquely egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions. We developed an oral, live, attenuated RV vaccine in a quadrivalent formulation to protect against the four epidemiologically important serotypes (G1-4).The vaccine was comprised of representatives of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus rotavirus (RRV), a G3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and three human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing ten RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype G1, G2, or G4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the candidate vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease, the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Subsequently,in August, 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV) to Wyeth Laboratories. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception. Following additional CDC investigations, in October 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported the vaccine's link with intussusception. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Laboratories withdrew the vaccine from the market. Later data demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor in the link with intussusception. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to intussusception (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately. In addition, there are questions regarding the vaccine's actual attributable risk of intussusception, a risk estimate that has ranged widely. Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 epidemiologically-important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-Univ.of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study in Finland, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule, the BRV-TV and RRV-TV induced a high level of protection against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH collaborative study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in three different schedules, showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition, the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at two months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company (which has now been transferred to the non-profit International Medica Foundation IMF) for the NIH-developed technology for RotaShield. This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially but was revived when funding became available from the IMF. Thus, quadrivalent RRV-TV vaccine was produced as a clinical product by The IDT Biologika GmbH in Germany, and became available in 2009 for clinical trial. Initial steps were taken to carry out a clinical trial in Malawi in 2009 but it was cancelled because of a mismatch of the circulating serotypes with those in the vaccine. Other sites were evaluated under the auspices of the IMF by Kendle International and a site in Ghana was selected for the clinical trial. A placebo-controlled phase II safety and efficacy trial began with RotaShield in Ghana in August 2009 and will include approximately 1000 neonates. The vaccine is given in two doses, one at 0-4 weeks of age and a second at 4-8 weeks of age with a minimum interval of three weeks between doses and no catch-up vacation beyond 8 weeks of age. This schedule will take advantage of the observation that there is a relatively refractory period for developing intussusception during the first two months of life. The first dose of vaccine or placebo was given to 9 neonates on August 28, 2009. In addition,efforts to implement our second generation vaccine, the human RV-bovine RV reassortant vaccine for the developing countries have advanced. The NIH OTT has granted licenses to develop and commercialize the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions, one in the U.S. and seven in developing countries (Brazil, China and India). As of 2009, there is encouraging progress as vaccine production has reached the point that one company in Brazil has initiated phase I studies in adults. Two companies in India are engaged in vaccine development and are planning phase I studies for the end of this year or early next year. One company in China is now producing the reagents such as master virus seeds etc and is anticipated to begin phase I studies late next year. Our laboratory continues to serve as the unofficial reference laboratory. We are proposing that (i) the second generation RV vaccine be comprised of 6 serotypes (G1-4, 8 and 9) as a universal vaccine or as a specifically designed vaccine for different areas of the world, (ii) that it should be given in a two-dose schedule at 0-4 and 4-8 weeks of age, which is a relatively refractory period for intussusception under natural conditions. The proposed manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its availability at a low cost, which would facilitate its implementation in these developing areas of the world. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world was given an unsolicited boost, when we were notified in October 2006 by PATH that the Gates Foundation had approved their application with funding  ... to support the process and clinical development of the NIH bovine rotavirus vaccine through Phase 2 at two selected manufacturers; and address product development challenges relevant to all emerging manufacturers of this vaccine.  In certain countries, an alternative schedule may be adopted which takes advantage of the experience gained from observations described above  and from Rotateq and Rotarix, two recently licensed RV vaccines, with regard to the first dose: administer the first dose at 6-12 weeks with no catch-up vaccination and administer the second and third doses at 3-4 week intervals.\",\n",
       " 'Wild mouse species and the various inbred laboratory mouse strains differ from one another in their susceptibility to the mouse gammaretroviruses and retrovirus-induced cancers. These differences are due to variations in specific host genes, and we have been engaged in an ongoing effort to identify and characterize several mouse genes involved in virus resistance.  Our major interest has been on factors that interfere directly with virus infection and replication, and we focus our efforts on those factors that inhibit virus entry and the early post-entry stages of the virus replicative cycle.  At the level of entry, there are two types of resistance genes that target the receptor-virus interaction.  Receptors can be blocked by virus envelope glycoprotein produced by endogenous retroviruses, or resistance can be cause by polymorphisms in the cell surface receptor.  After the gammaretrovirus enters the receptive cell, reverse transcription and translocation to the nucleus can be inhibited or altered by virus resistance factors Fv1, mApobec/Rfv3, and TRIM5alpha.Our current aim is to characterize these resistance factors and the viruses they target, define the origin and extent of antiviral activity in Mus evolution, and elucidate the responsible mechanisms.  This work relies heavily on wild mice because laboratory strains provide only a limited sampling of the genetic diversity in Mus.  Also, wild mouse species allow us to examine survival strategies in natural populations that harbor virus and to follow the evolution of the resistance genes.  These mice additionally provide a source of novel resistance genes and virus variants.  One set of projects is concerned with cell surface virus receptors and these studies focus on identifying viral and cell receptor determinants responsible for virus binding, entry, and receptor mediated cytopathicity.  One series of experiments focuses on two unusual variants of the ecotropic gammaretroviruses that are cytopathic in M. dunni cells and also have altered host range.  These phenotypes are due to different amino acid substitutions at the same site in viral envelope gene of the two viruses. This substitution alters one of the 3 amino acids that form the cell surface receptor binding site.  The fact that these 2 viruses cause cytopathic effects in a cell line with a variant receptor gene suggests that the virus-receptor interaction mediates cytopathicity. This conclusion was confirmed by the observation that cytopathicity due to virus infection is seen in stable transfectants expressing this variant receptor but not in transfectants expressing the prototypical receptor.  We have now inoculated mice with this cytopathic virus to determine if the lymphoma-type cancer induced by the progenitor virus is altered by the mutations that cause cytopathic cell fusion.  Because evidence also suggests that cytopathicity is affected by inhibitors of glycosylation, we are currently evaluating the role of glycosylation in virus infectivity and cytopathicity.  We have now demonstrated that receptor glycosylation modulates virus entry through both naturally occuring variants of the ecotropic receptor.  We are currently looking at the effect of virus envelope glycosylation on the efficiency of virus entry.     In another series of experiments, we have been characterizing virus susceptibility differences identified in a panel of cells derived from evolutionarily divergent wild mouse species.  These cells show novel patterns of resistance not found among laboratory strains.  One of these resistance phenotypes was identified in the African pygmy mouse, Mus minutoides which is completely resistant to the ecotropic gammaretrovirus found in common inbred strains, although it is susceptible to laboratory virus strains such as Moloney leukemia virus.  We have shown that the block to virus replication is post entry and targets the viral capsid.  We have now identified the responsible gene as Fv1, and we expanded this analysis to examine other wild mice for Fv1 variants.  This phylogenetic analysis led us to identify 6 amino acid residues in Fv1 as being under positive evolutionary selection.  3 of these residues are known to be responsible for resistance in laboratory mice suggesting that this resistance has been important throughout mouse evolution.  3 additional selected residues are in the region of Fv1 related to the virus capsid, suggesting that Fv1 interferes with the structural integrity of infecting virions.     Among the mouse genes responsible for resistance to mouse leukemia viruses is Rfv3 (recovery from Friend virus).  This gene was recently shown to be encoded by the mouse APOBEC (mA3) gene, a cytidine deaminase gene known to restrict other retroviruses in mice and in humans.  We sequenced mA3 from multiple laboratory and wild mice to examine its evolution.  We discovered that the mA3 allele in virus resistant mice is disrupted by insertion of the regulatory signals of a mouse leukmia virus that may be responsible for enhanced mA3 expression and altered splicing.  We also subjected the mA3 protein coding sequences to phylogenetic analysis.  We identified 6 sites under positive selection, 6 of which are in two clusters that distinguish the virus restrictive and nonrestrictive mouse variants, and that are known to be important for human APOBEC3G function.  We also showed that these two clusters are positioned opposite each other along the groove that forms the mA3 active site.  We thus show that mA3 has had an antiviral role throughout mouse evolution, and we identify an inserted regulatory sequence and two clusters in the protein coding sequence that may contribute to this antiviral function.     We are also interested in determining the extent to which virus resistance is mediated by polymorphisms of the cell surface receptor.  We seek to analyze the XPR1 receptor for the xenotropic/polytropic gammaretroviruses.  This family of viruses is widespread in mice, and related viruses have now been found in koalas, gibbon apes, and human cancer patients. We identified a fourth XPR1 susceptibility variant in the Asian mouse species, Mus pahari.  These mice are resistant to the polytropic gammaretroviruses and susceptible to the xenotropic viruses, a pattern that is the opposite of that found in laboratory mice.  We have now cloned and characterized the pahari cellular receptor that mediates entry of both xenotropic and polytropic viruses.  We analyzed chimeras and mutants of the different receptors to show that 2 of the 4 extracellular loops of this membrane protein contain the determinants for virus entry.  We identified two critical amino acids, one in each loop, that independently mediate entry of xenotropic viruses.  We also identified 3 amino acids responsible for entry of the polytropic subgroup of viruses.  Using cells expressing the 4 different XPR1 receptors and the 2 additional variants found in hamster and rat cells, we showed that there are in fact 6 host range subtypes of viruses that rely on this receptor for entry, and one of these variants is defined by the gammaretrovirus-like XMRV virus isolated from human prostate cancer patients.  We are now characterizing this receptor in primates and in human cancer patients.  The extent of this polymorphism in XPR1 and in the envelope genes should help us understand the entry process and may help account for the incidence of interspecies transmissions of these viruses in rodent and non-rodent species.',\n",
       " \"Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man, where they generally    induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association    between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain human papillomavirus (HPV)    types, most frequently HPV 16. Our research is primarily concerned with development of    vaccines and other infection inhibition strategies against HPV and the elucidation of the PV    life cycle. We have developed a simple and efficient strategy for generating high titers of    infectious papillomavirus particles that transduce encapsidated marker plasmids, referred to    hereafter as pseudovirions. This methodology represents a technical breakthrough in    papillomavirus research. We have exploited this technology in our basic virologic and    translational research efforts. We have used our pseudovirus technology to develop the first    cervicovaginal challenge model for HPVs. We have found that the infection of the female mouse    genital tract, even of monolayer endocervical cells, requires exposure the basement membrane    to the virus. The capsids bind avidly to the basement membrane but not to the apical surfaces    of intact columnar or stratified squamous epithelia. Using a quantitative assay based on whole    tissue fluorecence imaging after infection with red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing    pseudovirions, we have further determined that nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and Conceptrol, an over the    counter spermacide that containing N-9, dramatically potentiate in vivo papillomavirus    infection, presumably due to it's ability to permeablize the epithelial layers and thereby    expose the basement membrane to the virus. Interesting, no infection was detected if    nonoxynol-9 was formulated in carrageenan rather than its normal gelling agent. Carrageenan is    an algal polysaccharide widely used in processed food and cosmetics and is the main gelling    agent in some over-the-counter lubricants. The results suggest that women using N-9    spermacides may be at increased risk of acquiring genital HPV infection and that this risk    might be eliminated by reformulation of N-9 in a carrageenan based gel. We are currently    working with the NCI extramural division DCP to initial clinical trial of carrageenan as a    microbicide to prevent genital HPV infection in young women. Our studies in the mouse    cervicovaginal challenge model suggested that other interventions that compromise the    integrity of the genital epithelium might potentiate HPV infection. Acquisition of ecto- and    endocervical cells for cytology (Pap) screening disrupts the epithelium by design. Therefore    we sought to determine whether the cytology specimen (Pap smear) collection procedure renders    the cervix more susceptible to HPV infection in a rhesus macaque model. In unpublished    studies, we found that the Pap smear collection procedure greatly potentiated infection by RFP    expressing HPV16 pseudovirus. However, use of a carrageenan gel rather than Surgilube as the    lubricant used for the internal digital exam after specimen collection largely abrogated the    infection enhancing effect. These findings suggest that cytology screening in women might lead    to a transient enhancement of susceptibility to HPV infection and that use of a    carrageenan-based gel during the examine might mitigate this enhancement. The    pseudovirus-based mouse cerviovaginal challenge model is also being used to explore the basic    features of papillomavirus infection and the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of    the virus in the female reproductive tract. We have discovered that, in a process unique to    papillomaviruses, the initial steps in infection occur after initial binding to heperan    sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the basement membrane, prior cell surface binding.    Specifically the virions undergo a conformational change that exposes the N-terminus of the L2    minor capsid protein to cleavage by furin, a cellular protease that we detect in abundance at    the sites of infection in vivo. This cleavage in turns leads to exposure of highly conserved    L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes that are immediately downstream of the cleavage site. Blocking    HSPG interactions or furin cleavage prevented cerviovaginal infection. In a process that takes    several hours, the virions transfer from the basement membrane to the surface of keratinocytes    invading the site of trauma, and the virions are then internalized. Interestingly, antibodies    induced by L1 VLP vaccines (of type that are how commercially available) and L2 vaccines    (which we developing as a more broadly cross type-neutralizing alternative) block in vivo    infection by distinct mechanisms. L1 VLP antibodies block binding to the basement membrane,    but allow binding to the keratinocytes. However, the L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes are not    exposed and the virions are not internalized. L2 antibodies that broadly cross-neutralize HPV    types permit the initial virion binding to the basement membrane HSPG. However, the virions    are not detected in the tissue at later time points, suggesting that the L2 antibodies prevent    stable transfer to the keratinocytes. These studies may well provide the most detailed    mechanistic understanding of how a virus, in a living mammalian host, infects its relevant    tissue and how vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in vivo. Our    development of a method to induce efficient HPV pseudovirus infection of the female genital    tract after transient disruption with N-9 has proven to be the key to our recent development    of an effective intravaginal vaccination strategy. In patent pending studies, we have found    that intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination of N-9 treated mice induces strong systemic and    mucosal T and B cell responses to target antigens transduced by the pseudovirions. Systemic    responses rival those induced by previously optimized Ad5 vectors. Intravaginal responses are    remarkably strong, with up to 80% of all intravaginal CD8 T cells staining tetramer positive    for the targeted antigen. Most of the induced T appear to be intraepithelial and high level of    effector memory CD8 T cells are maintained in the vaginal tract 100 days after vaccination.    Upper respiratory tract delivery of the HPV pseudovirus induced a detectable T cell response    in the female genital tract, but it was much weaker than the response after intravaginal    vaccination. Intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination is a promising approach for focusing immune    responses to the female genital tract and so might increase the effectiveness of vaccines    directed against HSV and HIV infections and against HPV induced neoplasia. To more generally    evaluate the potential of HPV pseudoviruses as gene transfer vehicles, we have conducted a    broad infection tropism survey. In patent pending studies, we demonstrated that intact murine    epithelium at all sites, whether simple, columnar, or squamous, was highly resistant to both    virion binding and infection, whereas disrupted epithelium was susceptible. In contrast,    virtually all human-derived epithelial cell lines in the NC1-60 panel were highly susceptible    to infection in vitro. The remarkable specificity of HPV pseudovirus binding and infection    suggests that they may be useful in tumor diagnostic or cytotoxic gene therapy applications.    In proof of concept studies, we documented highly specific binding and infection, and dramatic    imaging, of human ovarian tumor nodules implanted in nude mouse peritoneum after    intraperitoneal injection of RFP-expressing pseudovirus.

       " 'Human parainfluenza viruses are significant causes of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. HPIV1 is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the subfamily Paramyxovirinae within the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes the HPIV2 and HPIV3 serotypes. These serotypes can be further classified as belonging to either the Respirovirus (HPIV1 and HPIV3) or Rubulavirus (HPIV2) genus and are immunologically distinct in that primary infection does not result in cross-neutralization or cross-protection. The HPIV1 genome encodes three nucleocapsid-associated proteins including the nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (P) and the large polymerase (L) and three envelope-associated proteins including the internal matrix protein (M) and the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the two viral neutralization antigens and are the major viral protective antigens. The HPIVs cause respiratory tract disease ranging from mild illness, including rhinitis, pharyngitis, and otitis media, to severe disease, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. HPIV1, HPIV2 and HPIV3 have been identified as the etiologic agents responsible for 6.0%, 3.3% and 11.5%, respectively, of hospitalizations of infants and young children for respiratory tract disease. Together these viruses account for approximately 18% of all pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory disease. A licensed vaccine is currently not available for any of the HPIVs.  The major goals of this project are to develop live attenuated virus vaccines that are effective in infants and children against HPIV1, HPIV2, and HPIV3. Pre-clinical research is currently not being conducted with HPIV3 in LID since we have multiple HPIV3 vaccines in clinical trials and three additional HPIV3 vaccine candidates are being prepared for manufacture.  Thus, this report focuses on HPIV1 and HPIV2.  HPIV1 vaccine development:  A novel recombinant human parainfluenza virus type 1 (rHPIV1), rHPIV1-C+P, was generated in which the overlapping open reading frames of the C and P genes were separated in order to introduce mutations into the C gene without affecting P.  Infectious rHPIV1-C+P was readily recovered and replicated as efficiently as HPIV1 wild-type (wt) in vitro and in African green monkeys (AGMs).  rHPIV1-C+P expressed increased levels of C protein and, surprisingly, activated the type I IFN and apoptosis responses more strongly than HPIV1 wt.  rHPIV1-C+P provided a useful backbone for recovering an attenuated P/C gene deletion mutation, (del84-85), which was previously unrecoverable, likely due to detrimental effects of the deletion on the function of the P protein.  rHPIV1-C(del84-85)+P and an additional mutant, rHPIV1-C(del169-170) +P, were found to replicate to similar titers in vitro and to activate the type I IFN and apoptosis responses to a similar degree as rHPIV1-C+P.  rHPIV1-C(del84-85)+P was highly attenuated in AGMs, and all of the viruses were immunogenic and effective in protecting AGMs against challenge with HPIV1 wt.  rHPIV1-C(del84-85)+P will be investigated as a potential live-attenuated vaccine candidate for HPIV1.We further sought to understand the role of the C proteins in apoptosis.  Recombinant HPIV1 (rHPIV1) was modified to create rHPIV1-P(C-), a virus in which expression of the C proteins (C, C, Y1 and Y2) was silenced without affecting the amino acid sequence of the P protein.  Infectious rHPIV1-P(C-) was readily recovered from cDNA, indicating that the four C proteins were not essential for virus replication.  rHPIV1-P(C-) replicated in vitro as efficiently as HPIV1 wt early during infection, but its titer subsequently decreased coincident with the onset of an extensive cytopathic effect (cpe) not observed with rHPIV1 wt which was the result of the activation of apoptosis in rHPIV1-P(C-) infected cells.  The apoptosis was initiated by activation of both the intrinsic (caspase 9) and extrinsic (caspase 8) pathways, but was found not to be the cause of the reduction in viral replication.  HPIV2 vaccine development: In wild-type human parainfluenza virus type 2 (wt HPIV2), one gene (the P/V gene) encodes both the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P) and the accessory cysteine-rich V protein.  The P and V proteins share the same N-terminal sequence but have different C-terminal domains due to RNA editing. V is an accessory protein that, in model paramyxoviruses, inhibits the cellular interferon (IFN) response and regulates viral RNA synthesis, in addition to performing other functions that remain less well defined.  We generated an HPIV2 virus (rHPIV2-Vko) in which the P/V gene encodes only the P protein to examine the role of V in replication in vivo and for use as a potential live attenuated virus vaccine.  Preventing expression of the V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells.  The rHPIV2-Vko virus, unlike wt HPIV2, strongly induced type I IFN and permitted signaling through the IFN receptor, leading to establishment of a robust antiviral state.  rHPIV2-Vko infection induced extensive syncytia and caused dramatic cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis.  Replication of rHPIV2-Vko was highly restricted in the upper and lower respiratory tract of African green monkeys and was not detected in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that the V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in vivo and in HAE cultures in vitro.  The high degree of restriction of rHPIV2-Vko in non-human primates and in primary HAE cultures suggests that this mutant is over-attenuated and would not be suitable as a live attenuated virus vaccine, but it will be useful to study the function of V during HPIV2 infection. We next characterized wild-type HPIV2 (rHPIV2-WT) infection in a well-established in vitro model of human airway epithelium (HAE) and revealed that the virus replicates to high titer, is shed only apically, targets ciliated cells, and induces minimal cytopathology.  Since HPIV2 mutants are currently being developed as live attenuated vaccine candidates, we next sought to determine if infection of HAE with the HPIV2 vaccine candidate, which was described in last years annual report and which is currently in clinical trials, reflects replication in non-human primates.  An experimental HPIV2 vaccine strain, rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/del1724, that contains both temperature sensitive (ts) and non-ts attenuating mutations, was previously found to be restricted in replication in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of African green monkeys (AGMS) and to be protective against wild-type HPIV2 challenge. rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/del1724 was reduced in replication by more than 30-fold compared to rHPIV2-WT in HAE cultures at 32C and exhibited little productive replication in cultures at 37C, reflecting a similar restriction of replication in the cooler URT and warmer LRT of AGMs .  These data indicate that the HAE model provides a convenient experimental system for examining the cell tropism, cytotoxicity, and attenuation phenotypes of HPIV2 vaccine candidates as well as for characterizing the innate host responses of human airway epithelial tissues to infection.  Since clinical trials are the only true tests of vaccine safety and efficacy, the results from this study encourage continued evaluation of rHPIV2-VAC in clinical trials.',\n",
       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flavivirus genus that has a global impact on public heath due to its widespread distribution and the ability to cause severe disease in humans. Each year, 50-100 million individuals are infected by DENV, with clinical manifestations ranging from a self-limiting acute febrile illness (dengue fever) to a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF). Four related serotypes of DENV circulate in nature, each capable of causing the full spectrum of DENV-related disease.  Prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrate that sequential infection with two DENV serotypes is associated with a more severe disease course.  The number of DHF cases reported has increased dramatically during the past twenty years, and now exceeds 250,000 cases annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV.Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in protection against flavivirus infection. Antibodies have been mapped to all three structural domains of the E protein (DI-DIII) that exhibit varying degrees of neutralization potency and confer protection by multiple effector mechanisms. Eliciting neutralizing antibody is a major goal of vaccine development. Complicating these efforts is a requirement for vaccines to simultaneously elicit protection against four different viruses that while antigenically related, share only some of the antibody-binding determinants thought to contribute to virus neutralization. Thus, antibodies raised against one serotype of DENV may react with virions of another serotype, but often with reduced affinity and functional potency.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of DHF cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. At birth, DENV-specific passively acquired antibodies are present at a relatively high concentration and exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro. However, as the child ages, degradation of maternally acquired antibody continues to levels that are no longer protective, do not neutralize virus, and enhance virus infection in vitro. The waning antibody titers of infants to levels that support ADE in vitro parallels the risk of DHF following primary DENV infection during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE.The development of a protective tetravalent response is complicated by the possibility that not all four components of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may be equally immunogenic in the vaccinee. Interference and uneven levels of infectivity among DENV strains in this context has been reported. Understanding the immunogenicity of each component of a tetravalent vaccine is an important aspect of vaccine development and identifying appropriate correlates of protection, particularly because it is presently unclear how many serotype-specific responses will be required for protection from all four serotypes of DENV. However, dissecting the specific contribution of each element of a tetravalent vaccine is technically challenging due to the presence of antibodies that bind cross-reactive determinants shared by different components of the vaccine. A detailed map of the functionally important type-specific and group-reactive epitopes on the E protein is not presently available. Improved methodology that distinguishes and quantifies the functional contribution of each component of a tetravalent vaccine would allow for improvements in estimates of vaccine immunogenicity, for a more precise correlate of protection, and for a powerful investigational tool to study vaccine success and failure.To that end, we propose to develop a novel approach to measure the functional contributions of serotype-specific antibodies against the backdrop of a highly cross-reactive tetravalent polyclonal response. A panel of reporter virus particles (RVPs) containing mutations that destroy antibody-binding determinants will be used to identify functionally important epitopes that elicit type-specific or cross-reactive antibodies present in the serum of DENV vaccinees. An iterative screening process will guide selection of RVPs that are either no longer sensitive to neutralization by cross-reactive antibodies or type-specific responses. RVPs with these characteristics provide two complementary and specific methods for detecting type-specific responses in polyclonal sera as described below.  These tools will then be employed to characterize the epitopes that comprise the neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated or naturally infected humans.',\n",
       " 'Internal death programs play significant roles in many diseases.  Pathogenic effects can result from inefficient cell death or from inappropriate or excessive death such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during AIDS or the SAR-CoV virus during SARS. In this project, we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular mechanisms of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death programs in lymphocytes as well as other cell types. A major focus of our investigations are death-inducing cell surface receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as TNFR1 and CD95/Fas/APO-1.  Both receptors play an important role in stimulating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death of cells principally in immune processes. Little is known about how these alternative death pathways are entrained to receptor signaling.  Interestingly, both receptors can have effects beside death such as the induction of transcription factors. We are trying to understand how these receptors stimulate the intracellular machinery that causes cell death in preference to other cellular outcomes. We have devoted many of our efforts  to understanding the activation of a protease called caspase-8 which regulates the death program. We have characterized two death programs that emanate from TNFR1 and the Fas receptor, one which is caspase-8 dependent and has an apoptotic morphology and the other which is caspase-8 independent and involves necrosis. Interestingly, the latter death program is only observed when caspase-8 is inhibited. The regulation and molecular pathways of these two forms of lymphocyte death are distinct. In addition, we have discovered that inhibition of caspase-8 in non-lymphoid cells can lead to another form of cell death  exhibiting particular cytoplasmic double membrane structures called autophagy.  Although initially controversial, several labs have now shown that this form of death is particularly important for the demise of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. We have now shown that the mechanism of autophagic death program is selective degradation of catalase which leads to a marked overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage and death. Furthermore, we have focused on genes that play key roles in this process of death.  We have found that the human homologue of the Drosophila spinster protein, called hSpin, is essential for autophagic cell death.  We have studied the biochemical function of this protein and found that it is important for proper lysosome biogenesis and vesicle trafficking. In particular, it plays a vital role in lysosomal resomation at the end of  autophagy.  These studies will shed light on nonapoptotic death mechanisms.\\tIn parallel, we are exploring how the regulation of cellular death programs may play a role in cytopathicity associated with virus infections in AIDS and SARS.  In particular, a critical effect in the onset of AIDS following infection with HIV is the death of T lymphocytes caused by the virus. We have found that this death process is necrotic rather than apoptotic and have now identified two viral gene products, vif and vpr, that are involved in this process. We have found that vpr alters the cell cycle and promote death by binding to cellular proteins that have a role in cell cycle progression.  In order to study this process rigorously we have constructed a mathematical model to analyze cell death in tissue culture during HIV infection. Remarkably, both of these cytotoxic gene products cause says cycle arrest at the boundary of the G2 and M phases. The mathematical model reveals that the principal cause of cell loss is cell death rather than cell cycle arrest. We are using molecular genetic approaches to determine if cell cycle arrest actually causes cell death and how this might come about. The HIV vpr protein is a small protein (100 amino acids) with no obvious structural domains or enzymatic motifs other than three alpha helices.  We have determined that vpr promotes the formation of an apparently abortive complex between mitotic regulators such as CyclinB and Cdk1, and the theta isoform of the 14-3-3 protein which inhibits the cell cycle in the G2 phase.  The complex appears to be nucleated by a particular hydrophobic patch on the third helix of the vpr protein. We have also studied how vif causes cell cycle arrest and found that it is a distinctive mechanism from that induced by vpr.  We find that vif can alter the nucleocytoplasmic localization of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases which leads to disruption of normal cell cycle progression.  We continue to explore how HIV-1 alters to cellular  machinery to cause the demise of CD4 T cells.In contrast to HIV, the human coronavirus that causes SARS, SARS-CoV, causes necrotic cell death that does not involve cell cycle arrest.  We have found that cell death can be traced to a novel open reading frame, termed ORF 3a, that is present in SARS-CoV but not other less pathological human coronaviruses.  The cellular effect of ORF3a is to cause a dramatic reorganization of the Golgi apparatus which has lethal effects on the cell.  We are now trying to established a molecular pathway entrained to ORF3a that causes this cytopathic effect.  Thus far,  our data implicate the TGN38 protein that is primarily found in the trans portion of the Golgi as the main direct target of the ORF3a protein.  Further experiments will be directed at understanding the mechanism of how SARS triggers a lethal event through the alteration of the Golgi apparatus. Our explorations have revealed that the SARS virus causes cell death by a unique process involving Golgi apparatus disintegration which is also seen in nonlymphoid cells infected by other cytopathic viruses. The ORF3a encoded by SARS-CoV directly provokes Golgi disintegration. Understanding the molecular mechanism of this process may lead to valuable insights into viral cytopathicity. Also, SARS-CoV induced cell death might involve the ORF-3b protein.  In examining ORFb, which, along with ORF3a is unique to SARS-CoV and not found in less pathogenic human coronaviruses, we found that it exhibited a novel form of temporal translocation of the protein between the mitochondria and the cell nucleus. Preliminary evidence suggests that it has an inimical effect on the normal interferon response against viral infection and we are currently exploring the molecular basis of this effect.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection is being determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed.Once chronicity has been established treatment response rates decrease significantly. One of the hallmarks of the hepatitis C virus is its sequence diversity, which is used to classify hepatitis C into different genotypes. Different genotypes have different response rates to treatment. Response rates are typically higher in genotype 2/3. Protocol 03-DK-0136 studies the response of patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotypes 2 or 3, to a decreased dose of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin. 30 patients were treated with low-dose peginterferon alfa-2a (90 g/week) and 23 patients with standard doses (180 g/week) for 24 weeks in combination with 800 mg/day of ribavirin. Patients who failed treatment were offered 48 weeks of standard-dose treatment. Viral and serum IP-10 levels were measured and early viral kinetic parameters were calculated. Sustained virological response was achieved in 68% of the low-dose and 84% of the standard-dose treated patients (per-protocol, p=0.81 for non-inferiority). Retreatment was successful in all patients who tolerated full dose and duration. The standard-dose group had a greater first phase decline of the viral levels and faster time to negativity. The second phase slope was not affected by peginterferon dose. Although fatigue and general feeling during treatment were worse for standard dose, hematologic toxicity and depression did not differ between groups. Treatment with a lower dose of peginterferon is associated with some symptomatic benefit but the response is not equivalent to standard dosing. A second study for chronic hepatitis C was performed to assess the mechanism of action of ribavirin in HCV. This was done as protocol 02-DK-0065. Microarray analysis has shown that ribavirin may enhance induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The aim was to evaluate early viral kinetics, serum cytokine expression and viral mutagenesis during peginterferon treatment with and without ribavirin. 50 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1 infection were randomized to receive peginterferon-alfa-2a with or without ribavirin for the 1st month of treatment. All patients then received 48 weeks of combination therapy. First and 2nd phase viral kinetics were evaluated. Serum IP10, MIG and MCP1 levels, representative of ISG response, were measured. Sequencing of part of NS5A and NS5B was performed and mutation rates were calculated. It was found that first phase decline was similar between groups. Patients receiving ribavirin had more rapid 2nd phase kinetics, particularly those with a good 1st phase decline (0.61 vs 0.37 log10 IU/mlmL/week, p=0.026). Induction of serum IP10 at 12 hrs was higher in patients receiving ribavirin than those receiving peginterferon alone (7.6 vs 3.8 fold, p=0.01); however like 2nd phase slope, the difference was more apparent in those with a good 1st phase decline. IP10-induction correlated with 1st and 2nd phase kinetics only in patients who received ribavirin. Sequencing analysis revealed similar mutation rates in both groups. It was concluded that ribavirin improves early viral kinetics, but only in those patients with an initial response to peginterferon. Greater induction of interferon-stimulated cytokines and the correlation with viral kinetics in ribavirin-treated patients, support the notion that ribavirin may act through augmentation of interferon signaling.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years.',\n",
       " 'In the past year, we have advanced the objectives of this project along several lines. (1) Development of a reverse genetics system. Three years ago, Komoto et al (2006) described a helper virus-dependent, single-gene replacement reverse genetics system for rotavirus. This system used a replication-deficient vaccinia virus (rDIs-T7pol) as the source of T7 RNA polymerase (T7pol) to drive the transcription of a SA11 rotavirus VP4 gene from a transfected cDNA plasmid. Infection of the transfected cells with a helper rotavirus (KU strain) allowed for the recovery of recombinant viruses that had incorporated the SA11 VP4 gene into the KU genome. Shortly thereafter, Kobayashi et al (2007) reported the development of a fully plasmid-based reverse genetic system for reovirus, another segmented dsRNA virus in the Reoviridae family. In this system, 10 plasmids, each of which contains the cDNA of an authentic reovirus gene behind a T7 promoter and upstream of an HDV ribozyme, are transfected into murine cells (L929) infected with rDIs-T7pol. Viral transcripts made from the cDNAs launch the production of recombinant infectious virus, with yields reaching 10 to 100 PFU per transfected 60-mm well (10ex6 cells). We have been successful in developing a helper virus-dependent, single-gene replacement reverse genetics system for rotavirus using an approach reminiscent of that described by Komoto et al (2006). The design and efficiency of the system is such that is can be used to modify many if not all of the rotaviruses genes. We have continued attempts to establish a fully plasmid-based reverse genetics system to rotavirus. As part of that effort, we have set up and successfully used the plasmid-based reovirus reverse genetics system. (2) In previous studies, we showed that rotavirus subverts IFN signaling by the action of its nonstructural protein NSP1. Specifically, we learned that NSP1 has the potential to interact with multiple members of the IRF family of proteins. This interaction is correlated with the degradation of IRF protein (e.g., IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7) in infected cells, via a proteasome-dependent process. This degradation prevents rotavirus-infected cells from expressing IFN.In recent studies, we found that the ability of rotavirus NSP1 to degrade IFN-signaling targets varies among different virus strains.  For example, the NSP1 of some virus strains were shown to degrade three IRF proteins: IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 (si SA11-4F, si RRV, mu ETD, po Gottfried); others two IRF proteins: IRF3 and IRF7 (bo UK) or IRF3 and IRF5 (la 30-96). At least one other virus (po OSU) failed to degrade any of these IRF proteins, but was capable of degrading beta-TRCP, a factor necessary for the activation of NF-kB. Moreover, we found that individual types of NSP1 may vary in their ability to degrade an IFN-signaling target as a factor of the species origin of the target. For example, NSP1 of the bo UK virus can degrade simian IRF3, but not human IRF3. Finally, we found that the type of cell used in NSP1 functional assays also impacts the ability of NSP1 to degrade an IFN-signaling target. As an example, transfection experiments have shown that NSP1 of po Gottfried rotavirus can degrade hu IRF3 expressed in human and simian cells, but not in porcine cells. The  differences noted for the activities of NSP1 are perhaps not surprising given the remarkable sequence variation of the protein among different virus strains. (3) Analysis of the diversity and evolution of the rotavirus genome. The scarcity of complete genome sequence information for the rotaviruses prevents a comprehensive molecular analysis of rotavirus diversity and evolution, limits our capacity to assess the impact of rotavirus vaccines on the genetic make-up of viruses circulating in the human population, and undermines the full potential of reverse genetics systems. To address the need for additional sequence information, we have initiated several large scale genomic sequencing projects (a)-(c). (a) An important question is whether the widespread use of the RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccines will induce antigenic and/or genetic changes in commonly circulating rotaviruses or will lead to the emergence of new G-type strains not covered by the vaccines. To address this question, we initiated a project to sequence the complete genomes of rotaviruses in stool samples that were collected from 160 sick children at Vanderbilt Medical Center (Nashville, TN) during the 2005-06 to 2008-09 winter seasons. The four seasons covered by these samples are particularly significant as they include seasons prior to and after the RotaTeq vaccine was introduced into the Nashville community. The sequence data will be examined for evidence that vaccine usage induces shifts in the equilibrium of co-circulating G/P-type viruses and changes to the antigenic epitopes of the VP4 and VP7 proteins of circulating strains.(b) To gain insight into the diversity and evolution of human rotaviruses circulating in a single location over a long period of time, we sequenced 51 G3P8 rotaviruses isolated from sick children during 1974 to 1991 at Childrens Hospital National Medical Center, Washington DC.   The results from this study revealed for the first time that genetically-distinct rotavirus clades of the same G/P-type, but with varying neutralization epitopes, can co-circulate and cause disease. The findings also indicate that although genome reassortment can occur among RVs, most reassortant strains are replaced overtime by lineages with preferred gene constellations. Thus, the  G3P8 population is dynamic and in flux, in part driven by the competing pressures to maintain ideal gene constellations while increasing genetic diversity via reassortment. (c) Dr. Albert Kapikian and colleagues in the LID developed a multivalent rotavirus vaccine through reassortment of a panel of antigenically-distinct human rotaviruses with a bovine rotavirus (UK BRV vaccine). This live attenuated virus vaccine includes six reassorts differing in the serotype (G1, G2, G3, G4, G8, or G9) of their outer capsid component VP7.  Master seed lots were prepared for each reassortant by the NIH (NIH Master Seeds), and then distributed to several companies interested in producing rotavirus vaccines at low cost in developing counties. As part of their program to develop the vaccine, one company has generated their own Master Seeds (Shantha) from the NIH Master Seeds, and then passed their Master Seed subsequently to produce Working Batches and Production Batches of each viral component of the UK BRV vaccine. To support the production and widespread use of low-cost effective rotavirus vaccines, we have agreed to sequence the genomes of the Master Seeds and the Working and Production Batches generated by the companies. This information is necessary to provide safety information concerning the genetic stability of the virus components during vaccine production. In the past year, we sequenced 13 complete genomes and parts of 11 other genomes of the viruses in the Master Seeds or Working or Production Batches. In total, 176 viral genes were sequenced. GenBank accession numbers were obtained for all sequenced genes. This information is being shared with all the vaccine producers to assist in seeking regulatory approval for using the vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Dengue serotype 1 vaccine development: The live attenuated DEN1 vaccine candidate virus rDEN1del30 has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and was found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies have been fully enrolled to determine the number of doses and the timing of the two doses needed to achieve optimal immunization. The studies involve two doses of vaccine given at an interval of 4 or 6 months. The results will be fully reported pending complete analysis, but preliminary analysis indicates that the first dose is highly immunogenic but the second dose is poorly infectious at 6 months. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned. Dengue serotype 2 vaccine development: rDEN2/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine, rDEN4del30, have been replaced by those of the prototypic DEN2 NGC virus. The live attenuated DEN2 vaccine candidate virus rDEN2/4del30(ME) has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies are in progress to address the number and timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate.  Enrollment is not complete, and results of the trial will be reported pending completion. Trials to determine the human infectious dose 50 are planned. Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development; rDEN3/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine rDEN430 have been replaced by those of a DEN3 wild type virus. rDEN3/4del30(ME) or placebo was evaluated at a dose of 1,000 or 100,000 PFU in 28 healthy dengue-naive adult volunteers per dose. Less than 40% of vaccinees were infected with either dose indicating this vaccine candidate is not sufficiently infectious to be used as a component of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Studies have been initiated with an additional DEN3 vaccine candidate in which the DEN3-UTR (untranslated region) has been replaced with that of DEN4del30, and initial trials indicate the virus is safe and more infectious than rDEN3/4del30(ME) and that it can be used as the DEN3 component of a tetravalent  vaccine. Dengue serotype 4 vaccine development: rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 is a live attenuated DENV-4 vaccine candidate specifically designed to further attenuate the rDEN4&#8710;30 parent virus.  In a previous study, 5 of 20 vaccinees who received rDEN4&#8710;30 at 100,000 PFU developed moderately elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT).  Mutational analysis of DENV-4 revealed that the 200,201 mutation of NS5 greatly restricted virus replication in human hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cells.  In pre-clinical animal studies, the vaccine candidate rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 was shown to be more attenuated than rDEN4&#8710;30 in both SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus macaques. In the present study, twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive either 100,000 PFU of vaccine (20) or placebo (8) as a single subcutaneous injection.  The vaccine infected all vaccinees and was well tolerated without inducing ALT elevations.  Although virus was not recovered from the serum of any vaccinee, moderate levels of neutralizing antibody were induced.  The restricted replication of rDEN430-200,201 in SCID HuH-7 mice and rhesus monkeys was also observed in humans, thus validating the pre-clinical approach of selecting a mutant virus with a decreased level of replication in human liver cells.  rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 is a promising candidate and can be considered for inclusion in a tetravalent DEN virus vaccine. We currently consider the rDEN4del30 vaccine our DEN4 leading candidate for inclusion in the tetravalent vaccine for two reasons. At a proposed dose of 1000 PFU, it is economical to produce and has an acceptable safety profile; and, rDEN4del30 appears slightly more immunogenic in humans than rDEN4del30-200,201; this greater immunogenicity likely would translate into a more durable immunity. A second candidate is rDEN4del30-4995. rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 is a live attenuated dengue virus type 4 (DEN4) vaccine candidate specifically designed as a further attenuated derivative of the rDEN4&#8710;30 parent virus.   In a previous study, 5/20 vaccinees who received 100,000 plaque forming units (PFU) of rDEN4&#8710;30 developed a transient serum ALT elevation and 10/20 developed an asymptomatic maculopapular rash.  In the current study, 28 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive 100,000 PFU of rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 (20) or placebo (8) as a single subcutaneous injection.  The vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. An asymptomatic generalized maculopapular rash and elevations in ALT levels were observed in 10% of the rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 vaccinees. None of the rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 volunteers became viremic, yet 95% developed a four-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers.  Thus rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 was demonstrated to be safe, highly attenuated, and immunogenic. However, an asymptomatic localized erythematous rash at the injection site was seen in 17/20 rDEN4&#8710;30-4995 vaccinees, and, therefore, alternative DEN4 vaccine strains were selected for further clinical development.  Two tetravalent formulations will be evaluated in humans in the next FY.  One will consist of rDEN1del30, rDEN2/4del30(ME), rDEN3-3Ddel30, and DEN4-del30 and the second will have rDEN4&#8710;30-200,201 as the DEN4 component.  An additional study designed to evaluate the safety of our DEN vaccine viruses in subjects immune to a heterologous dengue virus has been completed, and the data is being analyzed. Preliminary analysis of this trial, in which four combinations of heterologous first and second vaccines were studied, indicated that the vaccine viruses were infectious, safe, and immunogenic in the presence of preexisting heterologous immunity.  Only one of the four combinations showed increased replication of vaccine virus, an expected finding in which preexisting immunity enhances virus replication, but this small increase in viremia was not accompanied by an increase in signs or symptoms of dengue virus disease. West Nile virus vaccine development  trials in humans: Phase I trials are ongoing with a live attenuated West Nile virus vaccine candidate, WNVDEN4del30. Studies at 1000 and 100,000 infectious units per vaccinee indicated the vaccine was safe with low viremia, but was immunogenic in only 80% of vaccinees. To achieve a higher take rate, a study is ongoing in which two doses of 100,000 infectious units are given six months apart.  The study is fully enrolled, and preliminary analysis indicates that the vaccine given as two doses is safe and immunogenic with up to 100% of vaccinees developing a rise in neutralizing antibody titer.',\n",
       " 'The Respiratory Viruses Section entered into a CRADA with MedImmune in 2006 to develop live attenuated virus vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) subgroups A and B, human parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1-3), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV).  None of the ongoing studies have been completed, so there are no results to report.  The following is a summary of the testing to date.HPIV1 vaccine: Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) is responsible for approximately 6% of pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory tract disease with significant illness occurring predominantly in infants and young children, and therefore a vaccine is needed. The rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) live attenuated virus vaccine was generated for intranasal immunization.  The C(del170) mutation conferred a significant level of attenuation in hamsters and African green monkeys (AGMs) that closely resembled that of the CF170S mutation and will be of particular utility for vaccine development because it involves a deletion of six nucleotides rendering it highly refractory to reversion.  The combination of the CR84G/HNT553A mutation set and the C170 deletion mutation yielded a virus designated rCR84G/170HNT553A that exhibited a satisfactory level of attenuation in hamsters and AGMs and was immunogenic and highly protective against HPIV1 wt challenge.  A derivative of the rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A) has been developed by the addition of a genetically stabilized ts att mutation in L to this recombinant. The L(Y942A)  mutation is a substitution at amino acid position 942 of L that was engineered for increased genetic and phenotypic stability by the strategy of identifying a codon whose amino acid assignment yielded a ts att phenotype and which would require three nucleotide substitutions to revert to a codon that specifies a wt phenotype.  The rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) live attenuated virus vaccine candidate has been given to 35 seropositive adult volunteers.  Only 4 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts.  The virus is safe to proceed to the next group of seropositive younger subjects. HPIV2 vaccine: A live attenuated intranasal HPIV2 vaccine was generated using reverse genetic technology in a manner analogous to that for HPIV1 described above and was found to be immunogenic and protective in African green monkeys. The rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 vaccine candidate has been given to 15 seropositive adult volunteers.  Only 4 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts. The virus is safe to proceed to the next group of seropositive younger subjects. HPIV3 vaccine: There are two HPIV3 vaccine studies that are ongoing.  First, clinical studies have been initiated with the bovine-human chimeric recombinant PIV that contains the HPIV3 HN and F protective antigens as replacements for the corresponding genes on a bovine PIV3 backbone (BPIV3).  The rB/HPIV3 contains multiple attenuating BPIV3 genes. These studies are not complete so the results cannot be reported.  Studies have been completed in seropositive adults (# =15) and seropositive older children (# = 10).  Minimal shedding was seen in both populations and the virus was found safe to proceed to seronegative older children.  These studies have been initiated, but recruitment is slow. The second candidate is HPIV3cp45. The biologically derived HPIV3cp45 vaccine candidate was found to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility.  Therefore, LID focused on deriving a HPIV3cp45 seed virus from cDNA that could be transferred to an industrial partner for eventual manufacture once efficacy was established.  We established a reverse genetics system in which appropriate DNAs were electroporated into qualified Vero cells yielding rHPIV3cp45 virus with a known pedigree. A vaccine lot was manufactured using this seed material.  In 2006, Medimmune entered into a CRADA with LID, and the LID HPIV3cp45 vaccine lot is currently being evaluated by LID and by Medimmune under this CRADA. LID has found that the cDNA-derived HPIV3cp45 vaccine replicates to over 7log10 TCID50/ml in Vero cells. A two dose vaccine regimen was tested in 10 6-12 month old seronegative infants and was found to be highly infectious, safe, and immunogenic (9 of 10 with antibody response) in the subjects. Thus, rHPIV3cp45 is highly infectious and immunogenic at 5log10 in seronegative older infants indicating the economic feasibility of this vaccine candidate.  Only one of ten rHPIV3cp45 vaccinees was infected with the second dose given 1-2 months later indicating that a high level of resistance to re-infection was induced by this vaccine.  A two dose study with rHPIV3cp45 in 2 month old subjects at 100,000 pfu is planned, and a two dose study is seronegative subjects older than six months is planned with the second dose given 6 months after the first dose.  Two Phase 2b proof of principle efficacy studies with a RSV subgroup A vaccine candidate and with rHPIV3cp45, have been initiated. RSV vaccine:  Medimmune has initiated studies under the CRADA leading up to a Phase IIb proof of principle efficacy trial with a recombinant rRSV containing a set of at least five independent mutations that contribute to attenuation.  LID is also manufacturing two clinical lots of RSV subgroup A virus containing a deletion in M2-2 or NS1 gene.HMPV vaccine: LID is manufacturing two clinical lots of HMPV vaccine live attenuated virus vaccines.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. A single polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and at least seven non-structural proteins. The genome organization of the DEN viruses is 5-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3 (UTR  untranslated region, C  capsid, prM  membrane precursor, E  envelope, NS  nonstructural). There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) that circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million dengue infections and hundreds of thousands of cases of the more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) with children bearing much of the disease burden. DEN viruses are endemic in at least 100 countries and cause more human disease than any other mosquito-borne virus. In at least eight Asian countries, the DEN viruses are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Unfortunately, many countries affected by DEN viruses have very limited financial resources for healthcare, and the economic burden of DEN disease is considerable. As such, an economical vaccine that prevents disease caused by the DEN viruses is a global public health priority.The cost-effectiveness, safety, long-term immunity, and efficacy associated with the live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus, serves as a model for the feasibility of a live attenuated DEN virus vaccine. However, the development of a live attenuated dengue vaccine has been complicated by several factors. First, it has been difficult to develop monovalent vaccines against each of the four serotypes that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Second, an effective live attenuated dengue virus vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation of components representing each serotype because multiple serotypes typically co-circulate in a region, each DEN serotype is capable of causing disease, and the introduction of additional serotypes is common. In addition, the association of increased disease severity (DHFDSS) in previously infected persons undergoing an infection by a different dengue serotype necessitates a vaccine that will confer long-term protection against all four serotypes. Third, it has been difficult to formulate a tetravalent vaccine with low reactogenicity that induces a broad neutralizing antibody response against each DEN serotype. Fourth, a dengue vaccine must confer protection against a wide range of genetically diverse subtypes that are dispersed around the world and can be readily introduced into a new region by international travel. Fifth, a dengue vaccine must be produced economically so that it can be made available to populations that need it most. We have tried to address these issues as part of a program to generate a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. To maximize the likelihood that suitable vaccine candidates would be identified, monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN1-4 were generated by two distinct recombinant methods and found to be attenuated and immunogenic in mouse and rhesus monkey models. In one method, deletion of 30 contiguous nucleotides from the 3 UTR of wild type cDNA clones of DEN1-4 was used to generate vaccine candidates. Specifically, the deletion of nucleotides 10478-10507 of the 3 UTR (del30) of recombinant wild type DEN4 yielded a vaccine candidate, rDEN4del30, which is safe, attenuated, and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and humans. Incorporation of the del30 mutation into infectious cDNA clones of DEN1, but not DEN2 or DEN3, at a site homologous to that in DEN4 attenuated this virus for rhesus monkeys. Using a second method, antigenic chimeric viruses were generated by replacing wild type M and E structural genes of rDEN4del30 with those from DEN2 or DEN3, and the resulting chimeric viruses were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys.  The dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time.  The preclinical phase of this program is currently devoted largely to support the manufacture of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in volunteers. Multiple clinical lots of dengue 1-4 have been manufactured over the past year, focusing largely on the DEN3 vaccine candidates and a new lot of DEN4del30. Dengue serotype 1 and -2 vaccine development. The attenuation phenotype of rDEN1del30 and rDEN2/4&#8710;30 in SCID-HuH-7 mice, rhesus monkeys, and mosquitoes and the protective immunity observed in rhesus monkeys formed the basis for evaluation of virus in clinical trials. Further pre-clinical research with DEN1 and DEN2 vaccine candidates are on hold pending outcome of ongoing clinical studies with the lead rDEN1del30 and rDEN2/4&#8710;30 candidates that continue to look good in clinical trials with up to 90 vaccinees receiving either vaccine. Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development: The dengue virus type 3 (DEN3) vaccine candidate, rDEN3/4del30, was previously found to be infectious, attenuated, and immunogenic in SCID-HuH-7 mice or rhesus monkeys, but was found to have decreased infectivity for humans.  An additional, similarly designed DEN3 chimeric virus, based on a DEN3 wild type virus of greater virulence (a Sri Lanka strain of DEN3) than the donor (Slemons strain) of the M and E genes in clinically tested chimeric rDEN3/4del30 virus, was generated.  The Sri Lanka rDEN3/4del30 was found to have a monkey infectious dose 50 similar to that of the Slemonds rDEN3/4del30.  Therefore rDEN3/4del30 Sri Lnaka was not considered sufficiently more infectious to be tested in humans.  As reported last year, two strategies have been employed to generate attenuated rDEN3 vaccine candidates that retain the full complement of structural and nonstructural proteins of DEN3 and thus are able to induce humoral or cellular immunity to each of the DEN3 proteins.  First, using the predicted secondary structure of the DEN3 3 untranslated region (3-UTR), a novel deletion mutant was designed containing both the del 30 mutation and an additional del31 mutation and was found to be highly attenuated yet immunogenic in monkeys.  Second, chimeric rDEN3 viruses were generated by replacement of the 3-UTR of the rDEN3 cDNA clone with that of rDEN4 or rDEN4del30 yielding the rDEN3-3D4 and rDEN3-3D4del30 viruses, respectively.  Immunization of rhesus monkeys with either of two mutant viruses, rDEN3del30/31 or rDEN3-3D4del30, resulted in infection without detectable viremia, with each virus inducing a strong neutralizing antibody response capable of conferring protection from DEN3 challenge.  The rDEN3del30/31 virus showed a strong host range restriction phenotype with complete loss of replication in C6/36 mosquito cells despite robust replication in Vero cells.  In addition, rDEN3del30/31 had reduced replication in Toxorynchites mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation.  Clinical lots of the rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN3-3D4del30 have been manufactured, and INDs have submitted.  Phase 1 clinical trials with rDEN3-3D4del30 have begun and those with rDEN3del30/31 should start within four months. Efforts to develop a live attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine have been initiated.',\n",
       " 'H5N1 cold-adapted (ca) vaccines: Three candidate vaccines were developed based on H5N1 viruses isolated in 1997, 2003 and 2004. In each virus, the HA and NA genes were derived from wild-type H5N1 viruses, and the six internal protein gene segments came from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold-adapted (ca) master donor virus. The HA in each case was modified to remove the multibasic amino acid cleavage site that is a virulence motif. We performed open-label trials to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of H5N1 VN 2004 AA ca and H5N1 HK 2003 AA ca. The H5N1 VN 2004 AA ca vaccine virus was evaluated at dosages of 106.7 TCID50 and 107.5 TCID50, and the H5N1 HK 2003 AA ca vaccine was evaluated at a dosage of 107.5 TCID50.  Two doses were administered intranasally to healthy adults in isolation at 4 to 8 week intervals.  Vaccine safety was assessed through daily examinations, and infectivity was assessed by viral culture and by realtime reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasal wash (NW) specimens. Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and IgG or IgA antibodies to recombinant (r)H5 VN 2004 hemagglutinin (HA) in serum or NW.\\tFifty-nine participants were enrolled:  21 received 106.7 TCID50 and 21 received 107.5 TCID50 of H5N1 VN 2004 AA ca and 17 received H5N1 HK 2003 AA ca.  Shedding of vaccine virus was minimal, as were HI and neutralizing antibody responses.  Fifty-two percent of recipients of 107.5 TCID50 of H5N1 VN 2004 AA ca developed a serum IgA response to rH5 VN 2004 HA. The live attenuated H5N1 VN 2004 and HK 2003 AA ca vaccines bearing avian H5 HA antigens were very restricted in replication and were more attenuated than seasonal LAIV bearing human H1, H3 or B HA antigens. The H5N1 AA ca LAIV elicited serum ELISA antibody but not HI or neutralizing antibody responses in healthy adults. H7N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, a Phase I study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H7N3 ca vaccine. The H7N3 BC 2004/AA ca virus is a live attenuated, cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive influenza virus derived by reverse genetics from the wild-type low pathogenicity avian influenza virus A/chicken/British Columbia/CN-6/2004 (H7N3) and the A/AA/6/60 ca (H2N2) virus. We evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of 107.5 TCID50 of the vaccine administered by nasal spray 5 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adult volunteers in an inpatient isolation unit. The subjects were followed for 2 months after 1 dose of vaccine or for 4 weeks after the second dose. \\t Twenty-one subjects received the first dose of the vaccine, and 17 subjects received two doses. The vaccine was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. The vaccine was highly restricted in replication: 6 (29%) subjects had virus recoverable by culture or by rRT-PCR after the first dose. Replication of vaccine virus was not detected following the second dose. Despite the restricted replication of the vaccine, 90% of the subjects developed an antibody response as measured by any assay: 62% by HI assay, 48% by microneutralization assay, 48% by ELISA for H7 HA-specific serum IgG or 71% by ELISA for H7 HA-specific serum IgA, after either one or two doses. Following the first dose, vaccine-specific IgG secreting cells as measured by ELISPOT increased from a mean of 0.1 to 41.6/1,000,000 PBMCs; vaccine specific IgA secreting cells increased from 2 to 16.4/1,000,000 PBMCs. The antibody secreting cell response after the second dose was less vigorous, which is consistent with the observed low replication of vaccine virus after the second dose and consequent lower antigenic stimulation. The live attenuated H7N3 vaccine was well tolerated but was highly restricted in replication in healthy seronegative adults. Despite the restricted replication, the vaccine was immunogenic, with serum IgA being the most sensitive measure of immunogenicity. A study to evaluate the safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine was planned. However, the study was not initiated as planned because the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus appeared and has continued to circulate in the community.H2N2 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: H2N2 viruses caused the 1957 influenza pandemic and circulated in humans until 1968 when they were replaced by H3N2 viruses. Although H2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. An H2 vaccine is a high priority in preparing for a pandemic because H2 viruses have a proven capability for causing disease in humans and persons born after 1968 lack H2-specific immunity. Because the currently licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine utilized in the United States bears the internal protein genes of the influenza A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus, the A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus was a logical first choice for evaluation as an H2 vaccine candidate. However, this virus with the H2 HA and N2 NA has not been evaluated in seronegative people. An IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) virus. Twenty-one subjects received the first dose and 18 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H6N1 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H6N1 ca vaccine based on A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1). Twenty-two subjects received the first dose and 18 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S. and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza cases are also very significant resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths in the US annually.It is important to develop clinical natural history studies to compare natural infections with the new H1N1 pandemic virus with those from seasonal influenza viruses. The major goal of this project is to evaluate the natural history of pandemic influenza virus infection in comparison to infection with seasonal influenza viruses in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients.  We plan to recruit up to 1000 patients with pandemic or seasonal influenza virus infection. Recruitment will occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings at multiple sites including the NIH Clinical Center, Suburban Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center. Careful clinical evaluation, analysis of viruses collected from patients, and studies of the immune response of the patients will be performed.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): APOBEC3 (A3) proteins are host cellular proteins that confer intrinsic immunity to viral infections. Human have seven A3 proteins, including human A3 (hA3G) and hA3F. hA3G restricts infection of cells in culture by Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), primate foamy virus (PFV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In contrast to humans, the mouse genome encodes a single A3 gene (mA3) which restrict infection by HIV-1, MuLV, and MMTV. Recently, we provided the first in vivo evidence that A3 is an antiviral restriction factor. By comparing MMTV infection in mice deficient in mA3 and their mA3-sufficient counterparts, we showed that mA3 restricted infection by this virus in vivo. More recently, we showed that mA3 restricts MMTV infection in dendritic cells (DCs), the initial targets of infection by many retroviruses. The studies proposed here will take advantage of the MMTV-mA3 model system to explore the relationship between mA3 and MMTV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. Recently, it has been shown that a number of cytokines induce expression of hA3G and hA3F in cultured cells. It is well-established that MMTV induces cytokine production at two steps in the infection pathway: first, when the virus envelope protein interacts with the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and second, when virus-infected antigen presenting cells such as DCs present the viral superantigen (Sag) to T cells. Thus, it is likely that MMTV infection also triggers cellular expression of mA3. Using ex vivo cultures of DCs from mA3-/- and mA3+/+ mice, we will investigate if cytokine treatment induces mA3 expression and the effect of such induction on MMTV infection. We will also carry out animal studies and examine cytokine induction, mA3 expression and virus restriction in vivo. To determine at which step in the infection pathway mA3 is induced, we will use mice lacking mA3, MyD88, TRIP and TLR4 genes and mice unable to respond to the viral Sag protein. Because of its antiviral properties, higher mA3 expression during the early stages of infection may serve to allow the host's immune system time to limit virus infection.     RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will use MMTV-mA3 model system to explore the regulatory mechanism(s) of mA3 and its interaction with the broader immune system. Indeed, it has been suggested that increasing hA3G expression through the use of agents that induce cytokine production could be used as an anti-HIV-1 therapy. Thus our studies will increase understanding of the cross-talk between A3 and the immune system and will set the stage for the use of this protein as a means of developing new anti-retroviral therapies\",\n",

Given the lack of available data for Puerto Rico, this study aims to determine the prevalence of cervical, anal and concurrent cervical/anal HPV infection and factors associated to HPV anogenital infection among a population-based sample of 600 women aged 18 to 64 years living in the San Juan, Metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, using a self-sampling collection methodology previously tested in a clinic-based sample population. In addition, we aim to determine the concordance of HPV types in the anus and cervix among infected women and to explore the frequency distribution of HPV variants among women with concurrent infection with HPV types 16, 18 and 31. A face-to-face interview and a computer-assisted self-interview (Audio CASI system) will collect information on risk factors for HPV infection including demographic characteristics and lifestyles. Anal and cervical specimens will be collected using Dracon swabs, which will be placed in separate 5-mL vials containing 1 mL Qiagen Specimen Sample Transport Medium (Qiagen Corp.) after collection. HPV DNA testing will be performed at the University of California, San Francisco, using a modified pool of MY09/MY11 consensus HPV L1 primers as well as primers for amplification of the human beta-globin gene. PCR products from positive samples will be typed by dot-blot hybridization using 39 individual type-specific probes. Strain variant typing from the E6 region will also be done. HPV-DNA prevalence will be calculated by HPV-type and all types combined. Crude and covariate adjusted Prevalence Odds will be estimated by logistic regression models. Three different logistic regression models will be constructed to evaluate factors associated with the following infection status: 1) anus HPV+/cervix HPV- , 2) anus HPV-/cervix HPV+, and 3) anus HPV+/cervix HPV+. On each of these models, women negative for both anal and cervical HPV infection (anal HPV-/ cervix HPV-) will be used as the reference group. Concordance of HPV-type among HPV infected individuals will be assessed by the kappa statistic and the concordance rate. This study will provide insights on the epidemiology of anogenital HPV infection and it will explore the distribution of HPV 16, 18 and 31 variants in this population in Puerto Rican women. This information is relevant to identify groups of population at risk for HPV infection and related anogenital cancers and to assess the impact of HPV vaccine programs.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will be the first to estimate the prevalence of anogenital and concurrent (anus and cervix) HPV infection, to describe the distribution of HPV types, and to assess factors associated with HPV anogenital infection in a population-based sample of Puerto Rican women. In addition we will explore the distribution of HPV 16, 18 and 31 variants in this population. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to assess anal infection among a homogenous Hispanic population in the U.S. This study will provide insights on the epidemiology of HPV infection and of the relationship between anal and cervical HPV infection in this population, information that will contribute to the development of future studies of the etiology and transmission dynamics of HPV infection in Puerto Rico. Further, it will allow us to explore the burden of HPV types currently included (6, 11, 16 and 18) and not included in the available vaccines. These assessments are necessary to understand the burden of HPV in this population, to identify groups at risk for HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV related malignancies, and to determine the impact of vaccine programs. Information on the distribution of HPV types at anogenital sites will also guide the development of effective primary and secondary prevention interventions to reduce the burden of HPV infection and anogenital cancers among the Puerto Rican population and will aid in the design and implementation of future HPV vaccines and vaccine studies in the island.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An adequate medical response to the threat of pandemic influenza includes surveillance and isolation, a sufficient supply of effective antiviral drugs, and rapid development of a protective vaccine. Under optimal circumstances, production of enough vaccine to protect the US population would take 6 months. A lag time of 6 months between identification of a pandemic strain and an adequate supply of vaccine could result in devastating morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. A dose-sparing adjuvant that enabled a limited supply of vaccine to protect more people would diminish this problem.  We have identified a small lipophilic molecule that can penetrate the intact stratum corneum and activate the dendritic cells (DC) in normal mouse skin. It enables resident DC to process adjuvant-free antigens injected into the skin and causes the DC to mature and migrate to the draining lymph node where they activate naove T cells. The speed with which this topical adjuvant increases protective antibody responses, its low cost, and physical independence of the vaccine antigen, suggest that it might be an ideal adjuvant for enhancing the protection afforded by a limiting supply of influenza vaccine.  The aims of this Phase II application are to: 1) define the mechanism of action of this adjuvant; 2) determine the efficacy and optimize its use as a topical adjuvant for an influenza vaccine in miniature pigs as a model for human skin; 3) employ assays of transdermal transport across human skin ex vivo to optimize the conditions for its use as a topical adjuvant; and 4) perform pilot pre-clinical toxicity assays on this adjuvant.   If our efforts are successful, the product will be an inexpensive small molecule, applied to the skin over a vaccine injection site that will make vaccines more effective.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The best public health response to pandemic influenza is an effective vaccine, but with current vaccine manufacturing capabilities it could take years to produce enough vaccine to protect the US population. We need vaccine additives that can extend the effective dose of a vaccine to cover more people.  That is the goal of the proposed research.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most important knowledge gaps in HIV/SIV vaccine research relates to the molecular properties of viruses that are responsible for mucosal transmission and the initial virus-host cell interactions that lead to productive viral infection. The present proposal addresses this priority area by taking advantage of our laboratory's recent discovery of a novel strategy for identifying mucosally transmitted HIV-1 and SIV viral genomes (Keele, PNAS 2008; Keele, J Exp Med 2009). This strategy, based on single genome amplification, sequencing and analysis of plasma viral RNA within the context of a model of random virus evolution, identifies those viruses that are actually responsible for transmission and productive infection. This innovation, in turn, makes possible for the first time the molecular cloning and biological analysis of actual transmitted/founder SIV viruses. In this application, we propose to extend this new approach to the SIV-macaque infection model and to test the following hypothesis: Molecular clones of full-length SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 viral genomes corresponding to transmitted/founder viruses can be identified, will be shown to be infectious and replication competent, and will recapitulate pathogenic infection in Indian rhesus macaques. Such clones represent novel molecular reagents with which to decipher the earliest virus-host cell interactions responsible for mucosal SIV transmission and can provide new molecularly-defined virus challenge strains for transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine research. Specific aims of the project are organized into R21 (Aims #1-3) and R33 (Aims #4-5) phases amenable to a go/no-go decision. Aims are: 1) To identify transmitted/founder SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 viruses responsible for establishing productive clinical infection following low-dose mucosal (ir and ivag) inoculation; 2) To molecularly clone full-length transmitted/founder SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 proviral genomes; 3) To biologically characterize molecular clone-derived SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus strains compared with SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus isolates in vitro with respect to replication efficiency, cell tropism, and envelope phenotype; 4) To determine infectivity, replication kinetics, and pathogenicity of cloned SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251 virus strains in Indian rhesus macaques following low-dose mucosal inoculation; 5) To characterize molecular pathways of virus diversification and adaptation between transmission and the establishment of set-point viremia as a prelude to homologous and heterologous vaccine-challenge studies. Results from these studies promise to shed new light on the molecular basis of mucosal transmission by SIVsmE660 and SIVmac251, identify new potential targets for protective vaccine-elicited immune responses, and provide much needed molecular clones of genetically-diverse, mucosally-transmitted SIV strains for transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most important knowledge gaps in HIV/AIDS vaccine research relates to the molecular properties of HIV-1 that are responsible for sexual transmission and the initial virus-host cell interactions that lead to productive viral infection. The present proposal takes advantage of our laboratory's recent discovery of a novel method for identifying transmitted HIV-1 viruses and applies this new technology to the discovery and characterization of transmitted simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV). These results will shed new light on the molecular basis of mucosal transmission by SIV in the rhesus macaque model and promise to aide in the identification of new vaccine targets and strategies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A CTL-based vaccine or vaccine component is considered important for eliciting immunity that contains disease, and perhaps for preventing infection with HIV-1. Thus far, only one CTL-based vaccine has reached advanced human trials, but the results were disappointing. Although it is unclear why the vaccine failed, evidence suggests that immunogenicity was adequate to elicit some protective CTL responses. We hypothesize that the shortcoming was not the delivery system, but rather the sequences being delivered. Antigenic exposure to whole proteins mimics infection with whole virus, which is a naturally failing process. We further hypothesize that misguided early immunodominance against variable epitopes is the central mechanism for natural failure of CTL in HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we propose vaccine sequences that come from highly conserved and highly expressed proteins, to focus initial CTL responses against epitopes with these properties. We also propose that the vaccine be polyvalent to represent the remaining sequence variability in these proteome regions, which is similar intra-clade and inter-clade. Thus the vaccine represents the variability of HIV-1 both across and within clades, dealing with variability to which a person could be exposed, as well as variability that can develop within a person (escape mutation). The vaccine sequences will be delivered using DNA-prime and recombinant Ad5 boost, given that Ad5 appeared immunogenic in the STEP trial and this strategy remains a viable vaccine candidate in humans. We aim 1) to create immune-focusing vaccine constructs that deliver conserved and highly expressed regions of the HIV-1 proteome and represent inter-and intra-clade variability of HIV-1; 2) to confirm the immunogenicity of our vectors in a standard DNA-prime and rAd5-boost vaccination strategy in rhesus macaques; 3) to test the immune-focusing abilities of our vaccine constructs in rhesus macaques using crossover prime-boost vaccination; and 4) to test the immune-focusing abilities of our Env vaccine construct in rhesus macaques using SHIV 89.6P infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for an effective HIV-1 vaccine needs little introduction. While treatment regimens have advanced enormously in efficacy and reduced side effects, lifelong treatment remains an impractical global solution due to expense, long term toxicities, poor healthcare infrastructure in developing countries, and increasing drug resistance. Historically, effective vaccines have been the best approach to dealing with global epidemics.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents an important cause of neurological damage in children and is the leading cause of non-familial hearing loss in the US. Little is understood about the pathogenesis of this infection because suitable models of central nervous system (CNS) infection are lacking. We have developed a murine model of congenital HCMV infection which recapitulates many of the histopathological and neurodevelopmental abnormalities described in congenital HCMV infections, including hearing loss in surviving mice. In contrast to earlier models, newborn mice injected peripherally with murine CMV develop viremia and subsequently, encephalitis. Because newborn mice are neurodevelopmentally and immunologically equivalent to late 2nd trimester human fetuses, this model has also enabled us to study resolution of this virus infection in a developing animal. In this proposal we will study aspects of the CNS infection in these animals including mechanisms of neuroinvasion, the contribution of innate immune responses in clearance of the virus from the CNS, and the interplay between innate immunity and adaptive immune responses in clearance of virus from the CNS. Lastly, the contribution of both innate and adaptive immunity in persistent CNS infection in adult mice infected as newborns will be studied. We anticipate that parameters of the pathogenesis of CMV infection in the developing CNS will be identified from these studies. Furthermore, we believe that these findings can be translated directly into more focused studies in humans that could lead to new approaches for prevention and treatment of this important infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human cytomegalovirus infection in the developing fetus is a major cause of brain disease in infants and children. Currently no vaccines or treatment exist for this infection that is transmitted from the mother to the fetus. This project will utilize a highly related mouse virus and a mouse model of this disease to understand the characteristics of this infection that result in brain infection and the immune responses that limit virus growth and damage to the developing brain.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expanding HIV-1 pandemic, and the failure of human efficacy trials of T-cell and antibody-based vaccines, highlight the major gaps in knowledge that must be filled in order to pursue rational HIV-1 vaccine design and development. One of the most important knowledge gaps relates to the precise nature of early virus-host interactions that lead to virus transmission and productive clinical infection. This application is a new HIVRAD proposal by investigators whose recent scientific discoveries relate directly to this priority area of research. These discoveries - the identification of transmitted/founder HIV-1 and SIV genomes (Keele 2008; Keele 2009; Salazar 2009), the identification of genetically-divergent SIVsmm strains in naturally-infected sooty mangabeys (Apetrei 2005; Apetrei 2007), and the identification of innate mucosal immune responses modulating early virus-host interactions (Estes 2006; Estes 2008; Li 2009) - create a unique and timely opportunity to focus three cutting edge research themes on a high priority HIV/SIV vaccine research problem. The current proposal is comprised of three interrelated projects and two cores led by investigators at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Shaw and Hahn); the University of Pittsburgh (Apetrei and Pandrea); and NCI-Frederick (Estes, Keele and Lifson). Project #1 is  Mucosal transmission and pathogenicity of novel SIVsmm virus strains (Apetrei).  Project #2 is  Identification, cloning and characterization of transmitted/founder SIVsmm (Hahn).  Project #3 is  Molecular analysis of the mucosal SIVsmm transmission bottleneck (Shaw).  Collectively, the projects will test this hypothesis: Identification, molecular cloning, and in vivo analysis of naturally-occurring mucosally-transmitted strains of SIVsmm corresponding to transmitted/founder viruses will reveal viral-host interactions responsible for selective SIV transmission across rectal, vaginal and cervical mucosa and will provide novel, genetically-divergent, pathogenic virus challenge strains for vaccine testing. A key deliverable of this research to the SIV/HIV vaccine field, in addition to new scientific insights into mucosal transmission, will be 18 molecular clones of transmitted/founder viruses representing three widely divergent SIVsmm genetic lineages for use as potential challenge stocks.     RELEVANCE: The expanding HIV-1 pandemic, and the failure of human clinical trials of T-cell and antibody-based vaccines, highlight gaps in scientific knowledge about the initial steps in virus transmission and vaccine approaches to prevent infection. This project will identify and clone new, naturally occurring strains of SIVsmm and will use these to elucidate early infection events in the SIV-rhesus macaque model of human HIV-1 infection.     PROJECT 1:  Title: Mucosal Transmission and Pathogenicity of Novel SIVsmm Virus Strains  Project Leader: Apetrei, C    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an effective AIDS vaccine remains one of the highest priorities in HIV research. Studies of HIV pathogenesis, vaccine design and antiretroviral treatments require an appropriate animal model. However, the existing SIV/macaque model has major limitations since (i) prototypic SIVmac strains are too pathogenic, (ii) do not represent mucosally transmitted viruses, and (iii) have been extensively passaged in vitro and in vivo. We have recently identified a large set of new SIVsmm strains which mirror HIV-1 group M viruses in their genetic diversity. Moreover, preliminary in vivo results show that infection of RMs with these SIVsmm strains more closely reproduces the natural history of HIV-1 in humans. Within this HIVRAD consortium, we thus propose to use these new SIVsmm strains to generate new (molecularly cloned) challenge viruses for AIDS vaccine and pathogenesis studies. Project 1 will use a dose-escalation strategy to infect 21 Indian rhesus macaques (RMs) with genetically diverse SIVsmm strains using intravenous (iv), intrarectal (ir) and intravaginal (ivag) routes. Project 2 will then employ single genome amplification (SGA) techniques to infer, and subsequently clone, transmitted/founder (T/F) virus(es) from all of these animals. Following detailed in vitro characterization, a subset of clones will be selected for in vivo competition (n=18) and pathogenesis (n=8) studies which will be performed by Project 1. Specific Aims include:     1. To generate high titer plasma stocks of genetically divergent SIVsmm strains without in vitro adaptation for subsequent mucosal and intravenous transmission studies.   2. To infect RMs by intravenous, intrarectal and intravaginal routes with physiologically relevant doses of genetically divergent SIVsmm strains to allow for the identification of transmitted founder (T/F) viruses:   3. To identify SIVsmm clones with, preferential mucosal transmissiblity and replication fitness by conducting an in vivo competition experiment.   4. To characterize the selected SIVsmm clones for in vivo replication kinetics, pathogenicity and suitability as vaccine challenge stocks.     We expect these studies to generate new infectious molecular clones of SIVs with biological properties that more faithfully recapitulate the transmission, pathogenic and diversity of HIV-1 in humans.     RELEVANCE: This project will generate new viral stocks and virological reagents critically needed to elucidate the molecular and cellular events that are responsible for HIV/SIV transmission across rectal and vaginal/cervical mucosa and thus eliminate a major roadblock to AIDS vaccine development.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of an effective HIV vaccine is the long-term solution to control HIV/AIDS world-wide. The failure of adenovirus type 5 based HIV-1 vaccines in humans that was designed to elicit primarily antiviral T cells strongly suggests the need to develop novel vaccine approaches that generate high levels of antiviral T cells with improved function as well as protective antibody. Development of novel adjuvants is necessary to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of HIV vaccines. In this HIVRAD, we will use molecules that target mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and CD40 pathways as novel adjuvants to elicit high levels of polyfunctional virus-specific CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells that are resistant to HIV infection and high avidity protective antibody that will lead to enhanced control of HIV infection. This PPG has two projects and two cores. Our project 1 will test the potential of CD40L expressed on the surface of virus-like particles as an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA SIV vaccine. Our project 2 will test the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR) as an adjuvant for DNA/MVA SIV vaccine. In addition, we will test for the effects of rapamycin on other replication defective and replication competent viral vectors. Finally, we will test the synergy between inhibiting mTOR and activating CD40 pathways for enhancing the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA SIV vaccines. The macaque studies that will be conducted in projects 1 and 2 will be supported by a non-human primate core. An administrative core will provide coordination between projects 1 and 2, and core B, and help with data management and data analyses.     RELEVANCE:  WHO estimates that there are currently 32 million humans living with HIV/AIDS. Drugs and improved treatment regimens have successfully prolonged the lives of infected individuals in first world countries. However, these are not affordable for the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals. Even in developed nations these are limited by toxicity, affordability, the need for rigorous adherence to therapy and the emergence of drug resistant viruses. Thus, there is a great need to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine that provides a low-cost, low toxicity solution to long-term control of viral replication - the main goal of this PPG.     PROJECT 1:  Title: CD40L-Adjuvanted Vaccines for HIV/AIDS  Project Leader: AMARA, R    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The failure of Ad5 based HIV-1 vaccine in humans that is designed to elicit primarily antiviral T cells strongly suggests the need to develop novel vaccine approaches that generate high levels of anti-viral T cells with improved function as well as protective Ab. The goal of this project is to adjuvant the cellular and humoral immunity elicited by our DNA/MVA vaccine that has just entered phase II testing in humans in US. Specifically, we propose to target the CD40 pathway on dendritic cells (DC) and B cells using CD40L. Stimulation of CD40 on DC results in production of IFNa and IL-12 that are critical for generation of highly functional antiviral CD8 response. Activation of B cells through CD40 is necessary for germinal center formation where affinity maturation of B cells occurs leading to generation of high avidity Ab. Here, we will express CD40L on the surface of a SIV virus-like particle (CD40L-VLP). These CD40L-VLPs are potent activators of DC and B cells in vitro. In addition, they can be targeted to DC (through interaction between gpl20 on VLP and CD4 on DC) and allow presentation of Env in its native form that is critical for eliciting broadly cross-reactive neutralizing Ab. In specific aim 1, we will test the potential of CD40L-adjuvanted DNA/MVA SIV vaccine to enhance control of a pathogenic SIV challenge. In addition, we will test whether delivering DNA by electroporation enhances the immunogenicity of the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted DN/VMVA vaccines. Recent studies from Dr. Rafi Ahmed's lab (PI of project 2) demonstrated that mTOR regulates memory T cell development and inhibition of this pathway following infection or vaccination using rapamycin enhances the magnitude and functional quality of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Rapamycin has also been shown to down regulate expression of CCR5 on CD4 T cells that results in marked reduction of HIV replication. This could be an added advantage for HIV vaccines, because the vaccine-elicited CCR5' virus-specific CD4 T cells may not be infected by the virus. Essentially we may be reducing the frequency of potential virus target cells while preserving the much-needed CD4 T cell help following infection. In specific aim 2, we will test the synergy between inhibiting mTOR and activating CD40 pathways for adjuvanting the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA vaccines.     RELEVANCE: WHO estimates that there are currently 32 million humans living with HIV/AIDS. Drugs and improved treatment regimens have successfully prolonged the lives of infected individuals in first world countries. However, these are not affordable for the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals. Even in developed nations these are limited by toxicity, affordability, the need for rigorous adherence to therapy and the emergence of drug resistant viruses. Thus, there is a great need to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine that provides a low-cost, low-toxicity solution to long-term control of viral replication - the main goal of this PPG.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The highly-lethal, pansystemic hemorrhagic fever caused by the mosquito-borne yellow fever virus (YFV) was one of the most feared diseases in Africa, Europe and the Americas, until the live-attenuated 17D vaccine was developed in the 1930's. The natural Asibi isolate of YFV was empirically passaged in primary cultured cells to derive the 17D virus. Genomic sequence comparisons revealed 48 nucleotide and 20 amino acid substitutions that occurred coincident with attenuation of 17D. Although 17D is considered a prototypic live- attenuated virus vaccine, elucidation of the molecular basis for its attenuation and immunogenicity has been greatly impeded by the lack of a small animal disease model. Reasoning that virulence of many pathogenic viruses depends upon evasion and/or antagonism of interferon (IFN)-??? responses by species-specific mechanisms, we investigated the role of IFN-??? in protection of mice from visceroptropic YFV infection. We discovered that wild-type Asibi virus and live-attenuated 17D were readily distinguishable on the basis of their morbidity, mortality and pathogenesis in mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1-/-). In this proposal, this model of YFV disease will be exploited to identify and characterize determinants of YFV attenuation and expose molecular mechanisms that control the virus/host interaction. In Aim 1, we will characterize the pathogenesis of wild-type Asibi and attenuated 17D in IFNAR1-/- mice to pinpoint the step(s) at which 17D replication and dissemination is impeded relative to Asibi. Current models of arbovirus pathogenesis indicate that infection of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in the skin is a crucial early event, in which the viruses exploit migratory properties of activated DCs to effect viremic dissemination. Since Asibi and 17D differ greatly in early viremic potential, we propose that differences in macrophage/DC infection may alter pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will use chimeric viruses derived from cDNA clones of Asibi and 17D to systematically identify and map the attenuated phenotype of 17D: i) to structural or non-structural gene regions; ii) to specific genes; and finally iii) to single or combinations of nucleotide/amino acid mutations. An extensive panel of chimeric viruses is already available. These studies will begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of YFV attenuation and virulence, and will provide a framework for  rational  design of live-attenuated vaccines for protection against other flaviviruses.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The highly-lethal viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the mosquito-borne yellow fever virus (YFV) was one of the most feared diseases in Africa, Europe and the Americas until the live-attenuated 17D vaccine was developed in the 1930's. Even today, over 200,000 West Africans contract YF annually, with tens of thousands of fatalities. The attenuated 17D vaccine strain was derived by repeatedly growing a wild-type YFV isolate (strain Asibi) in cultured cells. Although 17D is considered to be one of the most effective live-attenuated virus vaccines ever developed, the molecular mechanisms that control the attenuation of this live-attenuated vaccine remain a mystery. Our long-term goal is to determine how the host is able to control the 17D infection and elucidate which of the mutations accumulated in the virus genome are responsible for the attenuation. To achieve this goal, Drs. Ryman and Barrett have proposed a consortium agreement in which Dr. Barrett's laboratory will provide viruses to Dr. Ryman's laboratory, where their virulence will be assessed using a newly developed model of YFV pathogenesis and disease. Our understanding of host-pathogen interactions has increased sufficiently to allow rational design of live-attenuated virus strains and the technology exists to introduce and test mutations in genetically-engineered vector systems. It is anticipated that our findings will improve the safety and efficacy of the YFV vaccine, and additionally facilitate the rational design of other live-attenuated virus vaccines, particularly against other pathogenic flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile and dengue viruses) and the closely- related alphaviruses (e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus), most of which are agents of both emerging infectious disease and bioterrorism/biowarfare.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a highly cytolytic RNA virus that produces persistent central nervous system (CNS) infection and immune-mediated demyelination in susceptible strains of mice. TMEV infection provides a relevant experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis. In contrast to persistence of non-cytolytic RNA viruses in which the host cell survives, persistence of lytic RNA viruses in which an infected cell dies requires continuous cell- to-cell spread in order to maintain the infection. In this circumstance, the target cell in which the virus persists ideally should be renewable. The infection should not be highly productive; however, virus-specific host immune responses may control a more productive infection anyway. Macrophages are the principal virus reservoir and provide an in vitro model for TMEV persistence in the mouse CNS. TMEV infected macrophages undergo apoptosis and restrict virus production (<10 pfu/cell), in contrast to infection in other rodent cells, including neurons and oligodendrocytes, where necrotic cell death is associated with high virus yields (200-500 pfu/cell). TMEV infection is required to induce apoptosis in murine macrophages since UV- inactivated virus adsorbed to the cell surface to initiate infection does not induce apoptosis. We have shown that TMEV infection induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway that is Bax- mediated and severely restricts infectious virus production in murine macrophages. Our working hypothesis is that TMEV-induced apoptosis is a host cell-specific mechanism providing a means of spreading virus to uninfected macrophages that phagocytose apoptotic remnants containing infectious virus. To understand how TMEV infection triggers apoptosis in murine macrophages and restricts infectious virus production, four specific aims are proposed: 1) finish the identification of upstream signals (apical to the mitochondrion) involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway during TMEV virus infection in M1-D macrophages and determine potential differences in apoptosis in primary macrophages from resistant and susceptible strains of mice; 2) inhibit apoptosis in infected mice to assess the effect on TMEV CNS persistence, virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses and demyelinating disease, and examine the effect in transgenic mice deficient in p53 and Noxa on CNS persistence and demyelinating disease; 3) identify potential virus  triggers  of apoptosis by expressing TMEV nonstructural proteins L and 3CD in mammalian cells, and determine whether TMEV replicons in which the capsid proteins are deleted can induce apoptosis; and 4) investigate the mechanism of loss of infectious virus in murine macrophages that is associated with onset of apoptosis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The notion that multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease is widely accepted as fact. While MS is undoubtedly immune-mediated, an autoimmune mechanism remains unproven. Circumstantial evidence points to a persistent virus infection in MS. Moreover, immune- mediated damage can result from a virus infection in which the host immune response is directed to virus proteins rather than self proteins (autoimmunity). Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) produces a persistent central nervous system infection and immune-mediated demyelination in susceptible strains of mice, providing a relevant experimental animal model for MS. TMEV persistence is needed to drive the demyelinating disease process, but just how this virus that rapidly kills infected cells is able to perpetuate the infection is not known. This proposal addresses a mechanism of TMEV persistence, programmed cell death also termed apoptosis, which decreases virus production (may be required for persistence of virulent virus) and also fosters cell-to-cell virus spread (required for persistence in the presence of host immunity).\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a paramyxovirus that infects essentially all persons by their second birthday. Infants experiencing their first infection are most susceptible to lower airway infection in the form of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, but older adults and immunocompromised patients also experience severe RSV disease. In addition, this virus frequently reinfects healthy, immunocompetent individuals throughout life. Disease in seropositive adults and older children is usually limited to the upper airway, but significant virus shedding has been observed at each reinfection thus maintaining the virus within an immune population. The reason for this relatively ineffective immune response to RSV infection is not well understood, but the poor immunogenicity of this pathogen has so far confounded attempts to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine. Currently there is no treatment for RSV, only transient prophylaxis in the form of a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV F protein. In a new approach to RSV vaccine design we made use of a viral vector derived from an avian paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), chosen because it is known to be a very strong trigger for IFN-¿/¿ production in mammalian species As expected, intranasal instillation of recombinant NDV encoding the RSV F gene (NDV-F) into mice induced 1000 times more IFN-¿/¿ than did an equivalent dose of RSV, and 3 weeks after NDV-F priming mice were protected from live virus challenge. In addition, as we had hoped, NDV-F priming elicited significantly more RSV F protein-specific memory CD8+ T cells than did RSV itself. This result has now been reproduced in two additional rodent species (chinchillas and cotton rats).To test the NDV-F vaccine candidate for safety, efficacy, and establishment of long-lived protection we propose the following aims: 1) Generation of an optimized NDV-F vaccine candidate. 2) Assessment of T and B cell responses to the HRSV F protein following NDV-F priming, protection from live virus challenge, histopathology, and immunological memory in the cotton rat. 3) Assessment of T and B cell responses to the BRSV F protein following NDV-FB priming, protection from live virus challenge, histopathology, and immunological memory in the cow. 4) Large scale production of genetically stable NDV-F under GMP conditions. There is a large body of evidence to suggest that vaccinations placed in the nose may be the most effective means of protection against respiratory viruses. Our laboratory is working to develop an intranasal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, a virus responsible for the majority of nose and lung infections in children. The approach involves using Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which is not harmful to humans, to deliver pieces of RSV for processing by the immune system. This idea has worked very well in mice; one dose of the vaccine protects the animals from being infected later with RSV. In this proposal we will test this vaccine for safety and effectiveness in cotton rats and cattle, the animals who suffer a similar disease with this virus. If it appears safe and effective, we can move this into human trials.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis C virus is a chronic, viral disease that infects the liver. Infection is transmitted by injection drug use or contaminated blood products, and approximately 80% of infected individuals become chronically infected. Chronic HCV infection is associated with an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, HCV is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. Currently, there is no vaccine for HCV and the treatment regimen, pegylated Interferon-?2b and ribavirin, is only effective in ~50% of patients. Due to a lack of small animal model and, until recently, a cell culture adapted virus, little is known about the immune response against HCV infection. HCV Envelope-2 (E2) is expressed on the surface of the virion and is thought to be important in mediating viral attachment and entry. Neutralizing antibodies against the E2 protein are found in infected patients, although the mechanisms by which these antibodies act and the epitopes to which they bind remains poorly understood. An improved understanding of how anti-E2 antibodies neutralize infection and identification of the important neutralizing epitopes would provide a framework for the future development of vaccines and novel therapeutics against HCV. The objective of this proposal is to study the mechanism of antibody neutralization directed against HCV E2 and to identify the antibody binding regions within the protein that are important in controlling infection. To achieve this objective, we propose two specific aims. In the first aim we propose to test the neutralization capabilities of a large panel of anti-E2 antibodies in vitro. We will test the ability of HCV E2 antibodies to interfere with different phases of the viral life cycle, to block infection of viral particles of different densities, and to interact with the complement system to enhance neutralization of infection. This aim will enable us to better understand how antibodies function to limit HCV infection. In our second aim, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanism of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV E2. In this aim we plan to map the critical antibody binding residues within E2 and to test antibodies for their ability to inhibit HCV binding to CD81. This will provide a more thorough understanding of the critical residues within E2 that are necessary for viral entry. Together, these aims will allow us to generate a better understanding of how HCV neutralizing antibodies inhibit infection and whether specific viral epitopes can be used as targets for vaccine development or the generation of novel therapeutics.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C Virus is a blood born pathogen that results in chronic disease in ~80% of infected individuals and is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently there is no vaccine for HCV and the available treatment is only effective in ~50% of patients. We intend to study the mechanism by which antibodies provide protection from HCV infection to better inform vaccine and therapeutic development.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This U19 research grant application responds to the Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center (HC CRC) RFA to establish the Center for the Study of Innate Immunity to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Infection. The Center is comprised of three projects, an Administrative Core, and a Clinical Core, integrated into a Program of study aimed at defining the innate immune mechanisms that control hepatitis C virus infection and the response to antiviral therapy. HCV is a major public health problem, infecting nearly 200 million people worldwide. Most people exposed to HCV go on to develop a chronic infection that often associates with liver disease or liver failure, and can result in death. Infection with HCV is treated with alpha interferon (IFN)- based therapy but only 50% of patients respond to treatment. Thus, there is a great need to understand the basis of HCV persistence and IFN actions in order to improve HCV Infection and treatment outcome. Our studies have defined specific virus and host processes that control the hepatic innate immune response against HCV as major determinants directing the outcome of HCV infection and treatment. The studies in this U19 Program are therefore focused on the common theme of understanding hepatic innate immune programs that control HCV infection, and will investigate the overarching hypothesis that virus and host control of innate hepatic immune defenses define the outcome of HCV infection and IFN therapy. To investigate this hypothesis our Program will include studies to: Project 1) Define the viral and host genetic determinants that confer pathogen recognition of HCV, regulate hepatic innate immune triggering, and that mediate effector and evasion responses during infection; Project 2) Define the HCV/host interactions that drive hepatic IFN production and response between hepatocytes and liver dendritic cells to control HCV infection; Project 3) Determine the role of hepatic microRNA effectors in regulating hepatic innate immunity and the response to IFN therapy in HCV patients. The management for the U19 Program will be conducted though an Administrative Core. The research materials support and clinical data support for this Program will be facilitated through a Clinical Core. Overall, the proposed projects are unique to focus on understanding the virus/host interface that controls hepatic innate immunity to govern the outcome of HCV infection. Results from these studies will provide novel insights to guide the design of improved therapeutic strategies and vaccine approaches aimed at modulating HCV infection.     RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects the liver and causes liver disease and death. There are nearly 200 million people with HCV infection in the world but the molecular mechanisms that support infection are not understood. Our studies have now linked HCV infection with virus and host processes that control innate immunity of the liver. We propose to investigate these processes of innate immunity in order to understand how innate immune programs of the liver can control HCV infection and the outcome of antiviral therapy. Results from these studies will provide novel insights to guide the design of improved therapeutic strategies and vaccine approaches aimed at controlling HCV infection and associated liver disease.     PROJECT 1:  Title: Mechanisms of Pathogen Recognition and Innate Immune Control of Hepatitis C Virus  Project Leader: GALE, M.    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project 1 comprises a component of our Hepatitis C virus Cooperative Research Center (HC CRC) U19 application. The focus of Project 1 is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which HCV is recognized by the host cell as a foreign pathogen to trigger immunity against infection, and to learn how HCV evades these processes to mediate infection outcome among clinical cases of HCV. HCV is a hepatotropic virus that mediates a persistent infection and chronic liver disease in millions of people worldwide. HCV persistence is associated with viral strategies to evade innate immune defenses and a¿ interferon (IFN) immune actions that normally limit Infection. We have identified HCV genome RNA and the cellular RIG-I protein as the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and host pathogen recognition receptor that interact to trigger the expression of RIG-l-responsive genes that serve as immune effectors to control innate immunity and HCV infection. We have found that HCV can disrupt innate immune signaling via the actions of the viral NS3/4A protease, thus providing an evasion strategy that allows HCV to persist. We hypothesize that viral PAMP signaling and gene expression mediated through the RIG-I pathway are critical determinants controlling hepatic immunity and the outcome of HCV infection. Our studies are therefore deigned 1) Define the structure-function relationship of viral PAMP recognition by RIG-I among clinical isolates of HCV, 2) Identify the RIG-l-responsive genes of the liver that regulate HCV infection, and 3) Determine the function of NS3/4A to regulate the RIG-I pathway among clinical cases of HCV infected with different viral genotypes. Our studies are linked with the U19 Clinical Core, and Projects 2 and 3 to feature translational approaches aimed at defining the virus-host interface that controls hepatic innate immunity and HCV infection.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lower socioeconomic status (SES) and rural groups are overrepresented among smokers and suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases. Arkansas has a high proportion of lower SES and rural residents and one of the highest rates of smoking in the nation. Through the Arkansas Department of Health, the state offered a free, statewide, intensive, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two modalities: over the telephone and in person. Extensive clinical, demographic, SES-related, and outcome data were collected on approximately12,000 smokers seeking treatment. Data from this treatment program provide unique opportunities to clinically and demographically describe and compare treatment outcomes as a function of treatment modality, independent of treatment content, and to identify factors that predict success for each modality in this primarily lower SES sample. Factors that predict success in quitting for lower SES groups may differ by modality, as well as from factors that generally predict success for higher SES groups. In the proposed study, we will analyze existing data from this tobacco dependence treatment program, pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Describe and compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of tobacco users who elect telephone versus in-person treatment, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (2) compare treatment utilization and treatment exposure for telephone and in-person modalities, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (3) compare treatment outcomes for telephone and in-person modalities, using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations modeling; and (4) compare treatment outcomes as a function of traditional demographic and clinical predictor variables, as well as other SES-related contextual factors such as support from work and health care providers, using logistic regression modeling. Congruent with the goals and recommendations of the NCI Tobacco Control Research Branch and the Clinical Practice Guideline, this study will (1) describe variations in treatment based on sociocultural factors including novel information (a) on a community-based sample of tobacco users who access treatment and (b) about treatment utilization and outcomes relative to SES-related variables; the study will also (2) generate new information about applying, promoting, and disseminating evidence-based interventions in clinical and public health practice and contribute to tobacco control policy development. This study is especially important and timely given that the current population of smokers in the U.S. comprises largely lower SES groups, that 25% of the U.S. population resides in rural areas, that all 50 states now provide some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quit lines, and that there is a dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded programs relative to treatment utilization and outcomes.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) clearly plays a significant role in tobacco use and the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment, although we do not yet understand how the various factors involved, including education and income levels, exert their influence. In view of the largely lower SES of the current population of smokers in the U.S., the considerable size (25%) of the U.S. rural population, the provision by all 50 states of some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quitlines, and the dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded treatment programs, the proposed study will examine the characteristics of participants in a statewide, six-session, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two different treatment modalities: over the telephone and in person. The information to be gained from the analysis of this treatment program will help understand, address, and eventually eliminate disparities in tobacco use and in the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a protective HIV vaccine would have great impact in stemming the HIV pandemic. Placebo-controlled preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trials and controlled non-human primate (NHP) vaccine challenge trials are important components of vaccine development. This renewal application proposes to continue development of novel statistical methods to address key issues in the design and analysis of such trials. Aim 1 ( Sieve Analysis ) develops statistical methods for evaluating the impact of HIV genotypic and phenotypic variation on the effects of HIV vaccines evaluated in efficacy trials. The methods build on previous work to address three key challenges: (1) ideally the sieve analysis assesses HIV sequences measured on acute-phase samples of breakthrough infected subjects, yet for some subjects only post-acute-phase sequences can be measured; (2) the analysis of longitudinal HIV sequences is needed to discriminate whether an observed difference in sequences (vaccine-vs-placebo) is due to strain-specific blockage of HIV acquisition or to post-acquisition T-cell driven HIV sequence evolution; and (3) achieving high statistical power requires that the measure of genetic distance between a subject's breakthrough sequences and the vaccine-insert sequence be highly immunologically relevant, based on T cell epitopes that a subject can recognize given his/her HLA alleles. Aim 2 ( Immune Correlates ) develops statistical methods for evaluating vaccine-induced immune responses as surrogates of protection within vaccine efficacy trials. The methods build on previous work for evaluating an immunological surrogate endpoint, with new directions to: evaluate and compare surrogate value of multiple immunological biomarkers; improve efficiency by leveraging baseline covariates; improve robustness by weakening assumptions; develop an innovative one-way crossover design; provide assumption-diagnostics and sensitivity analyses; and develop meta-analysis methods for evaluating immunological surrogates over multiple efficacy trials. The methods will be applied to the six HIV vaccine efficacy trials that have been conducted. The meta-analysis methods will also be employed to predict efficacy of influenza A H1N1 vaccines. Aim 3 ( NHP Trials ) develops statistical methods for evaluating vaccine efficacy on SIV acquisition, viral load, and survival endpoints, and for evaluating immunological surrogates for these endpoints within NHP trials. The methods (1) provide exact estimation and testing of vaccine efficacy, leveraging baseline covariates to improve efficiency; (2) address the challenge that viral load trajectories are  truncated by death;  and (3) utilize novel study designs for evaluating surrogate endpoints. This research will be developed in collaboration with international leaders in pre-clinical HIV vaccine evaluation, and will be applied to several large NHP repeated low-dose challenge trials.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a protective HIV vaccine would have great impact in stemming the HIV pandemic. Three research areas central to developing a vaccine are the evaluation of how vaccine efficacy depends on HIV sequence variability, the evaluation of whether and how measurements of vaccine-induced immune responses predict vaccine efficacy, and the evaluation of vaccine efficacy in the non-human primate (NHP) model. For making progress in these areas, this proposal develops novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trials and of NHP challenge trials.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in Argentina with consistently below recommended success rates of 53-66%, between 1998 to 2005, compared to the WHO Stop TB program target to successfully treat 85% of the cases. There are more than 10,000 new TB cases per year in Argentina, 48% are concentrated in the province of Buenos Aires and only 37% received direct observation of treatment (DOT). It is not well understood why DOT is being applied at low rates or how DOT compares to other treatment strategies when controlling for specific patient and health care facility (HCF) factors. Studies investigating treatment success tend to evaluate treatment strategies retrospectively or prospectively with patients divided into treatment groups without controlling for individual or HCF factors that may significantly impact on treatment outcome. Because of the complexity of treatment success in a given population, this study proposes a design that will prospectively assess factors and predictors, which traditionally have been studied in cross-sectional studies. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of treatment regimens (DOT or SAT) and the impact of patient and HCF level factors on treatment outcomes defined as success (cure or completion of treatment) and default in pulmonary TB patients in high burden departments of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Design: Built upon a sequential mix-method (Qualitative/Quantitative) design, we designed a prospective study to follow up a cohort of 1100 patients with first diagnosis of pulmonary TB initiating treatment at select HCF to treatment completion. Methods: The study will be conducted in 40 HCF in Buenos Aires. Patients will be followed from initiation of treatment using TB assessment cards and a survey administered at recruitment. Treatment outcomes will be assessed at the end of the two month intense treatment phase and at treatment completion. Analysis: Data will be analyzed using multilevel regression modeling to estimate 1) the association between treatment strategy and individual patient and HCF level factors with treatment outcomes, 2) the proportion of variability of outcomes attributable to patient and HCF levels and 3) identify modifiable factors that can be applied to interventional studies to optimize resource allocations and impact policy. Significance: Treatment success hinges on a multitude of challenging, dynamic and complex factors, and, although connected, not just on DOT vs. Non-DOT. Identifying barriers to DOT implementation, evaluating risk factors at the individual patient level and system level and the effectiveness of treatment strategies will provide essential information. Results of the present study will provide information necessary to improve the organization of the programs, design feasible and context relevant interventions to achieve treatment success and optimize the effectiveness of TB control strategies in Argentina and in Latin America.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is relevant to public health departments with high tuberculosis (TB) burden, the National Tuberculosis Program of Argentina, the general public and tuberculosis programs in other countries. Understanding barriers to directly observed treatment (DOT) implementation, assessing effectiveness of the treatment strategies and identifying patient and health care facility factors to inform interventional studies are necessary steps to improve treatment success to achieve recommended rates of success.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (the Virginia Tech), and the LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. will team together for this application in response to RFA-AI-09-027, entitled  Partnerships for Biodefense Food- and Water-borne Diseases (R01). We propose to develop a vaccine against noroviruses (NVs), one of the NIAID Category B food- and water-borne priority pathogens, based on our newly discovered subviral particle, the P particle, of NVs. This P particle is spontaneously formed by 24 copies of the protrusion (P) domain of the viral capsid protein, in octahedral symmetry, with an authentic host receptor binding property, highly immunogenic, easily to produce in E. coli and yeast with extremely high yields and simple procedures for purification, and highly stable under a wide range of physic-chemical conditions, making it an excellent subunit vaccine for mucosal immunization. Four projects representing different early-to-middle product development stages will be performed to evaluate the P particle vaccine. In stage 1 we will perform in vitro and mouse immunization studies and compare different vaccination regimens of P particles by different routes with/without an adjuvant for a maximal safety and efficacy. We also will perform similar studies for proof-of-concept of the usefulness of P particle vaccine using the cell culture model of a newly discovered monkey calicivirus, the Tulane virus. In stage 2 we will characterize the antigenic variations of NVs representing different genotypes of NVs for developing a broadly reactive vaccine based on defined antigenic types (serotypes) with a cocktail or consensus vaccine approach. We also will perform genetic and antigenic analysis of the currently dominant GII-4 viruses to address a question about epochal evolution of NVs for future vaccine strategy against NVs. In stage 3 we will further characterize the safety, immunogenicity and broadness of the candidate vaccine in protection against various NVs using the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig challenge model of human NVs developed in our laboratories recently. In the last stage we will develop a fermentation bioreactor for scale up production of P particles for future evaluation of the vaccine by human volunteer challenge studies and clinical trials. NVs are genetically diverse and there is no suitable cell culture for NVs. Our cocktail/consensus vaccine approach and the procedures for evaluation of the vaccine by the surrogate  neutralization  assay and using the newly discovered Tulane virus and the Gn pig model are highly innovative. We are confident that a panel of lead candidates (vaccine strains) will be selected ready for future clinical trials by the conclusion of the studies in this application.     Narrative/Relevance: Noroviruses (NVs) are an important cause of acute gastroenteritis, affecting people of all ages, in both developed and developing countries. The wide spread nature of NVs due to the low infection dose and the high stability and resistance to disinfectants makes NVs an easy agent for bioterrorist attack. In this study we propose to develop a vaccine against NVs based on our newly discovered subviral particle, the P particle, of NVs. This P particle is spontaneously formed by 24 copies of the protrusion (P) domain of the viral capsid protein, with an authentic host receptor binding property, highly immunogenic, ease to produce in E. coli and yeast with extremely high yields and simple procedures for purification. It is highly stable under a wide range of physic-chemical conditions making it an excellent subunit vaccine for mucosal immunization. NVs have been known to cause a brief protective immunity following a natural infection. In this study we will perform mouse immunization studies with different vaccination regimens and immunization routes of the P particle vaccine for the maximal efficacy and safety. NVs are also genetically diverse but our recent data showed that the receptor binding interfaces of NVs are highly conserved due to a convergent evolution selected by the human histo-blood group antigens. We will perform antigenic characterization of NVs representing different genotypes to design a cocktail/consensus vaccine based on defined antigenic types ( serotypes ) using a surrogate neutralization assay (receptor blocking assay). NVs remain difficult to cultivate in vitro. We will take advantage of the cell culture system of our newly discovered rhesus monkey calicivirus, the Tulane virus, and the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human NVs to prove concept and to further evaluate usefulness of the vaccine for future development in clinical trials. This project will be conducted by a research team with multidiscipline experts in molecular virology, immunology, vaccine development at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) and the LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. Our highly innovative approach of the unique P particles and the cocktail/consensus vaccine and the novel procedures for evaluation of the vaccine by the surrogate  neutralization  assay and using the newly discovered Tulane virus and the Gn pig model warrant that we will make a rapid progress leading to the next level of evaluation by the phase I clinical trials toward future commercialization.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several new tolerance induction protocols have brought us closer to achieving allograft survival in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. However, virus infection poses a threat to the allotolerant state because it can disrupt immunoregulation and induce cross-reactive allospecific T cells through a process termed  heterologous immunity.  Studies performed by this Program have defined the temporal relationship of viral infection to the success of tolerance induction and to the durability of healed-in grafts. They have revealed the crucial role of alloreactive CD8+ cell deletion and the ability of viral infection to abort this critical process, and have revealed the key role of heterologous immunity after infection as a generator of primed alloreactive memory cells. The theme of this Program is to understand the reciprocal interaction of transplantation tolerance and virus infection. The Program's goal is to understand the mechanisms behind each of the discoveries that we have made using viruses and TLR agonists as probes into the nature of transplantation tolerance. Project 1 will focus on mechanisms by which infection compromises the induction of transplantation tolerance. Project 2 will focus on mechanisms that compromise the maintenance of transplantation tolerance. Project 3 will carry the studies of Projects 1 and 2 to the molecular level. The specific focus of this project is to define the molecular mechanism of CD8 T cell apoptosis. Project 4 will bridge between murine studies of Projects 1-3 and human transplantation immunology. The project will study common human viruses known to affect human allograft survival using  humanized mice.  Addition of two new investigators to this revised Program now brings innovative siRNA in vivo delivery technology for blockade of CD40-CD154 interaction in both mice and in human immune systems in humanized mice. The Program will be supported by a Virology and Technology Core that will provide viruses, virological and immunological analyses and new technologies to identify and quantify alloreactive T cells and by a Mouse and Transplantation Core that will provide necessary mouse resources, perform and train Program personnel in transplantation, and monitor infected animals and grafts in biocontainment. The goal of these studies is to discover mechanisms that determine graft survival in the face of infection and innate immune activation.     RELEVANCE: This research will investigate mechanisms underlying the induction of transplantation tolerance and graft survival in the absence of immunosuppression and how infection may modulate this process       PROJECT 1:  Title: - Mechanisms of Transplantation Tolerance Induction  Project Leader: GREINER, D    PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms underlying the complex interrelationships of infection and graft survival during induction and maintenance of transplantation tolerance are not well understood. Our goal is to understand how infection blocks the induction of peripheral and central tolerance. We have developed several innovative technologies for identifying virus-immune T cells and determining their anti-viral and cross-reactive alloreactivity at the single cell level. We have also developed methods for 1) quantifying alloreactive T cells using a 'synchimera' model based on CD8+ TCR Tg mice, 2) identifying naive and effector alloreactive T cells by their rapid production of cytokines following alloantigen stimulation, and 3) quantifying in vivo CD8 T cell effector function using an in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We will use these techniques with an exciting new technology for in vivo delivery of siRNA to block of CD40-CD154 interaction. These new technologies will allow us to test our overall hypothesis that induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN1 is a fundamental mechanism by which innate immune activation modulates the induction of peripheral and central tolerance. Specific Aim 1 is to determine mechanisms by which TLR ligation or virus infection modulates the induction of peripheral tolerance. We will test the hypothesis that innate immune activation by TLR agonists or virus infection abrogates the induction of peripheral tolerance through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN1. Specific Aim 2 is to determine mechanisms by which TLR ligation or virus infection modulates establishment of hematopoietic chimerism and central tolerance. We will test the hypothesis that the induction of peripheral and central tolerance involves multiple different but overlapping mechanisms. This project should reveal the mechanism(s) by which infection compromises the induction of peripheral and central transplantation tolerance. This Project will interact closely with Project 2 studying the maintenance of tolerance, and Project 3 studying how alloreactive CD8 T cells die by apoptosis following costimulation blockade. These discoveries will be translated to human immune systems in Project 4 using both the Viral and Technology Core and Animal Core as critical resources for the accomplishment of our research goals.     RELEVANCE: As new drugs for prolonging graft survival in patients are implemented in the clinic, the safety and efficacy of these new drugs in the face of environmental insults such as infections are not known. This work will identify how infection during transplantation may affect the host immune system and ultimate fate of the graft.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to identify underlying causes of Black-White differences in the likelihood of receiving definitive (potentially curative) therapy for prostate cancer (CaP) and treatment decision-making distress and regret. This knowledge is needed to design and implement interventions that will reduce racial gaps in CaP mortality and treatment decision-making distress and regret. Increasing the likelihood that Black men will receive definitive therapy when it is clinically appropriate is a critically important public health challenge. Black men are more than twice as likely to die from CaP as White men, with much of this difference attributable to Black-White differences in the receipt of definitive treatment. Recent evidence indicates that Black men are more likely to experience treatment decision-making difficulty and post-treatment decision regret. Both may stem from a common set of determinants that result in the breakdown of the treatment decision-making process for some Black men. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that racial dynamics in the health care system result in Black men being less likely to receive definitive treatment, and more likely to experience decision-making difficulty, distress, and treatment decision regret. To test the central hypothesis we will execute three Specific Aims: 1) Identify race-related variability in the factors that influence CaP treatment decision-making; 2) assess Black-White differences in CaP treatment decision-making distress, and identify determinants of these differences; and 3) assess Black-White differences in CaP post-treatment decision regret, and identify determinants of these differences. Over the course of three years, approximately 589 non-Hispanic Black (28% of sample) and 1517 non-Hispanic White men diagnosed with clinically localized CaP will be accrued in the study. They will be recruited from four major medical centers. After participants have decided how to treat their cancer, but before they have received treatment, participants will complete a self-administered mail-in paper-and-pencil survey that will inquire into their treatment choice and treatment decision-making process. At their 6-week, 1-year and 2-year post-treatment clinic visits they will also complete questionnaires inquiring into their quality of life and post-treatment decision regret. Little is known about factors that could lead to a breakdown in the CaP treatment decision-making process for Black men. The proposed study will be the first to test whether racial dynamics shown to be common in other health care domains (e.g., Black-White differences in the likelihood of having experienced racial discrimination in health care settings, physician distrust, and racial differences in patient involvement in treatment decision-making, and satisfaction with health care) contribute to Black-White differences in receipt of definitive therapy and treatment decision-making distress and regret.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Not only do Black men suffer higher mortality from prostate cancer than White men, they are less likely to receive curative therapy and they may be more likely to experience treatment decision-making distress and regret. The proposed research will test whether these differences emerge from a pattern of racial dynamics (e.g., past experiences of discrimination, low trust in physicians, and less involvement in treatment-decisions) that have been shown to be widespread among Blacks and to impair medical care. Identifying why Black men are disproportionately less likely to receive clinically appropriate prostate cancer care and experience more decision-making difficulty and regret will provide a necessary understanding for developing and implementing interventions that will ultimately reduce racial differences in prostate cancer mortality and prostate cancer- associated distress.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes painful recurrent lesions in the genital and anal mucosa. Babies born to women shedding virus during delivery can become infected with HSV-2, often with devastating consequences. HSV-2 infects more than one out of six adults in the United States, and is a cofactor in acquisition of HIV. No vaccine to reduce or prevent HSV-mediated venereal infection and disease has yet been adopted. One potential vaccine reduced the HSV-2 infection rate in phase III trials but only in women, and only women who had not been previously exposed to HSV-1 (58% of adults are HSV-1 seropositive). The long-term objective of our research is to develop a universally effective prophylactic vaccine that limits infection and disease due to HSV-2. An effective vaccine against HSV-2 must be safe and highly immunogenic. Cells infected with ICP8- replication-defective virus express numerous viral proteins to stimulate immune responses, but progeny virions do not form and spread within the immunized host, making this a potentially safe and effective form of live virus vaccine. Previous and preliminary studies using ICP8-, replication-defective viruses indicate that 1) deletion of the gene encoding the virion host shutoff (vhs) protein, a viral RNase known to counteract host innate and adaptive immune responses, enhances the immunogenicity and efficacy of replication-defective HSV-1 and HSV-2 vaccines in mice; and 2) B7 costimulation molecules, which send a critical signal for activation of naive T cells, enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of ICP8- HSV-2 when encoded from within the virus genome. We will address the hypothesis that replication-defective HSV-2 can be further modified to optimize its effectiveness by simultaneously mutating vhs and expressing B7 costimulation molecules. In Specific Aim 1, we will generate two new recombinant HSV-2 strains, ICP8-vhs- and ICP8-vhs-B7-2+. We will then compare ICP8- vhs-B7-2+ virus to ICP8-vhs- and ICP8-B7-2+ parental strains specifically to test whether the triple mutant optimizes induction of immune responses and capacity to prophylactically protect mice against HSV-2 genital infection. Another member of the costimulation molecule family, PD-L1, is upregulated during antiviral immune responses but inhibits function of memory and reactivating T cells by signaling through PD- 1. We further hypothesize that a booster immunization with a second vaccine that blocks negative regulatory signals mediated by PD-1/ligand interaction will augment immune responses to protect against genital disease caused by HSV-2. In Specific Aim 2, we will generate a recombinant HSV-2 strain that encodes soluble PD-L1, ICP8-vhs-sPD-L1+. Mice will be vaccinated with ICP8-vhs-B7-2+ virus and boosted with homologous ICP8-vhs-B7-2+ virus or heterologous ICP8-vhs-sPD-L1+ virus. We will determine whether blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interactions increases protective efficacy against HSV-2 genital infection. One or both of these new vaccine prototypes will then be ready for final evaluation prior to advancement to clinical trials.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes painful infections of the genital and anal mucosa and can infect babies during birth. HSV-2 infects one out of six adults in the United States, and has been identified as a cofactor for HIV acquisition. Our goal is to develop vaccine strains that can be used as prophylaxis to reduce disease burden due to primary and recurrent HSV-2 genital infections and to prevent transmission to newborns.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Measles is a highly contagious, human disease that is spread by the respiratory route and remains among the top 10 causes of deaths (197,000 in 2007) due to infectious diseases and the second most common cause of death due to vaccine-preventable disease in children under the age of 5 years. Simple, low-cost, needle-free alternative vaccination strategies may help to significantly reduce the severe global impact of measles in terms of mortality and morbidity. The vast majority of vaccines are delivered by injection, including measles vaccine. Needle-free vaccinations would also help to overcome many of the problems associated with injections, including accidental disease transmission (e.g., hepatitis, and HIV) due to needle-stick injuries or improper/unsafe use of injectables, biohazardous sharps waste disposal, pain at injection site, and need for skilled healthcare workers. In this project we propose to test the hypothesis that sublingual measles vaccine is a viable alternative to the injectable vaccine. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop sublingual measles vaccine formulations with the goals of achieving desired wafer physical properties (e.g., wafer cohesiveness, and target dissolution/disintegration rates), acceptably recovering vaccine potency from the wafer, and understanding the effect of saliva on vaccine virus titer. In Specific Aim 2, measles vaccine dry wafer formulations and liquid measles vaccine droplets will be administered sublingually to cotton rats and compared to subcutaneous injection of the vaccine in terms of their ability to generate an immune response. In Specific Aim 3, a measles vaccine dry wafer formulation will be administered sublingually to measles-naive rhesus macaques. Sera and lavage samples will be analyzed for measles-specific antibody and T cell responses. Lavage samples will also be evaluated for measles RNA. A successful outcome to this project opens up a number of avenues for follow-on research including: 1) conducting a challenge study of the sublingually immunized and negative control macaques one year after vaccination to verify protective immunity; 2) studies with green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled measles vaccine virus administered sublingually to elucidate the sites of infection and replication; 3) extension of this sublingual vaccination approach to mumps and rubella to develop a single trivalent sublingual vaccine; 4) exploration of sublingual vaccination for other infectious diseases such as influenza, human papillomavirus, yellow fever, and anthrax.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Measles is the second most fatal vaccine-preventable disease, with 197,000 deaths globally in 2007 (mostly children under 5 years old). Alternative needle-free, mucosal immunization strategies may help reduce the severe impact of measles in global health, and help to overcome many of the problems associated with needle and syringe injections, which are how most vaccines are administered, including measles vaccine. We propose to develop sublingual measles vaccine formulations and to test these in appropriate animal models (cotton rats and rhesus macaques) for immunogenicity. Sublingual vaccination may be broadly applicable to a number of other infectious diseases, including mumps, rubella, influenza, human papillomavirus, yellow fever, and anthrax.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is 3% and constitutes a major public health burden. The true incidence of acute hepatitis C is unknown, although injecting drug users (IDUs) remain the population at greatest risk in the developed world. Currently, there is no effective HCV vaccine and only 15- 45% will spontaneously clear infection. Treatment in the acute stages of infection has been shown to be highly effective in non-IDU populations; however, few large studies have specifically addressed the question of the optimal treatment regimen in IDUs, many of whom are identified through asymptomatic seroconversion rather than symptomatic acute hepatitis. In the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC) we demonstrated that subjects with recently acquired HCV infection (predominantly IDUs) can be successfully recruited, engaged and followed longitudinally. Overall, 167 individuals were enrolled and followed for up to 36 months. 76% of treatment eligible individuals (111/146) chose to commence treatment, including 37 individuals with HIV co- infection. Treatment success (defined as a sustained virological response, SVR) occurred in 55% of HCV monoinfected individuals, despite a high proportion of IDU (80%). SVR rates in the HIV/HCV group who were treated with combination therapy (peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin) were higher at 74%. Both superinfection and reinfection with HCV were observed with possible impact on treatment response rates. Although demonstrating encouraging results, evaluation of strategies to further enhance treatment response rates are obviously required, particularly among IDUs with recently acquired infection. We propose to 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy versus PEG-IFN monotherapy among individuals with recent HCV infection 2) define the incidence, risk factors and natural history of HCV superinfection during treatment and its impact on virological response and 3) determine the prevalence and complexity of HCV protease and polymerase inhibitor mutations in recently acquired infection. The study will be identified as ATAHC II and will involve a randomized clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of combination versus monotherapy for 24 weeks. The same definition for newly acquired HCV infection will be used as in ATAHC to include individuals with an estimated duration of HCV infection up to 18 months. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals will be included. The primary endpoint of the study will be SVR. Secondary virological and safety secondary endpoints will be evaluated as will the impact of treatment on injection drug use, social stability and mental health. The prevalence of mixed infection at baseline and the incidence of superinfection in those without HCV suppression in the first 12 weeks of therapy will be assessed using both standard bulk sequencing and novel methods designed to detect the presence of low level HCV quasispecies. All individuals will be assessed for the presence of protease and polymerase resistance at screening using a panel of well characterised nucleic acid mutations in the NS3 / 4a and NS5 gene regions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus infection represents a significant global health burden affecting over 3% of the world population. In developed countries the majority of incident cases occur in injection drug users (IDUs), many of who have significant other health and social issues, and in whom uptake of treatment is generally low. Whilst most treatment studies in recently acquired HCV infection have either excluded or enrolled few IDU participants, ATAHC 1 demonstrated the feasibility and successful engagement of IDUs in treatment for acute HCV. Determining the most effective treatment strategies to enhance outcomes in this population is now required to address this important public health burden.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite vaccination, influenza and secondary pneumonias are the fourth leading cause of death in individuals 65 years and older. The recent emergence of the novel 2009-H1N1 influenza, to which vaccines are limited or unavailable, has the potential to cause 30,000-90,000 deaths in people under 65 years of age. These staggering statistics mandate the need to better understand age-related changes in primary immune responses to acute influenza infection. We have recently identified a critical role for natural killer (NK) cells in controlling early influenza infection ex vivo and in vivo. Aged C57BL/6 mice exhibited increased lung virus titers, weight loss, decreased NK cytotoxicity, and a reduced number of NK cells during early influenza infection. Importantly, in vivo NK cell depletion by anti-NK1.1 IgG antibody (PK136) treatment induced marked weight loss and increased lung virus titers after influenza infection of both young and aged mice. These data suggest that NK cells are essential in early control of influenza infection. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that the induction of an effective NK cell response is vital for controlling early influenza infection in vulnerable populations, including the elderly. Our studies will characterize age-related changes in NK cell function, elucidate potential intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for impaired NK cell function, and establish the critical role of NK cells in controlling early infection to influenza virus in vivo. In Aim 1, age-related differences in susceptibility and the role of NK cell function during the first critical four days of infection will be assessed. We will perform influenza dose responses and measure age-related differences lung virus titers, pathology, histology and cellular infiltrates in lung, weight loss, and recovery from infection. Age-related changes in NK subsets, cytolytic function of NK cells, dendritic cell (DCs) function, and local and systemic cytokine production will be measured during infection. In Aim 2, we will elucidate age-related changes in intrinsic and extrinsic mechanism(s) for impaired NK cell function during influenza infection. Age-related differences in lytic efficiency, activation receptor function/signaling, and cytokine receptor/function will be measured in purified NK cells to identify intrinsic NK cell defects. Adoptive transfer studies will delineate between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on NK cell proliferation, apoptosis, and homing as related to susceptibility to influenza. We hypothesize that DCs are critical extrinsic effectors on NK cell function in early infection. Thus, we will measure DC activation of NK cells, DC cytokine production, and the effects of DC ablation on NK cell function. In Aim 3, we will validate the essential role of NK cells in controlling the in vivo response to influenza. In vivo NK cytolysis in young and aged mice will be assessed along with survival, weight loss, and lung virus titers. The specific role of NK cells in controlling susceptibility to influenza will be addressed in mice after NK depletion in vivo with PK136 or in RAG-1-/- or NKD transgenic mice. These three mouse models will afford a clear delineation of the specific contribution of NK cells in controlling the early response to influenza.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of seasonal influenza and the recent emergence of swine 2009-H1N1 mandate the need to study age-related changes in the primary response to influenza infection. Aged mice show decreased NK cell function and elevated lung virus titers during the first four days of infection, and more importantly, die prior the initiation of an adaptive primary response. If applicable to humans, this suggests that the ability of young and aged individuals to mount an early and effective NK cell response to influenza infection is vital, especially when vaccine is limited or unavailable.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimate 6,800 new HIV-1 infections daily dramatically underscores the desperate need for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Despite significant advances in our understanding of both the humoral and cellular immune response in HIV-1 infection, the correlates of protection have still not been defined. The recent failure of the Merck vaccine trial and the unexpected modest success of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial using ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) in a prime boost combination with AIDSVAX B/E, have challenged our notion of what constitutes a protective vaccine. Strikingly, the vaccine induced not only strong antibody responses, but also a robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell response. Approaches to induce HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses have been met with skepticism thus far as these attempts may expand the pool of HIV-1 specific CD4+ T cells targets. However, compelling studies in the lymphochoriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model suggest that virus-specific Interleukin-21 (IL21) secreting CD4+ T cell responses are a critical key factor to establish effective and long-lived virus-specific immunity. Mice lacking IL21 or IL21 receptor (IL21R) were more susceptible to chronic LCMV infection. IL21+CD4+ T cell responses have been shown to enhance cytotoxicity of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and direct antibody class switching and activation of B cells. Thus, IL21+CD4+ T cell responses play a central role in the coordination of virus-specific immunity. Surprisingly little is known about the role of IL21+ CD4+ T cells in human viral infections. Our preliminary data suggest that robust HIV-1- specific IL21+CD4+ T cell responses exist in HIV-1 elite controllers with a preferential targeting of epitopes within the Gag protein. In contrast, in subjects with chronic-progressive HIV-1 infection virtually no IL21+CD4+ T cell responses are detectable. Moreover, we have evidence that IL21 signals can transform non-controlling CD8+ T cell responses into CD8+ T cell responses with strong inhibitory activity. Thus, our preliminary data suggest that IL21+CD4+ T cell responses might be a critical factor for the generation of an effective CD8+ T cell or B cell based vaccine. Specifically we propose to: 1) Determine the presence and specificity of HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T cells as well as their role in the control of viral replication. 2) Determine whether early antiretroviral treatment in primary HIV-1 infection preserves these particular responses. 3.) Assess how HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T responses modulate HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells and enhance their capacity to inhibit viral replication. 4.) Investigate whether therapeutic CD4-targeted vaccination can induce such responses and finally 5.) assess how IL21+CD4+ T cells modulate HIV-1-specific B cell functions. The underlying hypotheses of this proposal are that HIV-1-specific IL21+ CD4+ T cells have a key function in the control of viral replication by modulating HIV-1-specific B cell function and increasing the inhibitory activity of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells. The induction and propagation of these responses in a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine will be essential for long-lived effective virus-specific immunity.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With 33 million HIV-1 infected individuals world-wide an HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed. The recent failure of the Merck vaccine trial and the unexpected modest success of a vaccine consisting of a combination of two vaccine candidates (ALVAC/AIDSVAX;  Thai trial ) drastically demonstrate our poor understanding how to develop an effective vaccine. Strikingly, the used vaccine not only induced antibodies, but also a robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell response. Recent data from the mouse model suggest that virus-specific Interleukin-21 (IL21)-secreting CD4+ T cell responses are critical to support virus-specific CD8+ T cell and B cell immunity. Thus in this proposal we aim to define the role of HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T cell responses in the control of HIV-1 infection to determine whether the induction of these responses should be a key component of a prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NK cells are needed in the body to protect against malignancy and virus infection. Genetic factors in different individuals can affect how NK cells recognize and respond to target cells. However, there is still much to be learned about how genetic differences can actually influence NK cells and their role in virus immunity. This proposal is based on using several new MHC congenic and transgenic mouse strains generated in the PI's laboratory to model the effect(s) of MHC polymorphism on NK cell-mediated virus immunity. The broad long-term objective for the research project seeks to understand how MHC polymorphism imparts its effect on NK-mediated virus immunity, other immune cells and protection from disease in the given hosts. Published and preliminary data implicate multiple mechanisms. A guiding hypothesis for the proposal is that MHC polymorphism can influence membrane-bound inhibitory receptors displayed by NK cells and their capacity to recognize and respond to virus infection. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. To determine the effect of Ly49G2 expression on NK cells needed in MHC-I Dk resistance to MCMV infection. The induction and kinetics of NK cells specifically responding to MCMV infection, and the effect such responses have on DCs and virus specific T cell effector cells will be examined to ascertain the underlying molecular and cellular virus control mechanisms. Aim 2. To determine the effect of inhibitory Ly49G2 receptor expression on NK cells needed in MHC-I Dk resistance to MCMV infection. Preliminary data support a critical role for Ly49G2 in virus resistance. Molecular, cellular and biochemical strategies will be used to examine the receptor and its impact on NK cells. Aim 3. To evaluate the impact of MHC-I Dk on licensing and inhibitory receptor signaling in Ly49G2+ NK cells for highly efficient MCMV resistance, protection of spleen DCs and prompt induction of virus specific CD8+ T cell immunity. Biochemical and genetic strategies will be used to probe inhibitory receptor signaling in normal and inhibitory signaling deficient NK cells, their acquisition of potent antiviral effector activity and their involvement in MHC-I Dk- dependent virus resistance. Relevance The importance and health relevance of the research described in this proposal is related to the establishment of a new mouse model to examine natural killer (NK) cells responding to and controlling virus infection. Achievement of the specific aims in the research proposal will advance our understanding of genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms used by NK cells to provide early protection against virus infection and to help kindle or elicit virus specific adaptive immune responses needed in the eventual clearance of replicating virus. The research project therefore has the potential to unlock new targets of immune cell mediated therapy to heighten disease resistance and greater understanding of the intricate links between innate and adaptive immunity may be important for vaccine development strategies.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research proposal uses several new MHC recombinant congenic and transgenic strains of mice generated in the PI's laboratory to model and investigate how MHC polymorphism can regulate NK cell- mediated virus immunity. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1 will delineate the effect of MHC polymorphism on NK and dendritic cell contributions in virus resistance; Aim 2 will examine the effect of an inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed by NK cells needed in virus resistance; and Aim 3 will study the effect of MHC polymorphism on NK cell education of effector functions which can impact early resistance to virus infection through NK cells and consequently later virus-specific immune responses.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae: lyssavirus) is a highly pathogenic virus capable of infecting all mammalian species. Rabies is a unique virus - almost invariably fatal, yet preventable. Rabies treatment is highly effective if treatment occurs early. Once signs of clinical illness appear, treatment is considerably less effective, and death usually occurs within two weeks. Rabies is one of the oldest known viral diseases in history, emerging approximately 11,000 years ago possibly as a viral disease in bats (Badrain and Tordo, 2001). If this hypothesis is correct, it is likely that virus-host adaptation has occurred between rabies virus and bats over the past 11,000 years. In the United States, large scale rabies outbreaks have been reported in other vector species such as dogs, skunks, raccoons, and foxes. However, to date, rabies outbreaks have not occurred in bat populations. Contrary to widespread misconception, rabies appears to be maintained in low levels within bat populations ranging from 0.2% to 5.5% (Trimarchi and Debbie, 1977). It is likely that multiple factors influence the ability of rabies virus to be maintained in bat populations, including the circulating rabies virus variant, the homologous (host) species, and the host's ecological niche. Unlike many other viral zoonoses, bat rabies virus variants are typically associated with a distinct species of bat, thus we will refer to these variants as homologous rabies virus variants (Hughes et. al., 2005, Smith, 2002). Interspecies spill-over of rabies virus variants have been reported and are referred to as heterologous virus variants infections. Rabies virus over wintering in bats has been suggested as a method of rabies maintenance in hibernating bat populations (Calisher, 2008), and previous studies have demonstrated that other viruses, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus, may overwinter in bats (Calisher, 2008, Sulkin and Allen, 1974). However, the role of hibernation and maintenance of viral infections in bats have not been well studied. The proposed research will address two major questions, 1) Is the maintenance of rabies virus determined by bat species or the rabies virus variant to which the bat is exposed, and 2) What impact does hibernation have on the maintenance of rabies virus? We will focus on three major studies to provide the basis for determining how rabies virus is maintained in wild bat populations: 1) We will compare the clinical illness in bats exposed to a homologous and heterologous rabies virus variant; 2) We will examine the immune response following inoculation with a homologous or heterologous rabies virus variant; and 3) We will elucidate the role that hibernation plays in maintenance of rabies virus. Three species of bats will be included in this proposal: big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), little brown bats (Myotis spp), and silver hair bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Novel aspects of this study include the investigation of homologous and heterologous rabies virus variants in bats as well as the effect of hibernation on rabies virus maintenance in bats. The overall aim of this proposal is to further our understanding of the interaction between rabies virus and its chiropteran host. In this proposal we outline studies to elucidate the role of the immune system and ecological factors that are unique to bats and determine how they relate to the maintenance of rabies in bat populations. The public health significance of rabies is indisputable since clinical infection generally results in death. This set of studies will provide us with a better understanding of how rabies virus is maintained in the most important rabies vector in the U.S. as well as elucidate the importance of spill over events between bat species. This project will lead to a better understanding of rabies virus maintenance in bat populations and its impact on novel hosts. This project is important to public health as bat rabies variants are capable of infecting, adapting, and spreading in heterologous bat species and terrestrial mammal populations. States with terrestrial rabies have a higher incidence of rabies exposure and increased use of anti-rabies therapeutics. Post exposure prophylaxis should be given as soon as possible following contact with a potentially rabid animal. It is expensive, and it is known to cause significant side effects. Completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide data integral to infectious disease modeling and improve our knowledge of the public health risks associated with bat rabies.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Improved strategies and approaches are urgently needed to more effectively prevent and treat recurrent infections in AIDS. Despite extensive knowledge of host immune response to T. gondii infection, no vaccine is yet approved for use in humans for this parasite or any other protozoan parasite causing opportunistic infection in AIDS. Following an acute primary infection, a chronic life-long T. gondii infection is established in CNS/brain and this chronic infection is characterized by the persisting presence of cysts containing slowly replicating bradyzoite parasite forms. Reactivation of active infection due to rupture of brain cysts in chronic infection is the major mechanism causing difficult to treat and life-threatening Toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS. A major gap exists in our understanding of the antigen-specific immune factors that control acute infection and chronic infection. Our preliminary data shows that CD8+ T cells control acute infection and prevent cyst rupture in chronic infection. CD8+ T cells and IFN-3 production are critical mediators of immune control in acute primary and chronic T. gondii infection. We hypothesize that immune control of acute and chronic infection is highly dependent on antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations that recognize specific parasite-derived epitopes presented to MHC class I during infection. This hypothesis will be tested by investigating the functional importance of defined CD8+ T cell epitopes in mediating control of acute and chronic infection in experiments using mutant virulent strains as well as mutant attenuated vaccine strains that lack known endogenous parasite-derived CD8+ T cell epitope(s). The functional importance of defined CD8+ T cell epitopes in eliciting protective immunity to lethal acute infection will be determined, as well as the ability of a normally pre-established vaccine-induced immunity to protect against a virulent mutant strain lacking specific parasite-derived CD8+ T cell epitope(s). This innovative and exploratory study will functionally reveal whether any of the four recently identified and potentially immunodominant parasite-derived CD8+ T cell epitopes and their corresponding CD8+ T cell populations determine the immune control of acute and chronic T. gondii infection. This project offers significant impact as it is relevant to the understanding of immune control of acute and chronic infection, which will allow future studies to focus on the most critical parasite antigens and their antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. This project is also is relevant for the improvement of vaccine design and to identify new interventions to address chronic infection in AIDS.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to understanding immune control of acute and chronic infection in the AIDS opportunistic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. No vaccine is currently available to prevent infection, and no treatment is available to eradicate chronic infection in infected individuals. By addressing fundamental and functional aspects of immune control in T. gondii infection in this project, we expect to reveal new information that can be directly applied to vaccine development to prevent infection, as well as to identify potential interventions to eliminate chronic infection in already infected people who are particularly at risk of serious recurrent infection(s).',\n",

       " 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 180 million people worldwide, causing chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although it is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the U.S, no protective vaccine exists and only a subset of patients respond to the current treatment of interferon (IFN) plus ribavirin. Mathematical modeling of HCV RNA in the serum of infected patients during IFN therapy has increased our understanding of HCV infection dynamics and IFN response kinetics, but the absence of in vitro infection systems has restricted the exploitation of similar approaches to decipher the mechanistic basis of HCV infection and IFN inhibition. Now however, with the development of the first robust cell culture HCV infection system, we can begin characterizing all aspects of the viral lifecycle and the antiviral effects of IFN. Specifically, this breakthrough provides a cross disciplinary opportunity to increase our knowledge of HCV by formulating and testing mathematical models of HCV infection and treatment response at the molecular level. A quantitatively understanding HCV infection and treatment dynamics should help define rate limiting steps of infection thus identifying effective antiviral targets. As such, this application represents a collaborative effort between HCV virologists and viral dynamic modelers to develop and utilize data-driven mathematical concepts to elucidate the biological processes that regulate HCV infection and determine viral response to treatment. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Elucidate the rate limiting processes that regulate HCV infection from initiation to steady state. We propose to quantify kinetic processes throughout HCV infection in vitro and develop mathematical models describing infection dynamics from initiation to steady state in order to identify key rate limiting processes. 2) Validate our understanding of HCV replication and infection by analyzing system dynamics following perturbation of steady state. Mathematical models will be used to simulate the effect of antivirals with different modes of action to predict for each mode of action the kinetics of HCV inhibition. Using inhibitors with known mechanisms of action, we will then perform experiments to test if the models predict the behavior of the systems. The discrepancies found will be used to identify aspects of infection which might not be completely understood and drive further investigation and model refinement. 3) Determine the molecular mechanisms of HCV inhibition by interferon. While modeling itself will enhance our understanding of HCV infection, the models created can then serve as powerful tool for analyzing the mechanism of action of HCV inhibitors. Hence, we will use mathematical models to predict the mechanisms by which interferon inhibits HCV and then empirically test those hypotheses.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To meet the dual threats of emerging infectious diseases and engineered biowarfare/bioterror agents, there is a pressing need for more efficient systems for vaccine development. TRIAD, or the Translational Immunology Research and Accelerated [Vaccine] Development program, based in the Biotechnology Program at the University of Rhode Island, has pioneered the development and application of an integrated  gene to vaccine  in silico, in vitro and in vivo vaccine design program to address this need. TRIAD has selected Category A pathogens F. tularensis, Category B agents Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, and emerging infectious diseases (HCV, H. pylori, tick borne diseases) as the focal point of this proposal. Using the TRIAD immunoinformatics Toolkit, TRIAD investigators will pursue the development of second generation epitope based immunme-derived vaccines for these pathogens, while addressing the failings of prior generations of epitope based vaccines. We will maximize payload quantity using validated immunoinformatics tools that permit selection of optimal T cell epitopes that are highly conserved and immunogenic. We will ensure payload quality by choosing epitopes that demonstrate antigenicity in human PBMC as well as protection in established murine models of disease/infection. We will select a combination of promiscuous Class II epitopes, and Class I supertype epitopes will provide >99% coverage of human populations. We will avoid cross-reactive epitopes and explore the role of regulatory T cells in the context of improving vaccine design. Where appropriate, we will combine our epitope-driven vaccines with broad-spectrum anti-LPS vaccines. We will optimize payload, delivery, formulation, and adjuvanting by exploring a range of delivery options [Dendritic cells, DEC205, DNA, electroporation, mucosal delivery). The TRIAD project aims to develop vaccines demonstrating broad spectrum activity include crossprotective and multiple component vaccines, and delivery technologies that have the potential to be effective against multiple emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Our efforts to merge rational design with recent advances in vaccine delivery will manifest in a coordinated toolkit and a cadre of informed users, who will be ready and able to apply the tools to discover new treatments for emerging infectious disease and biodefense.  RELEVANCE: The Translational Immunology Research and Accelerated [Vaccine] Development (TRIAD) consortium will join forces to accelerate the development of safer, more efficient vaccines for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases. The TRIAD will also support the development of vaccine design methods that significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring medical countermeasures to market.  PROJECT 1: Multi-intracellular Pathogen Epitope-based Vaccine (De Groot, A)  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the context of this proposal, we will use pre-existing defined epitopes for Francisella tularensis (FT), and using the core TRIAD vaccine design toolkit, define new epitopes for Burkholderia pseudomallei (BPM) and Burkholderia mallei (BM), the agents of meloidosis and glanders, respectively, for use in an epitope-based multipathogen prophylactic vaccine. FT has been listed as a Category A biological warfare agent as a result of World War II and Cold War-era biowarfare research. BPM, the etiological agent of meloidosis, is responsible for an estimated 20% of septicemias and approximately 40% of deaths due to bacterial sepsis in tropical regions of the world. BM, a related bacterium, also causes fatal infections (classified as glanders) in man and animals. Like FT, BM is highly infectious as an aerosol. All three pathogens (FT and BPM/BM) are intracellular bacteria and thus amenable to attack by cell-mediated immune response. The EpiMatrix epitope-based vaccine design platform has already yielded a prototype F. tularensis Type A (subsp. tularensis: SCHU S4) vaccine that confers 60% protection against heterologous lethal respiratory challenge with the live vaccine strain (LVS), an attenuated subsp. holarctica derivative. To our knowledge no subunit vaccine for tularemia has achieved a comparable level of protection in this well-developed lethal respiratory challenge model. This milestone was reached over the course of a 24 month funding period. The same vaccine design tools, made available in the context of this U19 program project, will facilitate the development a novel combined vaccine against the three pathogens. We will test the combined vaccine components, and optimize dose, delivery vehicle, and adjuvants, in a live challenge model. In addition to evaluating our epitope-driven vaccine, we will explore whether combining our FT/BPM/BM multi-pathogen vaccine with the anti-LPS vaccine developed by Dr. Steven Opal and colleagues will lead to improved protection against live challenge. The challenge studies will be carried out at NERCE in collaboration with Brown University (Steve Gregory, Steve Opal) investigators. This milestone-driven program will lead to proof-of-principle (evidence for protection against live challenge) and development of a licensable multi-pathogen biodefense vaccine within a five year time frame.  RELEVANCE: Fransicella tularensis, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are included on the list of Category A (FT) and B bioterrorist agents (BPM, BM) due to concern about their potential for weaponizaton. Development and licensure of effective and safe vaccines for these biowarfare threats remains a valid but unmet NIAID and DoD objective.',\n",

Project 2 will analyze the interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses to virus infection and their effects on endothelial cell function, with a focus on the plasma leakage associated with viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by flaviviruses and hantaviruses. Project 3 will analyze heterologous immunity in flavivirus infections, defining the effects of amino acid variations on cross-reactive T-cell responses in sequential flavivirus infections. Project 4 will analyze the mechanisms underlying the selection of immunodominant epitopes from large DMA viruses, including poxviruses and herpesviruses (HHV-6). The Technology Development Project (TOP) will develop novel methods and tools for epitope discovery, characterization of virus-specific T cells, and high-throughput expansion and detection of virus-specific T cells to facilitate broad application of assays of cellular immunity. Core facilities will provide program administration/educational outreach, pilot projects funding, and centralized services for clinical studies (subject recruitment and characterization), flow cytometry, and production of MHC proteins for use by the research projects and TOP. The CTRHIB addresses important NIAID research priorities related to biodefense pathogens as well as career development for junior investigators. Organizing these activities in a single research Center facilitates cross-departmental and cross-disciplinary interactions, which will be assessed by periodic independent review.  RELEVANCE: The UMMS Center for Translational Research in Human Immunology and Biodefense will address key NIAID research priorities through research on human T-cell responses to category A-C viruses (influenza, flaviviruses, hantaviruses, poxviruses, and herpesviruses) and development of new tools for analysis of human virus-specific T cells. The Center provides centralized services and coordination for the research.    PROJECT 1: Human CD8+ and CD4+ T Cells Responses to Influenza Infection and Vaccination (TERAJIMA, M)  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to define the human T-cell responses to influenza infection and to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) in younger and older adults. We hypothesize that (1) human T-cell responses in younger adults will be greater than those in older adults to vaccination and to infection, (2) human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses will be lower to vaccine than to infection and (3) the TlV-induced T-cell responses will correlate with the amount of internal proteins in the individual licensed vaccines. Influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) is a target of protective neutralizing antibodies, which are subtypespecific and vulnerable to antigenic drift. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are thought to be more subtype cross-reactive. It is clear from studies in mouse models of influenza A virus infections that T cells can provide a second important line of defense, especially in the face of marked antigenic drift or shift due to emergence of viruses with changes in HA antibody combining sites, and there are also limited clinical studies which suggest the importance of T cells for protection, especially in a high-risk elderly population. There is, however, only a limited amount of data available on human T-cell responses to influenza infection or vaccination. Importantly there appears to be more subtype cross-reactivity among influenza A virus T cell epitopes than to the antibody epitopes on HA. At present limited data suggest that current TIVs induce low to moderate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. However, we found some individuals with high T-cell responses to TIV. Recently, we and the other group also found the amount of influenza internal proteins in the TIVs differs. Despite the recommendation and use of about 100 million vaccine doses per year in the US alone, very little is known about TIVs induction of T-cell responses and nothing is known about their contribution to vaccine associated protection. In Aim 1 we propose to analyze CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to TIV vaccination in younger and older adults. In these studies, we will also compare the three US-licensed TIVs for their ability to stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and for protection (in older adults). In Aim 2 we propose to characterize CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to natural influenza infections in younger and older adults and compare them to the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses induced by TIV. These analyses may lead to approaches towards improved influenza vaccines, which can protect against new and emerging influenza virus infections including H5N1 and other non-human strains.  RELEVANCE: For efficient protection against influenza A virus infection, influenza vaccines need to induce cellular immune responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, especially in older adults. Despite the recommendation and use of about 100 million vaccine doses per year in the US alone, very little is known about cellular immune responses induced by the vaccines and nothing is known about their contribution to protection, which we propose to study in younger and older adults to help design better influenza vaccines.',\n",
       " 'This subproject is one of many research subprojects utilizing theresources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR. The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.It is very likely that the continuing epidemic spread of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in the US will greatly increase in the fall-winter season when social interactions and climactic conditions become even more conducive to spread of influenza viruses.  While reports to date suggest that healthy individuals typically have a mild illness, underlying medical conditions including immunodeficiency appear to increase risk for severe disease and even death with pandemic H1N1. Thus, knowledge of the safety and immunogenicity of the Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in HIV-infected children and youth is critically important to address the health care needs of this vulnerable population.  Because seasonal influenza has been shown to cause more severe illness in HIV-infected individuals compared to that typical of age-matched uninfected people, it is likely that 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will result in significant morbidity and possibly mortality in HIV infected individuals.  Morbidity may be a direct result of the influenza virus or infection may result in secondary bacterial infections or decreased adherence to the patient s antiretroviral therapy due to the severe nausea and vomiting that may occur with pandemic H1N1 illness.  Prevention of infection in this population will be critical.It is well established that seasonal influenza infection impacts children in a community before becoming widespread in adult populations.  Susceptibility to disease among young populations appears even more pronounced with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) as one third of older adults have measurable levels of serum HAI or neutralizing antibody against the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) while young adults and children completely lack protective titers. The serologic data is consistent with the observation that the attack rate and disease severity for the virus appears to be much higher in younger populations with relative protection of those >50 years of age.Efforts are currently underway to evaluate 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine in healthy children.  However, HIV-1 infected children attend schools and participate in all the activities that typically put children at such high risk for infection with influenza.  Protection of HIV-1 infected children and youth from 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will require knowledge of safety and immunogenicity of these new products in this population.    This study will assess the safety and immune response following each of the two doses of Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in HIV-1 infected children and youth in the US and Puerto Rico.  Two doses are thought to be required because study subjects have had no prior exposure to 2009 Influenza A (H1N1). Because seasonal influenza vaccine often results in blunted response in HIV-1 infected persons, we have opted to investigate the higher dose of antigen, 30mcg, in comparison to the 15mcg dose that is currently being studied in ongoing trials of the Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in healthy children.  We have also opted to stratify our study population into 3 groups based on age.  The groups were selected to provide information across all age groups and with knowledge that there would be insufficient power to compare immune response across age groups.  This study is limited to HIV-1 perinatally infected children and youth.  In order to understand the mechanism of disease and protection, we will investigate the seroresponse, duration of response, and development of influenza-like illness following vaccine in this population.  We also propose investigation of the cell-mediated response to vaccine. The generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) is of particular interest, because this virus replicates better in lung tissue than seasonal influenza and CTLs are the major mediator of viral clearance in the lungs. Memory B cells to 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will ensure that the host responds adequately to exposure to the wild type virus.In summary, 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) is likely to infect a significant proportion of HIV-1 infected children and youth if an effective vaccine is not available before infection is widespread.  Infection will likely lead to severe disease in this vulnerable population, therefore, vaccine efforts are critical.  Immunogenicity of the candidate 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine must be established in HIV-1 infected children in order to assure that this population is protected.  Lack of a protective immune response would support the need for additional measures to protect this high risk population.  The Inactivated Swine-Origin H1N1 Influenza Vaccine is safe and effective as a potential vaccine to prevent or lessen the effects of H1N1 influenza when administered to HIV Perinatally Infected Children and Youth',\n",
       " 'This subproject is one of many research subprojects utilizing theresources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR. The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in an immunocompetent individual infrequently causes clinical signs of infection.  In contrast, CMV infection in those without a functional immune system is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. This includes CMV infections in those co infected with HIV.  Therefore, CMV vaccine strategies developed will have direct clinical relevance to protecting those most at risk for CMV disease, including HIV AIDS patients.Since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first recognized as a threat to the developing fetus, there have been repeated calls for a vaccine that could protect from the damaging effects of HCMV infection in those at risk for HCMV disease. The long quest for a HCMV vaccine that could prevent congenital infection and fetal sequelae, as well as end- organ disease in immune compromised individuals, remains unfulfilled. The primary objective measure for evaluating the efficiency of any vaccine is whether protective levels of immunity are generated and sustained in the vaccinees. An important issue for HCMV is the definition of what constitutes protective immunity. Using a stringent threshold, an immune response can be considered protective only if the vaccinees are absolutely protected from infection following repeated exposure to virus. Alternatively, a vaccine could still be considered protective if the course of challenge virus infection was so dramatically altered that the potential for transmission (horizontal and vertical) and pathogenesis of challenge virus was essentially eliminated. The difference between the two involves the level of virus replication at the primary site of challenge and the extent of dissemination beyond. The former definition requires the generation and maintenance of sterilizing immunity with no spread of the virus. The latter does not, but it does require that the immune system maintain a lifelong restriction on replication of a virus with a complex natural history of persistence in immune competent hosts. The hypothesis is presented that immunization against CMV can generate protective immune responses, although the degree of protection (sterilizing versus limited dissemination) will be dependent on both the titer of challenge virus and the frequency of exposure. According to this hypothesis, immunization can protect completely against infrequent exposure to a low titer CMV challenge. Protection will become more variable as the titer and/or the frequency of exposure to challenge virus increases. Vaccination should shift the virus-host balance decidedly in favor of the host such that both reactivation and shedding are significantly diminished. The hypothesis will be tested in the rhesus macaque model of HCMV infection through the following Aims. (I) Genetic immunization of seronegative macaques with plasmid expression vectors for RhCMV gB, pp65, and IE1, followed by immunization with formalin-inactivated virus. (II) Subcutaneous challenge of vaccinees and controls by experimental inoculation with either high or low titers of RhCMV. (III) Immunization of macaques followed by challenge of vaccinees and controls by natural routes with natural titers of RhCMV by co-housing vaccinees with seropositive, virus-excreting macaques. (IV) Alterations of RhCMV gene expression patterns to induce novel protective immune responses. A CMV vaccine can be considered protective if it results in a dead-end infection. This proposal will stringently test whether a combination of genetic immunization and formalin-inactivated virus can effectively eliminate horizontal spread of RhCMV following either experimental or natural infection.',\n",

The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.Objective: To provide expert support to AIDS research conducted at the Primate Center.1. PROGRESS AND CONCERNS:The Virology Services Unit (VS) performed over 1,700 SIV virus load determinations in FY2009.  This is fewer than in FY2008, as our core users pared back on the scope of their studies.  We anticipate increased demand in FY2010 as established users are funded to perform more and larger experiments.  In anticipation of this increased demand, we tested a new workflow using the high-throughput Roche LightCycler 480 quantitative PCR platform in February 2010.  Transition to this workflow will facilitate an expansion of our services and will simplify batch processing of samples as we now charge all users, both intra- and extramural, for virus load determinations.  Our chargeback system for extramural investigators had 2 users and generated revenues of $18,255.VS also produced over 4,000 vials of high-titer SIVmac239 stock and 3 custom SIV mutants for WNPRC investigators.  In response to investigators interested in evaluating the fitness of multiple mutant strains of SIV, we deployed a  barcode virus  reporter system.  We used site-directed mutagenesis to insert a genetic  barcode  of silent mutations into the region of SIVmac239 gag targeted by our standard QRT-PCR assay.   These mutations do not affect virus fitness, but they abrogate detection using the primers and probes of our standard assay.  This  barcode  virus thus provides a standard against which any viral variant can be directly compared in competing coculture assays.The Tetramer Core of Immunology Services Unit (IS) produced approximately 99,000 tetramer tests in 2009.   25,508 tests were shipped to ten different investigators at nine different institutions, bringing in $76,524 in chargeback income.  We also distributed 7,155 tests to laboratories on campus, including the David H. O'Connor laboratory in Pathology, the Thomas Friedrich laboratory at the Vet School and the Watkins Laboratory in Pathology.  All three of these labs are also part of the WNPRC.  Our FPLC instruments were also utilized by non-primate center investigators, assisting them in preliminary studies, or when their FPLC was not working.  We are currently pursuing MHC class II tetramers, and expect to produce our first tetramers in early 2010.  We have expanded the alleles that are available for tetramer production in 2009, to include several cynomolgus alleles.  We will continue expanding our allele availability in 2010, as more and more cyno and rhesus alleles are found to be important in SIV studies.  In addition, we are developing Elisas for class II tetramers, as well as a diagnostic test for peptide binding.  Our group makes all of the p27 antibody used by our lab, and also shipped 200 tests of this reagent to Stephen Kent's lab in Australia.  For extramural investigators more than 1200 blood samples were processed and shipped out, and 1680 IFN-¿ Elispot tests and 327 intracellular cytokine staining tests were performed. IS also provides expert support to Primate Center, UW-Madison and extramural investigators wishing to use our flow cytometry facilities. More than 2,500 hours were used for flow data acquisition during this year. These activities together resulted in an additional ~$55,000 in chargebacks.In 2009 we purchased a new custom-made BD-LSR II machine to expand our services. We have established or supported the development of several multicolor staining protocols.  These included staining panels to test different functional capabilities of antigen specific T cell populations, and panels that identify innate immune responses after yellow fever vaccination. To promote better data analysis in flow cytometry we have introduced the use of Pestle and Spice data analysis softwares. To expand our services with BL-3 level sorting capabilities Dr Rakasz will be trained to operate a FACSAria high speed cell sorter in February. She will have access to a BL-3 level sorting facility on campus and will perform cell sort for investigators who has this request.2. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCE ACCESS:The central mission of IVS is to provide expert support to AIDS and infectious disease related research conducted at the Primate Center by WNPRC or outside investigators. In fiscal 2009 IS served 9 on-campus and 15 off-campus laboratories, which were funded by both federal and non-federal grants.  VS supported 4 on-campus and 2 off-campus users in FY2009.3. DISSEMINATION:Drs. Friedrich, Wilson and Rakasz, the PIs of VS and IS units, consult closely with users of the service, helping to design experiments and interpret results. We request that projects utilizing Virology and Immunology Services acknowledge the service in manuscripts and presentations.4. TRAINING:Dr. Friedrich consults regularly with recognized leaders in SIV virology and molecular biology to develop and refine our techniques.  For example, custom SIV mutagenesis methods were developed in collaboration with Dr. Ronald Desrosiers at the New England Primate Center.  Quantitative RT-PCR techniques were developed in consultation with Dr. Jeffrey Lifson at the National Cancer Institute. IS staff have been trained in flow cytometry techniques at Beckton Dickinson. Dr Rakasz and Ms Kim Weisgrau, members of the flow cytometry facility regularly train new investigators to acquire their data independently on the flow machines at their disposal.

       " \"Background:  Exposure therapy is one of the best supported, evidence-based treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Accordingly, the Department of Defense (DOD) is actively training hundreds of providers in prolonged exposure therapy (PE) to treat service members with combat-related PTSD despite the absence of any randomized clinical trials of its efficacy with active duty military personnel.  In addition, virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has received preliminary research support.  This treatment may provide a tool for modulating emotional engagement during exposure and present a form of treatment that is less stigmatizing than traditional talk therapies.  However, no studies have compared evidenced-based PE with VRET.Objective/Hypothesis:  The proposed project has three primary objectives.  First, VRET will be compared to PE in the treatment of PTSD in soldiers with combat-related trauma.  By comparing the two treatment options with a waitlist control group (WL), the proposed project has the potential to influence treatment approaches for PTSD.  Second, the proposed project will compare objective rates of psychophysiological arousal during VRET and PE to determine whether increased arousal contributes to better treatment outcomes.  Finally, the relationships between type of treatment and perceptions of stigma, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence will be evaluated.  Soldiers may find VRET's technologies appealing, resulting in increased willingness to participate in treatment.  This willingness to participate should further lead to increased satisfaction with treatment, enhanced treatment adherence, and ultimately decreased perceptions of stigma associated with seeking help.Specific Aims:  This study will test the following five specific aims: (1) Ten sessions of VRET and PE will reduce PTSD symptoms compared to WL assignment.  (2) Ten sessions of VRET will significantly reduced PTSD symptoms compared to PE.  (3) VRET will result in heightened in-session physiological responses after 10 treatment sessions compared to PE.  (4) Soldiers will report reduced fears of treatment stigma following VRET compared to PE.  (5) Soldiers completing 10 sessions of VRET will have higher levels of treatment adherence (lower dropout rates) and ratings of treatment satisfaction than soldiers completing 10 sessions of PE.Study Design:  The proposed study extends to an additional active duty recruitment site (Womack Army Medical Center and Fort Bragg), a previously DOD-funded randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the comparative efficacy of VRET and PE with WL for the treatment of active duty soldiers from WMAC for a total of 240 participants across both grants and two active duty sites.  Participants will be randomly assigned to PE, VRET, or WL.  Qualifying soldiers will be assessed at baseline, after 5 and 10 treatment sessions, and at 12 and 24 weeks post-treatment.  Independent, blind administration of the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) will serve as the primary outcome measure.  Additional measures will assess anxiety, depression, psychophysiological reactions to exposure, treatment stigma, treatment dropout, and treatment satisfaction.Relevance:  The proposed study enhancement will increase the statistical power of the study for detecting differences between the two exposure treatments and improve the study design by extending the research to a second, heavily deploying military post.  This study will provide valuable information about the efficacy of PE and VRET for soldiers with combat-related PTSD.  Results may provide support for the efficacy of PTSD treatment options for soldiers.  If VRET is effective, this innovative treatment option may be an especially attractive option for soldiers who either do not respond to, or are reluctant to engage in, other established therapies such as PE.\",\n",
       " \"Background:  Recent research has shown that up to 30% of military personnel returning from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq report suffering from psychological problems and that only a small percentage of these individuals seek treatment for their difficulties.  Although prior work with military personnel has identified stigma and barriers to care as important factors in treatment seeking, no research has tested a comprehensive model of factors that distinguish soldiers who get needed mental health treatment from those who do not or assessed the effectiveness of interventions designed to specifically target the encouragement of soldiers receiving needed mental health treatment.Objective/Hypothesis:  This proposal examines the reasons soldiers may fail to seek needed mental health treatment (including stigma, barriers to care, beliefs about psychological problems, negative attitudes toward treatment), as well as facilitators of treatment seeking (e.g., positive beliefs of significant others toward treatment, beliefs that treatment will reduce personal distress and improve job performance).  Two qualitative studies will insure a comprehensive taxonomy of factors that influence a soldier's decision to seek mental health treatment, and a longitudinal study will examine the relative weight of different factors as determinants of whether soldiers reporting a psychological problem ultimately seek mental health treatment.  A third study will test the effectiveness of an intervention designed to facilitate soldiers receiving needed mental health treatment.Study Design:  In the first qualitative study, soldiers (N = 30) who made the decision to seek treatment will be interviewed to determine how they made the decision to seek treatment, including how they overcame obstacles such as stigma and barriers to care.  In the second qualitative study, focus groups (N = 24) will be conducted with soldiers of different rank to assess soldier perceptions of why fellow soldiers do not seek mental health treatment and to better understand what soldiers believe goes on in mental health treatment.  Based on the results of the first two studies as well as previous research, a quantitative longitudinal study will be conducted where facilitators and inhibitors of treatment seeking are measured at Time 1 and actual treatment seeking is assessed 6 months later.  The results of all three studies will inform the development of an intervention targeted to increasing the likelihood that soldiers will seek mental health treatment when necessary.  A pilot study will test the efficacy of the intervention (compared to a stress management training control condition) in changing soldiers' attitudes toward mental health treatment and their intention to seek mental health treatment when needed.Relevance.  The studies in the present proposal have direct military relevance.  Soldiers will participate in all three studies, and the major goal of the entire research effort is to provide an intervention that can be implemented Army-wide to encourage soldiers to receive needed mental health treatment.  The receipt of needed mental health treatment will improve productivity, occupational effectiveness, and family relationships.  Also, early intervention will prevent the costs associated with chronic mental health and associated physical health problems.  In other words, such an intervention has the potential to reduce the public health burden of mental illness among the military community.\",\n",

       " 'The Vaccine Branch of CCR has been exploring several novel approaches to an HIV vaccine, including an adenovirus-based vaccine, a DNA vaccine, and mucosal vaccination to induce T cell responses at the site of infection. In addition, scientists in the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) in Baltimore have been exploring a recombinant human full-length single chain (rhFLSC) HIV vaccine that involves epitopes located in and around the co-receptor binding site of HIV-1 envelope protein that are exposed after binding to CD4. These epitopes comprise some of the most conserved and functionally important residues and there is evidence that this vaccine can elicit neutralizing antibodies against diverse primary isolates of HIV.  In FY2009, a collaborative project was initiated within CCR to test several HIV vaccine strategies of Jay Berzofsky, George Pavlakis, Barbara Felber, and Marjorie Robert-Guroff in the Vaccine Branch, CCR in combination with the rhFLCS vaccine of IHV. In particular, macaques will be vaccinated with combinations of rhFLCS vaccine combined with a recombinant adenovirus encoding rhFLCS, a rhFLSC DNA vaccine, or a mucosal HIV vaccine. The macaques would subsequently be challenged with SIVmac251 to assess the utility of these approaches in comparison with appropriate controls. A number of immunologic, virologic, and clinical tests will be done to assess the safety of these vaccine approaches and their ability to yield immunologic responses and provide protection against viral challenge.',\n",
       " \"Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man, where they generally induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types, most frequently HPV 16. Our research is primarily concerned with development of vaccines and other infection inhibition strategies against HPV and the elucidation of the PV life cycle.   We have developed a simple and efficient strategy for generating high titers of infectious papillomavirus particles that transduce encapsidated marker plasmids, referred to hereafter as pseudovirions. This methodology represents a technical breakthrough in papillomavirus research. We have exploited this technology in our basic virologic and translational research efforts.  We have used our pseudovirus technology to develop the first cervicovaginal challenge model for HPVs. We have found that the infection of the female mouse genital tract, even of monolayer endocervical cells, requires exposure the basement membrane to the virus. The capsids bind avidly to the basement membrane but not to the apical surfaces of intact columnar or stratified squamous epithelia. Using a quantitative assay based on whole tissue fluorecence imaging after infection with red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing pseudovirions, we have further determined that nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and Conceptrol, an over the counter spermacide that containing N-9, dramatically potentiate in vivo papillomavirus infection, presumably due to it's ability to permeablize the epithelial layers and thereby expose the basement membrane to the virus. Interesting, no infection was detected if nonoxynol-9 was formulated in carrageenan rather than its normal gelling agent. Carrageenan is an algal polysaccharide widely used in processed food and cosmetics and is the main gelling agent in some over-the-counter lubricants. The results suggest that women using N-9 spermacides may be at increased risk of acquiring genital HPV infection and that this risk might be eliminated by reformulation of N-9 in a carrageenan based gel. Two NCI-sponsored clinical trial of carrageenan as a microbicide to prevent genital HPV infection in young women will soon commence. Our studies in the mouse cervicovaginal challenge model suggested that other interventions that compromise the integrity of the genital epithelium might potentiate HPV infection. Acquisition of ecto- and endocervical cells for cytology (Pap) screening disrupts the epithelium by design. Therefore we sought to determine whether the cytology specimen (Pap smear) collection procedure renders the cervix more susceptible to HPV infection in a rhesus macaque model. In a study submitted for publication, we found that the Pap smear collection procedure greatly potentiated infection by RFP expressing HPV16 pseudovirus. However, use of a carrageenan gel rather than Surgilube as the lubricant used for the internal digital exam after specimen collection largely abrogated the infection enhancing effect. These findings suggest that cytology screening in women might lead to a transient enhancement of susceptibility to HPV infection and that use of a carrageenan-based gel during the examine might mitigate this enhancement. The pseudovirus-based mouse cerviovaginal challenge model is also being used to explore the basic features of papillomavirus infection and the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus in the female reproductive tract. In a study recently published in PNAS, we found that, in a process unique to papillomaviruses, the initial steps in infection occur after initial binding to heperan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the basement membrane, prior cell surface binding. Specifically the virions undergo a conformational change that exposes the N-terminus of the L2 minor capsid protein to cleavage by furin, a cellular protease that we detect in abundance at the sites of infection in vivo. This cleavage in turns leads to exposure of highly conserved L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes that are immediately downstream of the cleavage site.  Blocking HSPG interactions or furin cleavage prevented cerviovaginal infection. In a process that takes several hours, the virions transfer from the basement membrane to the surface of keratinocytes invading the site of trauma, and the virions are then internalized. In a study accepted for publication in Cell Host and Microbes, we determined that antibodies induced by L1 VLP vaccines (of type that are how commercially available) and L2 vaccines (which we developing as a more broadly cross type-neutralizing alternative) block in vivo infection by distinct mechanisms. L1 VLP antibodies block binding to the basement membrane, but allow binding to the keratinocytes. However, the L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes are not exposed and the virions are not internalized. L2 antibodies that broadly cross-neutralize HPV types permit the initial virion binding to the basement membrane HSPG. However, the virions are not detected in the tissue at later time points, suggesting that the L2 antibodies prevent stable transfer to the keratinocytes. These studies may well provide the most detailed mechanistic understanding of how a virus, in a living mammalian host, infects its relevant tissue and how vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in vivo.  Our development of a method to induce efficient HPV pseudovirus infection of the female genital tract after transient disruption with N-9 has proven to be the key to our recent development of an effective intravaginal vaccination strategy. In patent pending studies, we have found that intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination of N-9 treated mice induces strong systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to target antigens transduced by the pseudovirions. Systemic responses rival those induced by previously optimized Ad5 vectors. Intravaginal responses are remarkably strong, with up to 80% of all intravaginal CD8 T cells staining tetramer positive for the targeted antigen. Most of the induced T appear to be intraepithelial and high level of effector memory CD8 T cells are maintained in the vaginal tract 100 days after vaccination.  Intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination is a promising approach for focusing immune responses to the female genital tract and so might increase the effectiveness of vaccines directed against HSV and HIV infections and against HPV induced neoplasia. This concept is now being testing in an SIV/rhesus macaque intravaginal challenge model in collaboration with Dr. Franchini. To more generally evaluate the potential of HPV pseudoviruses as gene transfer vehicles, we have conducted a broad infection tropism survey.  In patent pending studies, we demonstrated that intact murine epithelium at all sites, whether simple, columnar, or squamous, was highly resistant to both virion binding and infection, whereas disrupted epithelium was susceptible. In contrast, virtually all human-derived epithelial cell lines in the NC1-60 panel were highly susceptible to infection in vitro. The remarkable specificity of HPV pseudovirus binding and infection suggests that they may be useful in tumor diagnostic or cytotoxic gene therapy applications. In proof of concept studies, we documented highly specific binding and infection, and dramatic imaging, of human ovarian tumor nodules implanted in nude mouse peritoneum after intraperitoneal injection of RFP-expressing pseudovirus. In a preliminarly study using a mouse model of ovarian metastases, intraperitoneal injection of Herpes TK-expressing HPV psuedovirions followed by ganciclovir treatment, increased survival of tumor bearing mice.\",\n",
       " \"Acute or chronic non-A, B, C, D, E hepatitis is being studied for biological, serological or molecular evidence of transmissible agents. Fulminant non-A to E hepatitis remains a diagnostic enigma and may represent one or more previously unrecognized diseases. We are attempting to discover the etiology of this disease. Evidence for the existence of an additional water-borne hepatitis virus has come from our seroepidemiologic studies in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Hepatitis E virus may be emerging as a greater public health problem than previously thought.  We are studying its epidemiology in developing and industrialized countries worldwide. Serologic evidence of infection of swine with hepatitis E virus (HEV) was obtained. A new and unique HEV strain was recovered from infected swine and characterized.  It was shown to have a worldwide distribution. Seroepidemiological studies of swine handlers and matched blood donors have shown an excess of antibody to HEV in swine handlers, suggesting that the virus may be zoonotically spread. In addition, throughout FY 2009 and 2010, we have been evaluating the significance of antibody to HEV (anti-HEV) in domestic animals that are part of the human food chain, especially cattle, sheep and goats.  Anti-HEV has been found in all of the species, although not to the extent that it is found in swine.  Rarely, swine are an important zoonotic source of hepatitis E, especially in industrialized countries, but these don't account for the high prevalence of anti-HEV in Islamic and Jewish cultures.  In collaboration with XJ Meng, we are determining the susceptibility of goats to infection with the recognized HEV strains and attempting to recover HEV-like agents from young goats that are being intensively monitored for serologic and molecular evidence of infection.  Similar serologic evidence for infection of wild rats with HEV has also been obtained and the infecting agent has been identified. To date we have successfully transmitted the agent from rats trapped in Los Angeles to laboratory rats of the same species (Rattus norvegicus). However, transmission was difficult, suggesting that the virus replicates at low titer. In 2010, using PCR primers developed for detecting a new rat HEV in Germany, we were able to recover sequence from the Los Angeles strain of rat HEV that we had transmitted to other rats previously.  The sequence was very similar to the sequence of rat HEV recovered in Germany.  We have confirmed transmission of rat HEV to other rats and we have determined both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of rat HEV in several clinical samples from infected rats, including feces, serum and liver tissue.  We have documented that both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of the virus is relatively low in these clinical materials, thus providing an explanation for difficulty in consistent transmission.  We have also confirmed by PCR that human strains of HEV were not transmissible to laboratory rats and that the rat HEV was not transmissible to rhesus monkeys, a surrogate of man.  The low virus titers detected in rats, the difficulty in transmitting the virus to rats and the inability to transmit the rat virus to a nonhuman primate species that is susceptible to infection by human and swine HEV strains leads us to conclude that the rat virus probably does not pose a threat of zoonotic infection to humans.Modern techniques of molecular biology have been used to discover new viruses in recent years. These are now being applied to sera from patients with transfusion-associated or community-acquired hepatitis in a search for new hepatitis viruses that may cause up to 2% of such hepatitis in the US and up to one-third of hepatitis in developing countries. In addition, a significant number of cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer remain undiagnosed.  In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of virus discovery, we are applying microarray technology to attempts to transmit new agents to chimpanzees, the only species other than man that is susceptible to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses. Preliminary results are promising. Similarly, approximately one half of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases have no recognized etiology.  In collaboration with the Epidemiology Section, LID, we are applying the same approaches to attempts to identify new gastroenteritis agents. In FY 2009, while evaluating the innate and adaptive immune responses of chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV), we discovered an aberrant innate immune response in two chimpanzees that had been infected with HEV from an outbreak of hepatitis E in Pakistan.  Based on extensive experience with innate and adaptive immune responses to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses in chimpanzees, we postulated that the response in these animals was to a second agent replicating in the liver.  By attempting transmission from the second innate immune response episode to new chimpanzees, we demonstrated evidence for an infection not related to hepatitis E in the original infection.  It has been associated with only minor biochemical evidence of hepatitis, but that is also true for HEV infection of chimpanzees.  We plan to determine if this putative agent produces more severe infection on serial passage and whether it can be associated with hepatitis or other liver disease, such as liver cancer.  Liver cancer is a common sequela of infection with three of the five recognized human hepatitis viruses.In 2010, we attempted to identify an etiologic agent in clinical materials from one of the chimpanzees with evidence of infection with a possible new hepatitis agent.  Clinical samples were tested on the  virus Chip  being utilized at the time under the NCI contract with SAIC.  Although, based on sequences detected, several viruses were found to be infecting the chimpanzee, none was found to be unique to the acute phase sample but not the pre-infection sample.  Subsequently, both pre-infection and acute phase plasma samples from the chimpanzee were subjected to  next-generation  deep sequencing with  454 technology.  Both sequences of known virus families (in some cases the same as those detected by the virus Chip) and unique sequences were detected.  These are currently being subjected to in-depth analysis to determine if they include one or more previously unrecognized viruses.\",\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype, including H5N1 viruses that have caused human infections since 2003. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, clinical lots of vaccines were generated and Phase I clinical trials of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccines for healthy adults were undertaken under an IND. Several factors contribute to the possibility of an H2 influenza pandemic. First, H2 viruses have proven capable of causing disease in humans. Of the sixteen HA and nine NA subtypes, only H1, H2 and H3 viruses have been known to lead to human influenza pandemics since influenza viruses were first isolated in 1933. While H1N1 and H3N2 viruses have been co-circulating for the past 30 years, H2N2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968. Thus, there is declining pre-existing immunity to H2 influenza viruses in the population today. Although H2 influenza has not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. The cold adapted (ca) influenza A/AA/6/60 (AA) (H2N2) virus is the backbone for the live attenuated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine licensed in the United States. In addition to evaluating the AA ca virus as an H2 subtype vaccine, we selected a group of geographically and temporally diverse wild-type H2 influenza viruses and evaluated the kinetics of replication and compared the ability of these viruses to induce a broadly cross-reactive antibody response in mice and ferrets. In both mice and ferrets, A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2), A/mallard/NY/1978 (H2N2) and A/swine/MO/2006 (H2N3) elicited the broadest cross-reactive antibody responses against heterologous H2 influenza viruses as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays. These data suggested that these 3 viruses may be suitable candidates for development as live attenuated H2 pandemic influenza vaccines.In collaboration with scientists at Yale University, we had previously generated an efficacious vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based AIV vaccine expressing H5 hemagglutinin (HA) from the fifth genomic position of VSV. We characterized VSV-based vaccines that express the HK/156 (clade 0) H5 HA from the first position of the VSV genome. These vectors induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses of different clades in mice. The vaccines provided complete protection against morbidity and mortality after heterologous challenge with clade 0 and clade 1 H5N1 strains in animals even 1 year after vaccination. Post-challenge pulmonary virus loads showed that these vectors provide sterilizing immunity. Therefore, VSV-based AIV vaccines are potent, broadly cross-protective pandemic vaccine candidates.Intramuscular administration of inactivated influenza vaccine is the main vaccine platform used for the prevention of seasonal influenza infection.  In clinical trials, inactivated H5N1 vaccines have been shown to be safe and capable of eliciting immune correlates of protection. However, the H5N1 vaccines are poorly immunogenic compared to seasonal influenza vaccines.  Needle-free vaccination would be more efficient and economical in a pandemic and developing an effective and safe mucosal adjuvant will be an important milestone.  A stabilized chemical analog of double-stranded ribonucleic acid, PIKA is a potent mucosal adjuvant in a murine model.  While PIKA stimulates dendritic cells in vitro, little was known about its receptor and adjuvanting mechanism in vivo.  In collaboration with scientists in Singapore, we demonstrated that the immuno-stimulatory effect of PIKA resulted in an increased number of mature antigen-presenting cells, with the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the inoculation site.  In addition, co-administration of PIKA with a poorly immunogenic subunit H5N1 vaccine led to antigen sparing and quantitative and qualitative improvement of the immune responses over those achieved with an unadjuvanted vaccine in mice.  The adjuvanted vaccine provided protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 wildtype viruses.  Mice lacking functional TLR3 showed diminished cytokine production with PIKA stimulation, diminished antibody responses and reduced protective efficacy against wildtype virus challenge following vaccination.  These data suggest that TLR3 is important for optimal performance of PIKA as an adjuvant.  With its good safety profile and antigen-sparing effect, PIKA could be an attractive adjuvant for use in future pandemics.The efficacy of PIKA as prophylaxis against infection with 5 different influenza A virus subtypes was also evaluated in mice.  Intranasal treatment with PIKA resulted in significant reduction of viral replication in the respiratory tract.  The inhibitory effect was mediated by rapid infiltration of immune cells into the lungs, and production of inflammatory cytokines. While TLR3 is important for the optimal production of these inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of viral replication was still observed in TLR3-/- mice.  In addition, a significant synergistic effect in inhibiting H5N1 virus replication was observed when PIKA was co-administered with oseltamivir.  The broad-spectrum protection provided by PIKA makes it an attractive option for prophylaxis from infection with influenza A viruses.The influenza virus is constantly changing; immunity to one seasons strains does not translate into immunity in subsequent years. As a consequence, the vaccine is reformulated each year. The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. Heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple subtypes have been recently isolated from phage libraries, but it was not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of the immune response. In collaboration with scientists at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Switzerland, we found that following seasonal influenza vaccination, some individuals produced antibodies that cross-reacted with H5 hemagglutinin (HA). By immortalizing IgG+ B cells from four individuals we isolated a panel of 20 heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9), including the recent pandemic H1N1 A/California/07/09 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high load of somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that mapped to the HA globular head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce a polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibody response that cross-reacts with the swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.',\n",
       " 'We reported previously the first randomized study of any kind in patients with nonmetastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study employed vaccine, the hormone nilutamide, and the combined therapy (crossover for each arm) with an endpoint of time to progression. We now report survival analyses at 6.5 years from the initiation of therapy with a median potential follow-up of 4.4 years. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive either a poxvirus-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine or nilutamide. Patients in either arm who developed increasing PSA without radiographic evidence of metastasis could cross over to receive the combined therapies. Median survival among all patients was 4.4 years from date of enrollment. Median survival exhibited a trend toward improvement for patients initially randomized to the vaccine arm (median, 5.1 versus 3.4 years; P = 0.13). Starting from the on-study date, the retrospectively determined subset of 12 patients who initially received vaccine and then later received nilutamide suggested improved survival compared with the 8 patients who began with nilutamide and subsequently were treated with vaccine (median, 6.2 versus 3.7 years; P = 0.045). A subgroup analysis of patients randomized to the vaccine arm versus the nilutamide arm showed substantial improvements in survival if at baseline patients had a Gleason score less than 7 (P = 0.033) and PSA less than 20 ng/dL (P = 0.013) or who had prior radiation therapy (P = 0.018). These data indicate that patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (D0.5) who receive vaccine before second-line hormone therapy may potentially result in improved survival compared with patients who received hormone therapy and then vaccine. These data also suggest that patients with more indolent disease may derive greater clinical benefit from vaccine alone or vaccine before second-line hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy followed by vaccine. These findings have potential implications for both the design and endpoint analysis of larger vaccine combination therapy trials. We hypothesized that a metronomic dose of IL-2 as a biological adjuvant would cause less toxicity while maintaining immunologic response. Eighteen patients with localized prostate cancer were treated in a single arm trial using previously established doses of vaccine and radiation therapy. The vaccine used was a recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to encode PSA admixed with a recombinant vaccinia encoding the costimulatory molecule B7.1, followed by booster vaccinations with a recombinant fowlpox vector expressing PSA. Patients received a total of eight planned vaccination cycles, once every 4 weeks, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor given on days 1to 4 and IL-2 at a dose of 0.6MIU/M2 given from days 8 to 21 after each vaccination. Definitive external beam radiation therapy was initiated after the third vaccination cycle. Patients were evaluated for safety and immunologic response. Toxicity and immunologic activity were compared with the previously reported regimen containing a higher dose of IL-2. Seventeen of 18 patients received all eight cycles of vaccine with IL-2. Five of eight HLA-A2+ patients evaluated had an increase in PSA-specific T cells of greater than or equal to 3-fold. Toxicities were generally mild, with only seven vaccination cycles of 140 given resulting in grade 3 toxicities possibly attributable to IL-2. Metronomic-dose IL-2 in combination with vaccine and radiation therapy is safe, can induce prostate-specific immune responses, and has immunologic activity similar to low-dose IL-2, with markedly reduced toxicities. Dr. Gulley and his colleagues in the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) and the Medical Oncology Branch (MOB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), NCI, have ongoing or recently completed in FY08-09 the following collaborative vaccine clinical trials at the NCI Clinical Center.

       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths in the US annually.Role of sialic acid binding specificity of IAV Hemagglutinin (HA) in virulence and pathogenesis: IAV HA is responsible for binding sialic acid containing glycoproteins on cells to initiate infection. The specificity of HA binding to terminal sialic acid (SA) residues is dependent on the conformation of the bond to the penultimate carbohydrate. In general, avian-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,3 Gal and human-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,6 Gal. To understand how changing HA binding specificity affects IAV virulence in a mouse model, we studied the growth, virulence and pathogenicity of a number of recombinant influenza viruses expressing wild-type and mutant avian and human HA genes created using reverse genetics on the backbone of a contemporary low passage human H1N1 virus. These studies revealed that the 1918 IAV HA sequence likely contains virulence motifs outside of the receptor-binding domain. In work this year, we are characterizing the sialic acid distribution by lectin histochemistry on respiratory tissues of various animal models of influenza, and developing methods to examine influenza virus binding to fixed tissue sections.The virulence of the 1918 influenza virus is still incompletely understood. To further evaluate the virulence encoded by the 1918 HA, we constructed a series of chimeric influenza viruses that contained the HA segment of the 1918, 1957, 1968 or 2009 pandemic influenza viruses in the context of 7 identical genomic segments derived from a seasonal H1N1 influenza strain.  We analyzed the role of the influenza viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein in pathogenesis and cell tropism in a mouse model.  We also explored whether there was an association between the binding activity of HA proteins to lung surface surfactant protein D (SP-D), and their ability to infect bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract. Pandemic HA-expressing viruses were evaluated for disease severity and pathology, viral replication, inflammatory responses, and SP-D binding compared to viruses containing recent seasonal HA segments in BALB/c mice.  We found that viruses expressing the HA gene of all pandemic viruses were associated with significant lower respiratory tract pathology, and acute inflammation and showed low binding activity for SP-D.  In contrast, viruses expressing the HA of seasonal influenza strains resulted in mild disease with little lung pathology in infected mice and exhibited strong in vitro binding to SP-D.  Low SP-D binding activity is thus a shared feature of the HA proteins of the past four pandemic influenza viruses and may be an important feature of future pandemic influenza viruses ability to cause severe disease. The role of the ribonucleoprotein complex in host adaptation and pathogenesis of IAV: The proteins that make up the IAV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex - PB2, PB1, PA, and NP are likely to play a significant role in pathogenesis of IAV infection since a virus that can replicate to a high titer may be more pathogenic, and mutations in these genes are also very likely to be crucial for host switch events in IAV since replication must occur in the context of the host cellular milieu. Because IAVs are known to acquire host-adaptive genome mutations, and since the PB2 gene of the 2009 H1N1 virus is of recent avian derivation, there exists concern that the pathogenicity of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic virus could be potentiated by acquisition of the host-adaptive PB2-E627K or -D701N mutations, which have been shown to enhance the virulence of other influenza viruses. We evaluated influenza viral infections in a mouse model which showed that these mutations did not increase the virulence of viruses containing the 2009 H1N1 viral polymerase. This further supports the importance of historical contingency in the development and evolution of novel influenza viruses.Epidemic or seasonal influenza is also a significant cause of illness and death. This year we characterized a novel in-frame deletion occurring in the neuraminidase gene of a recent H3N2 virus isolated from a patient on oseltamivir antiviral therapy. The virus was not attenuated in its growth in vitro or in vivo, and was efficiently transmitted in a ferret model system.',\n",
       " 'Thymic-derived T regulatory cells (Treg) express the lineage commitment transcription factor Foxp3 and play critical roles in all aspects of immune responses including control of the interaction of the host with microbes. The mechanisms by which Tregs modulate responses to infectious agents are complex and include limiting exuberant inflammatory responses with control of tissue damage, facilitation of the persistence of the pathogen for maintenance of immunity, but also enhanced pathogen replication and suppression of effector T cell function. Progress in this area has been limited because of our lack of knowledge regarding the nature of the antigens recognized by Tregs. The mouse model of infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  (LCMV) allows one to differentiate between the effects of acute and chronic viral infection on Treg activation. Our initial approach to exploring the role of Treg during LCMV infection was to compare the frequency and phenotype of Treg in C57BL/6 mice during the course of Armstrong and Clone 13 LCMV infection. Treg dramatically increased in frequency among splenic CD4+CD8- T cells during Clone 13, but not Armstrong, infection. This increase in the frequency of Foxp3+ Treg was transient and peaked at 17 days post infection (dpi). Treg from Clone 13 infected mice displayed a much more activated phenotype. A marked increase in the frequency of Foxp3+ Treg expressing TCR Vbeta5 was observed, again specifically during Clone 13 infection. There was no change in the percentage of Treg expressing any of the other Vbeta analyzed and no change in the frequency of CD4+Vbeta5+Foxp3- cells was noted during either Armstrong or Clone 13 infections. The failure to observe Treg expansion during Armstrong infection was secondary to the absence of viral chronicity and not to the minor sequence difference between the two strains. Studies in other infectious disease models suggest that Tregs in infected animals may be specific for the infectious organism or perhaps specific for ubiquitous or tissue-specific antigens whose expression is enhanced during the course of the infection. We saw no evidence for Treg cell specific reactivity in response to a library of overlapping peptides that span the entire LCMV proteome. Because the expansion of the Treg in mice chronically infected with LCMV was restricted to a specific Vbeta segment, we also considered the possibility that a superantigen (Sag) may be driving proliferation. As LCMV has not been previously shown to express a superantigen, a likely explanation for our results was that the expansion of the Vbeta5+ Treg was secondary to stimulation by an endogenous Sag such as mouse mammary tumor virus-(Mtv) encoded Sags. To examine this possibility, we infected BALB/c, that normally express Mtv-6, -8, and -9 and delete Vbeta-5, -11, and -12 T cells in the thymus, with Clone 13 and analyzed the effects of infection on the Vbeta repertoire. We observed a significant increase in the percentage of CD4+Foxp3+Vbeta5+ and a dramatic increase in Foxp3+Vbeta12+ Treg, but no change in the percentage of CD4+Foxp3-Vbeta5+ or Foxp3-Vbeta12+ T cells, following Clone 13 infection. To directly prove that expansion of the Vbeta5 and Vbeta12 Foxp3+ subsets in BALB/c mice was secondary to activation by endogenous Mtv-Sag, we infected BALB/c mice lacking all three of the endogenous Mtv proviruses (Mtv-null mice). Consistent with a lack of Mtv-Sag, these mice had a substantial population of T cells that expressed either Vbeta5 or Vbeta12 in Foxp3+ and Foxp3- subsets.  However, we observed no change in the frequencies of either Vbeta5+ or Vbeta12+ Treg in these mice following infection, thus demonstrating that the observed Vbeta-specific Treg expansion was, in fact, due to stimulation by an endogenous retroviral superantigen.    We have focused on determining the mechanism by which chronic infection results in Mtv Sag-dependent Treg expansion. In particular, we have sought to identify the antigen presenting cell (APC) responsible for Sag-dependent Treg expansion. First, we asked whether LCMV infection resulted in increased expression of the endogenous Sag genes. Because Mtv8 and Mtv9 Sag appeared to be responsible for the Vbeta-specific Treg expansion, we determined the relative expression of these genes in splenic MHC class II-enriched cells from BALB/c mice by quantitative real time-PCR. At 8 days post infection, Mtv8 and/or Mtv9 Sag expression was up regulated 2- and 25-fold in Armstrong and clone 13 infected mice, respectively, compared to uninfected controls. To further define the type of APC responsible for Treg expansion, we examined the role of B cells and dendritic cells (cell types that have been shown to be the primary APC that express several endogenous Mtvs in the periphery) using genetically deficient mice. Infection of B cell deficient mice (&#956;MT) resulted in normal expansion similar to wild-type mice. However, Flt3L-/- mice (which are defective in several hematopoietic cell lineages, but primarily dendritic cells) infected with clone 13 displayed only a modest increase in frequency of Vbeta-specific Treg, suggesting that Sag presentation by dendritic cells was primarily responsible for the Treg expansion observed following infection.  Because dendritic cells have the potential to produce a plethora of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we further hypothesized that mice unable to make individual pro-inflammatory cytokines may display a defect in Treg expansion following infection. To test this, we infected IL-1Ralpha-/-, IL-6-/-, IL-12 (p35)-/-, TNFalpha-/-, or IFNalpha-betaR-/- mice with clone 13 and analyzed the effect on Vbeta-specific Treg expansion. Only IFNalpa-betaR-/- mice infected with clone 13 showed a lack of Vbeta-specific Treg expansion following infection. Stimulation of dendritic cells through toll-like receptors (TLR) is a primary mechanism by which Type-I IFNs are produced. This mechanism also appeared to be important in LCMV-mediated Treg expansion as infection of MyD88-/- mice with clone 13 resulted in a similar lack of expansion of Vbeta5-specific Treg, suggesting that MyD88-dependent Type-I IFN production is required for Mtv Sag-dependent Treg expansion following clone 13 infection.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to preventive HIV vaccines conducted at the VRC Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center. These consist of a screening protocol and clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines including: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. A brief summary of each study to date follows.The screening protocol, VRC 000 (02-I-0127), facilitates recruitment and screening of healthy, HIV-negative subjects for investigational preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials. Educational materials on vaccines are reviewed with and provided to subjects before enrollment into a study.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5): p. 601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published Vaccine, 2007. 25(20): p. 4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) is a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed.   VRC 009 (05-I-0081) is a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) is a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLOS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p. 1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) is a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed.  The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in teh past year.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in the past year.HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase II study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed to begin a new phase of evaluation. It is designed to see whether or not the vaccines have an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who later acquire HIV infection during about 3 years of follow-up.',\n",
       " 'The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus and comprise some of the most medically significant emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. TBFV include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Powassan virus and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. Other flaviviruses include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Hence, research into the pathogenesis of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of this globally important group of viruses.  The research in our laboratory aims to identify and understand interactions between the TBFV and their hosts (both the arthropod and the mammal) critical to virus replication and pathogenesis. We study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV.  Studies using LGTV will form the basis for work on the more virulent BSL-4 TBEV. 1.  Analysis of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. Ixodid ticks represent the natural reservoir of TBFV, are critical for virus persistence in nature, and are the major vector for infection of humans. We have developed a custom Agilent microarray to investigate salivary gland transcriptional changes in Ixodes scapularis nymphs during feeding or after infection with LGTV. The first aim of this work is to identify tick proteins important during feeding.  The second aim of this work is to identify tick proteins important for the replication or transmission of TBFV.  Such genes may be targets for the development of novel vaccines or other technologies that have the potential to disrupt tick feeding and/or flavivirus transmission. Comparison of fed and unfed ticks revealed a dramatic metabolic change reflected by up-regulation of 578 transcripts during feeding. Of the 578 up-regulated genes, 128 are predicted to code for secreted proteins. These putative secreted proteins are interesting targets to pursue because they are likely present in the saliva and may facilitate feeding or evasion the host response.  Interestingly, 135 of the 578 transcripts are classified as having no known function based on homology searches.  These uncharacterized transcripts may have novel functions during feeding and are also interesting targets for further analysis. A clear temporal pattern of gene expression changes was observed showing clusters of genes were specifically up-regulated at 1, 2 or 3 days of feeding. Among the three days of feeding that were compared, the third day was the most unique.  This may reflect the peak of metabolic activation in the tick when more salivary products are required to disarm the host response. The array data was validated using real-time PCR. Comparison of LGTV-infected and uninfected ticks has identified small, but significant gene expression changes associated with LGTV infection. We are currently validating the results of this microarray.  One transcript that was significantly up-regulated in LGTV-infected ticks has homology to the lipocalin gene family.  The putative histamine and serotonin-binding capability of lipocalins suggests they play a role in evasion of the host inflammatory and hemostatic responses, respectively.  Thus, increased levels of lipocalin proteins may confer a survival advantage to the virus at the feeding site facilitating replication or transmission of LGTV.  We are currently developing methods to introduce dsRNA into the tick to knock down this transcript and assess its role in LGTV replication and transmission.2. Comparison of TBFV infection in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.  TBFV are maintained in nature in an infectious cycle that involves both tick and vertebrate hosts. Thus, these viruses must successfully replicate in two very distinct systems. One basic difference between these two systems is that flavivirus infection of tick cells is persistent, whereas infection of mammalian cells tends to be acute and cytopathic. The genetic determinants underpinning these phenomena are not well understood.  A.  Viral determinants of pathogenesis in the arthropod vector and the mammalian host.  In a previous study, we serially passaged LGTV in either tick or mouse cell lines and found a limited number of amino acid mutations in these passaged viruses compared to wild-type virus.  Interestingly, the tick passaged virus exhibited reduced neuroinvasiveness when injected IP into mice compared to wild-type or the mouse passaged virus.  Viral RNA from the brains of mice moribund after IP injection was characterized and five recurring amino acid changes were observed.  Because of the location of these changes, we speculated that the amino acid mutations enabling neuroinvasiveness compensated for the mutations observed following passage in tick cells. We are utilizing a reverse genetics approach to introduce these amino acid changes individually or in combination into LGTV. These viruses will be rescued and tested in vivo to determine the role of specific amino acid changes in neuroinvasiveness.B.  Comparison of TBFV infection in mammalian and tick cells.  A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum.  These rearranged membranes host virus replication and may protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems.  In the case of WNV and DEN, viral non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) has been implicated in the membrane rearrangements during infection.  However, similar analysis has not been done with TBFV in tick cell lines. We are comparing virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal and electron microscopy.  Electron microscopy has shown that TBFV-infected mammalian cells exhibit virus-induced vesicles, ER proliferation and accumulation of virions as early as 24 hrs post-infection.  By 48 hrs post-infection, the virions assemble into paracrystalline arrays and large amounts of vesicles are observed.  Significant cytopathic effect is observed at later timepoints and the cells begin to die.  In the TBFV-infected tick cells, vesicle formation occurs later than in the mammalian cells. In addition, the vesicles have a different morphology appearing much more frequently as tubules in contrast to the round vesicles observed in the mammalian cells.  No virions were detected in the tick cells at any time point post-infection.  While this may simply be a consequence of the lower virus titer produced in the tick cells, these differences are currently being addressed using electron tomography to get a more detailed understanding of the virus-induced vesicle formation in the two different cell types. The results from the microscopy experiments will form the groundwork for biochemical and genetic investigations.',\n",
       " 'An appropriate vaccine is essential for a global pandemic preparedness and response. Hemagglutination inhibition assays reveal that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses are antigenically homogeneous and distinct from currently circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses. Based on antigenic and genetic analysis and epidemiologic information, the WHO selected the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus as the reference virus for vaccine development; inactivated and live attenuated vaccines for pandemic H1N1 were licensed in 2009. We have initiated clinical studies to evaluate the immunogenicity and infectivity of the licensed inactivated virus and live attenuated H1N1 vaccines in different age groups.',\n",
       " 'The HVS in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium, has developed several candidate live attenuated HAV vaccines. One such candidate was modified to become the currently licensed GSK inactivated HAV vaccine. In addition, the HVS has developed a candidate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine that is highly promising and that has completed phase II clinical trials. In studies to characterize this candidate hepatitis E vaccine, we performed extensive pre-clinical trials to determine the potency of the vaccine, the duration of protection, the optimum regimen for administration, its protective efficacy against homologous versus heterologous virus strains, its ability to prevent infection as well as hepatitis and the minimum antibody titer that was effective in preventing infection and hepatitis, respectively. In the clinical trial, the vaccine was 96% efficacious in preventing hepatitis E following three doses of vaccine and 87% efficacious following two doses.  The vaccine had no detectable side effects.  These results are outstanding for a vaccine.  GSK is currently determining its plans for future manufacture and distribution of the vaccine.  However, in FY 2010, progress in such plans have not been apparent and the NIAID is exploring other options for licensing the intellectual property for a hepatitis E vaccine.  Several Asian pharmaceutical companies have expressed an interest in making a hepatitis E vaccine, perhaps in conjunction with a hepatitis A vaccine.The study of HCV, including vaccine development, is complicated by the genetic heterogeneity of the virus, which has resulted in the recognition of at least six major genotypes and many subtypes.  Detecting and quantifying the virus requires different sets of primers for PCR amplification.  We have developed real-time PCR assays for the six major genotypes and have compared their specificity and sensitivity with other published assays.  In addition, in FY 2009 and FY 2010, we further characterized the six major genotypes of HCV by preparing chimpanzee-derived plasma pools for each and determining the infectivity titer of them by reverse titration in additional chimpanzees.  We are distributing these pools to the scientific community for vaccine studies and anticipate that they will be useful in furthering hepatitis C vaccine development.  As an extension of these studies and as an aid to furthering basic research on HCV, we are preparing infectious cDNA clones of those HCV genotypes for which such clones are not available (genotypes 3, 4, 5 and 6).  These studies are being performed in collaboration with Dr. Jens Bukh and Dr. William Satterfield.  Considerable progress has been made in 2010: infectious clones of genotypes 3 and 4 have been completed and their infectivity confirmed by percutaneous intrahepatic transfection of chimpanzees.  Less progress has been made with HCV genotypes 5 and 6.  Despite repeated transfection attempts, neither of these full-length clones was infectious in chimpanzees.  We are currently re-examining sequence data and attempting to replace parts of the clones that are suspected of being defective.  Repeated attempts to demonstrate infectivity of modified clones will be carried out at Bioqual Inc.Immunity  to HCV is poorly understood and there is controversy over how complete and how long-lasting immunity to prior exposure of the virus is.  This has implications for preventing chronic infections and their sequelae, cirrhosis and liver cancer.  We have demonstrated that immunity to repeated exposure to HCV is genotype-specific, incomplete and relatively short-lived: even reexposure to the homologous virus can result in persistent infection.In other studies, GB virus-B (GBV-B) immunity was further studied. GBV-B is the closest relative to hepatitis C virus, which is very difficult to study because it is  transmissible only to chimpanzees. In contrast, GBV-B is transmissible to tamarins, a species of New World monkey not considered to be endangered. Tamarins that had previously been infected with GBV-B were re-challenged with the same virus and shown to be immune to reinfection; this immunity was long-lived and apparently more complete than immunity to HCV in chimpanzees and humans.  In additional studies to further characterize the similarity between infections by HCV and by GBV-B, in FY 2009 and FY 2010, we have examined the mutation rate of acute, self-limiting versus chronic GBV-B infections in tamarins and demonstrated genetic changes similar to those observed in HCV infections.  To date, liver cancer has not been observed in chronic GBV-B infections, perhaps because chronic infections are so uncommon, but we will monitor any additional chronically infected animals for evidence of liver cancer.In 2008, in collaboration with Michael Houghton (formerly of Chiron Corp.), we tested sera from the Chiron HCV vaccine trials in chimpanzees.  Specifically, we tested serial sera from chimpanzees that had received Chirons E1-E2 dimer vaccine (derived from the HCV-1 strain) that had been expressed from mammalian cells.  Testing was performed with pseudo-typed retrovirus particles bearing the envelope glycoproteins of each of the major HCV genotypes (HCVpp).  The magnitude of the antibody response against HCVpp bearing the envelope glycoproteins of a heterologous genotype 1a strain  (H77C) paralleled the degree of protection of the chimpanzees: those animals with a high titer of neutralizing antibody against HCVpp were protected, whereas those with a lower titer were not.  In addition, the neutralizing antibody was broadly cross-reactive, also neutralizing principally HCVpp bearing envelope glycoproteins of HCV genotypes 4a, 5a and 6a as well as those bearing the envelope glycoproteins of genoytpe 1a (manuscript in preparation).  We also tested in chimpanzees an HCV vaccine consisting of expressed HCV E1 protein, either with or without expressed HCV NS3 protein.  The vaccine was manufactured by Innogenetics N.V. and was tested under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the company.  In contrast to the experience with the Chiron vaccine, none of the chimpanzees was protected from infection or from persistent infection and none had neutralizing antibody to HCV as measured with the HCVpp test.  The decisive results of this study led to the abandonment of the E1 vaccine by Innogenetics.Also in 2010, we have developed the chimpanzee model for norovirus infection and vaccine development.  Susceptibility of chimpanzees to Norwalk virus was reported in 1978, when oral infection was documented.  However, the animal model was not utilized again until recently.  Using the same inoculum as used in the earlier studies, we could infect chimpanzees orally but only with very high doses of virus.  We demonstrated that it was more practical to infect them intravenously, a procedure that has been used extensively for infections of nonhuman primates with hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus.  After establishing the infectivity titer of the Norwalk virus inoculum, we immunized chimpanzees with recombinant viruslike particles (VLPs) consisting of the two capsid proteins of the virus.  We demonstrated that such vaccinated chimpanzees were protected against challenge with live virus and that the protection was  Geno group-specific.  Thus, norovirus vaccines will need to be multivalent to be effective.  We next plan to determine if lack of cross protection exists within Geno groups.',\n",
       " 'Aim 1: We found that proteolytic cleavage dictates different cellular localization and functions of p12. The removal of a non-canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention/retrieval signal within the amino terminus of p12 is necessary for trafficking to the Golgi apparatus and generation of a completely cleaved 8kD protein. The 8kD protein in turn traffics to the cell surface, is recruited to the immunological synapse following T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation and down-regulates TCR proximal signaling. The uncleaved 12kD form of p12 resides in the ER and interacts with the beta and gamma chains of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), the heavy chain of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, as well as calreticulin and calnexin. Genetic analysis of ORF-I from ex vivo samples of HTLV-I-infected patients reveals predominant amino acid substitutions within ORF-I that inhibit proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that ER associated functions of p12I may contribute to the survival and proliferation of the infected T-cells in the host Our previous work suggested that the effects of the ORF-I proteins on the IL-2 R, STAT-5, and MHC-I occur in a pre-Golgi compartment and is likely mediated by the 12kD form. However, because those experiments were performed with an ORF-I cDNA that also encoded the 8kD form, we need to evaluate whether the 8kD form affects surface expression of the IL-2 R MHC-I, ICAM1 and ICAM34 as well. We have generated lentivirus vectors that express both ORF-I isoforms individually and plan to characterize the effect of these proteins on the expression and recycling of these receptors. We will test whether this effect is due to the decrease in the phosphorylation of N-WASP, a protein which regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling, resulting in disruption of cell-spreading and formation of actin-rich circumferential rings following surface-supported TCR stimulation. We plan to determine whether the 8kD protein physically interacts with the TCR and affects the distribution of other T-cell signaling molecules. Our NCI collaborators, F. Ruscetti and K. Jones, have shown that HTLV-I virions can productively infect (cis-infection)monocyte-derived dendritic cells and that DCs exposed to HTLV-I transfer virus to T-cells (trans-fection). Since DCs from infected individuals contain HTLV-I proviral sequences, we wanted to examine the effect of mutations in p12, p13, andp30 on the ability of HTLV-I to infect DCs. Using the in vitro infectivity assay of DCs, we observed that some but not all cell-free virus containing mutations in the non-structural genes efficiently entered monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In three independent experiments, we observed that ablation of p12 and p30, but not p13 or HBZ, dramatically decreases the ability of HTLV-I to productively infect dendritic cells. We are currently examining whether viruses carrying these mutations are also reduced in their ability to infect plasmacytoid DCs and whether any of the mutations affect the DC-mediated infection of T-cells. In future experiments, we plan to characterize the block to infectivity of DCs by the viruses carrying mutations in p30 and p12. Based on what is known about infection of other cell types, these two proteins may act at different stages of the viral life cycle during infection of dendritic cells. In macrophages, p30 interferes with TLR4 signaling, stimulates production of IL-10 and decreases the release of TNF-,IL-8 and MCP-1. We will examine whether treatment of DCs with drugs that downregulate TLR4, and/or block TLR4-mediated signaling, restores the infectivity of p30 mutant viruses on these cells in vitro. p12 binds to the vacuolar ATPase which regulates the pH in the endosomes and indeed p12 is found in early and recycling endosomes. p12 may affect the pH in endosomes and thus decrease viral stability and release. This year we reviewed the main functions of the HTLV-1 Orf -I products. The 12 kDa product from orf-I (p12) is proteolytically cleaved within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate the 8 kDa protein (p8). At the steady state, both proteins are expressed at similar levels in transfected T-cells. The p12 protein remains in the ER and cis-Golgi, whereas the p8 protein traffics to the cell surface and is recruited to the immunological synapse. The p12 and the p8 proteins have seemingly opposite effects on T-cells; the ER resident p12, modulates T-cell activation and proliferation, whereas p8 induces T-cell anergy. The p8 protein also increases the formation of cellular conduits, is transferred to neighboring T-cells, and increases virus transmission. The requirement for HTLV-1 infectivity of orf-I is demonstrated by the loss of virus infectivity in macaques exposed to an engineered virus, whereby expression of orf-I was ablated. Altogether the current knowledge demonstrates that the concerted activity of p8 and p12 is essential for the persistence of virus infected cells in the host Aim 2: Non-structural protein in HTLV-I persistence in the rabbit model, although the rabbit (Leporidae) model of HTLV-I infection has proved very useful to investigate certain aspects of HTLV-I transmission, latency and persistence, it is severely limited by the few reagents available to assess and manipulate the immune response and assess the role of nonstructural HTLV-I proteins in the contest of altered host immune response. Given the cost of studies in non-human primates, we first used rabbits to test the in vivo stability of point mutations introduced into the HTLV-I genome. Because we observed lack of reversion of the point mutations introduced in the HTLV-I mutants in rabbits, we have proceeded to infect Rhesus Macaques (RMs). Rhesus Macaques have been chosen as a model because we have extensive experience in measuring immune responses and manipulating different subsets of immune cells in this animal species. In contrast, all animals exposed to the HBZ knock out virus seroconverted to HTLV-I antigens. Analysis of the virus load levels over time, the extent of viral persistence, and verification of the genotype of the viruses recovered from these animals is ongoing. Macaque model of HTLV-I infection will help address how important the T-cell and B-cell immune response is in the control of this viral infection. The evidence that HTLV-I is controlled by T-cells, though likely remains indirect. In the case that T-cells contribute to the control of virus levels, we will test the effect of CD8 T-cell depletion on provirus load in HTLV-I infected macaques. We observed reversion of the HTLV-1 mutants to the HTLV-1 wild type genotype in none of the inoculated rabbits. In contrast, in macaques, the absence of HBZ was associated with reversion of the mutant virus to the wild type genotype in three of the four animals within weeks from infection and these animals sera recognized HTLV-1 antigens. Similarly, reversion to the wild type was observed in two of the four macaque inoculated with the p30 mutant but only one of these animals fully sero-converted. The four macaques exposed to the p12 knock remained sero-negative and only two animals were positive at a single time point for viral DNA in tissues. Interestingly, we found that the p12 and the p30 mutants were also severely impaired in their ability to replicate in human dendritic cells. These data suggest that infection of dendritic cells may be required for the establishment and maintenance of HTLV-1 infection in primate species. The p30 protein requirement in dendritic cells likely relates to the observation that p30 affects the release of cytokines important for maturation of human macrophage. Further work is necessary to address both of these hypotheses.',\n",
       " 'An experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease is critical for the study of human AIDS. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. The purpose of this project is to investigate host and viral factors involved in variable disease progression in SIV-infected macaques and the lack of disease in African primates infected with their own strains of SIV.&#8232;&#8232;PATHOGENESIS OF SIVsm-INFECTION OF MACAQUES:&#8232;To investigate the role of host factors in SIV-infection of macaques, we used a well-defined molecularly cloned virus (SIVsmE543-3). Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that PBMC of individual macaques show vastly different susceptibility to SIVsmE543-3 infection in vitro and susceptibility is predictive of subsequent plasma viremia following inoculation. Recent studies have now identified that this difference is attributable to allelic polymorphisms in the SPRY domain of TRIM5 alpha gene. In contrast, SIVmac appears to be uniquely adapted for resistance to multiple alleles of rhesus macaque TRIM5.  We evaluated the effect of expression of the restrictive alleles on subsequent viremia in a cohort of 43 rhesus SIVsmE543-3-infected rhesus macaques.   The restrictive genotypes were associated with significantly lower viremia than observed in macaques with the permissive genotype, as well as emergence of escape mutations in the SIV capsid protein.  The specific amino acid substitutions found in viruses that escaped from TRIM5 restriction are presently being introduced into an E543-3 background in an effort to generate more reproducible viremia.  This difference in susceptibility to TRIM5 polymorphism between SIVsm and SIVmac may explain the greater degree of protection achieved in immunized macaques challenged with repeated low dose intrarectal challenges with SIVsmE660 versus SIVmac251.Full length infectious clones of the related challenge stock, SIVsmE660 have also been generated by close to full length RT-PCR from the virus stock.  Three of these viruses replicate efficiently in rhesus PBMC in vitro and their susceptibility to TRIM5 is under investigation. Two clones are presently being evaluated for in vivo viral replication and pathogenesis in rhesus macaques following both intravenous and intrarectal inoculation. SIV NEUROPATHOGENESIS.  SIV and HIV are both associated with the development of encephalitis. For HIV, the onset of AIDS dementia is generally a late stage finding. In contrast, most models of SIV encephalitis (SIVE) use animals that progress rapidly to disease. We observed a small number of conventional progressors that developed SIVE. The evolution of SIV in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was compared with the virus that evolved in the plasma of two rhesus macaques that developed SIVE. While the virus in the CSF and plasma were similar during primary infection, distinct substitutions were observed sequentially in the two compartments. These findings are consistent with compartmentalization between the brain and blood during development of neuro-AIDS and the evolution of viruses with distinct genotypes and potentially distinct biological phenotypes in the brain. One of these isolates, SIVsmH631Br induced SIVE in one of four macaques; virus isolated from the brain off this animal (SIVsmH783Br) induced SIVE in 3 of the 4 animals that have progressed to endstage disease with two additional animals still under study. Evolution of virus in the brain, CSF, blood and lymphoid tissues will be evaluated using deep sequencing and single genome amplification of selected samples and full length infectious clones representative of this virus will be generated. ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION OF NATURAL HOST SPECIES.  A second goal of this project is to study the mechanisms underlying the lack of pathogenicity of SIV for their natural host species, with emphasis on SIVagm from vervet monkeys. SIVagm is capable of inducing AIDS in PT macaques but African green monkeys (AGM) do not develop overt signs of disease following infection.&#8232;We perturbed the development of adaptive immune responses by combined administration of anti-CD8 and CD20 antibodies during primary infection of PTM, and AGM and compared these animals to historical controls infected with the same virus. Depletion resulted in a 1-log increase in primary viremia and a 4-log increase in post-acute viremia in PTM and three of the four PTM were euthanized within 6 weeks of inoculation due to massive CMV reactivation and disease. In contrast, all four lymphocyte-depleted AGM remained healthy. Plasma viremia showed only a brief trend to a higher level viremia during primary infection but the groups were indistinguishable during chronic infection. These data suggest that adaptive immune responses are critical in pathogenic SIV infection in PTM. However, the maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms including non-adaptive immune mechanisms. In a study of a cohort of SIV-infected and nave vervet AGM, we found that many of the CD4+ T cells from African green monkeys down-regulate CD4 in vivo as they enter the memory pool and that this occurs independent of SIV infection. These CD4-negative memory T cells maintain functions that are normally attributed to CD4 T cells including production of IL-2, production of IL-17, expression of FoxP3 and expression of CD40L; however lack of CD4 expression apparently protects these activated cells from infection by SIVagm in vivo. Thus the absence of SIV-induced disease progression in natural hosts species may be partially explained by preservation of a subset of T cells that maintain CD4 T cell function while being resistant to SIV-infection in vivo.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and its impact is not yet fully understood. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus in toto. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. With our collaborator, Professor John S. Oxford, post-mortem records of fatal pneumonia cases from 1908-1928 were screened to identify putative influenza cases based on clinical history and post-mortem pathology findings. Promising cases were sectioned for subsequent molecular screening. Sections of post-mortem lung tissues are currently being examined for the presence of influenza A virus RNA fragments by RT-PCR methods previously used to characterize the 1918 pandemic virus from similar samples.1. Determining the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus:Because the 1918 virus sequence was determined by designing degenerate, overlapping RT-PCR primer sets, the terminal segment sequences, reflecting the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), could not be determined using this method. In experimental pathogenesis experiments rescued influenza viruses containing 1918 gene segments have been chimeras with UTR sequences from the mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 H1N1 virus. It is possible that differences in the native 1918 virus may affect the results of pathogenesis studies. Thus, we have sought to use novel modifications of the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methodologies to determine the native 1918 segment UTR sequences from the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 strain. Additionally, 7 of the coding sequences of the 1918 virus were previously determined from this strain, but the full-length HA sequence was only determined from A/South Carolina/1/1918. Thus, we also sought to complete the HA2 domain sequence of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 in addition to the UTRs to give a complete genomic sequence from one pandemic case. The HA2 sequence was completed and found to match the A/South Carolina/1/1918 sequence exactly. Using novel RACE approaches, the complete UTR sequences of the 1918 virus were determined. Several differences between 1918 and WSN33 have been observed in the UTRs of the gene segments. This year, rescue plasmids containing the 1918 virus coding sequences with the UTRs of A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/New Yorl/312/2001 (H1N1, and the A/Brevig Mission/1918 (H1N1) have been constructed. Once these viruses are rescued, comparative pathogenesis analyses will be performed.2. Identification of pre-1918 and post-1918 influenza A virus cDNA-positive human pneumonia autopsy cases:Autopsy case records from the Royal London Hospital from 1907-1935 were screened for possible influenza pneumonia cases in collaboration with John Oxford, and the 20 most promising cases per year were sampled for molecular analysis. Additional 1918 autopsy cases from the AFIP were also screened. These efforts involve archevirologic surveys for pre-1918 human IAV RNA-positive autopsy cases to determine: 1) which subtype(s) of influenza A virus circulated in humans prior to the H1N1 pandemic in 1918; and 2) whether the 1918 pandemic virus retained any gene segment(s) from the previously circulating strain. Examination of post-1918 cases would allow study of the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses in the post-pandemic era before viral isolation in 1933, and allow characterization of virulence factors in the 1918 virus by comparison with less pathogenic but highly related viruses from the mid-1920s.Pre-1918 cases: Several pre-1918 cases were positive in an initial RT-PCR screen for the matrix gene, from 1910-1917. 1918 second wave cases: During an initial screening by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, an additional 26 second wave (fall wave) cases were screened by RT-PCR and 5 new positive cases were identified. Sequence analysis of the HA1 domain of the hemagglutinin gene was performed this year on these cases, and this has revealed novel polymorphisms compared to the previously sequenced 1918 cases. Post-1918 cases: Several positive cases were identified from the mid 1920s. Methods to produce cDNA libraries from this archival material for next generation sequencing are currently being developed.3. Re-evaluation of the histopathology in 1918 influenza cases:We performed a detailed histopathologic review of available 1918 pandemic influenza autopsy cases from the archives of the AFIP including immunohistochemistry for influenza viral antigen distribution. Tissue Gram stains to identify co-infecting bacteria were also performed. The distribution of viral antigen is similar to that observed from autopsy studies performed on fatal 2009 pandemic cases. Prominent staining was observed in the respiratory epithelium of the tracheobronchial tree, but with clear evidence of viral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. The vast majority of cases contained bacteria, and most contained bacteria histologically consistent with Streptococcus and/or Staphylococcus species. One such case also showed abundant erythrocyte sickling. DNA sequence analysis of the hemoglobin beta gene identified the mutation associated with sickle cell anemia.',\n",
       " 'Dengue serotype 1 vaccine development: The live attenuated DEN1 vaccine candidate virus rDEN1del30 has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and was found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies have been fully enrolled to determine the number of doses and the timing of the doses needed to achieve optimal immunization. The studies involve two doses of vaccine given at an interval of 4 or 6 months. The results will be fully reported pending complete analysis, but preliminary analysis indicates that the first dose is highly immunogenic but the second dose is poorly infectious at 6 months. A separate clinical trial to determine the 50% infectious dose (HID50) was initiated this year and preliminary results indicate that at the lowest dose administered (10 PFU), the vaccine remains fully infectious. Dengue serotype 2 vaccine development: rDEN2/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine, rDEN4del30, have been replaced by those of the prototypic DEN2 NGC virus. The live attenuated DEN2 vaccine candidate virus rDEN2/4del30(ME) has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. It is a promising vaccine candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Additional studies were initiated to address the timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate. Results obtained this year showed that a second dose administered at 6 months did not boost the immune response to the primary dose, presumably due to complete neutralization of the second dose by the existing antibody. A clinical trial to determine the 50% infectious dose (HID50) was initiated this year and preliminary results indicate that at the lowest dose administered (10 PFU), approximately half of the volunteers seroconverted to DEN2, indicating that the HID50 is close to 10 PFU.Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development: rDEN3/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine rDEN430 have been replaced by those of a DEN3 wild type virus. rDEN3/4del30(ME) or placebo was previously evaluated at a dose of 1,000 or 100,000 PFU in 28 healthy dengue-naive adult volunteers per dose. Less than 40% of vaccinees were infected with either dose indicating this vaccine candidate is not sufficiently infectious to be used as a component of a tetravalent dengue vaccine formulation. Studies were initiated with two additional DEN3 vaccine candidates in which 1) the 3 prime UTR (untranslated region) of rDEN3 was replaced with that derived from attenuated rDEN4del30 to generate rDEN3-3D4del30, and 2) a pair of 3 prime UTR deletions were introduced into DEN3 to create vaccine candidate rDEN3del30/31.  A clinical trial completed this year showed that the rDEN3-3D4del30 vaccine was well-tolerated and 80% of the volunteers were infected.  In a separate clinical trial completed this year, the rDEN3del30/31 vaccine was shown to be well-tolerated with 95% of the volunteers becoming infected.  Both of these new DEN3 vaccine candidates are promising candidates for inclusion in a tetravalent vaccine formulation.Dengue serotype 4 vaccine development: We currently consider the rDEN4del30 vaccine our leading DEN4 candidate for inclusion in the tetravalent vaccine. However, rDEN4del30-200,201 is a live attenuated DENV-4 vaccine candidate specifically designed to further attenuate the rDEN4del30 parent virus. In a previous study, 5 of 20 vaccinees who received rDEN4del30 at 100,000 PFU developed moderately elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Mutational analysis of DEN4 revealed that the 200,201 mutation of NS5 greatly restricted virus replication in human hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cells. In pre-clinical animal studies, the vaccine candidate rDEN4del30-200,201 was shown to be more attenuated than rDEN4del30 in both SCID-HuH-7 mice and rhesus macaques. In a recent clinical study, the vaccine infected 95% of vaccinees and was well tolerated without inducing ALT elevations. Although virus was not recovered from the serum of any vaccinee, moderate levels of neutralizing antibody were induced.  The rDEN4del30-200,201 vaccine candidate is considered a back up candidate for inclusion in a tetravalent formulation should the rDEN4del30 vaccine candidate display an unacceptable dominance in the tetravalent formulation. A second back up candidate is rDEN4del30-4995, which is a DEN4 vaccine candidate specifically designed as a further attenuated derivative of the rDEN4del30 parent virus. In the recent clinical study, 28 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive 100,000 PFU of rDEN4del30-4995 (20) or placebo (8) as a single subcutaneous injection. The vaccine was safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. An asymptomatic generalized maculopapular rash and elevations in ALT levels were observed in 10% of the rDEN4del30-4995 vaccinees. None of the volunteers became viremic, yet 95% developed a four-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers. Thus rDEN4del30-4995 was demonstrated to be safe, highly attenuated, and immunogenic. Unfortunately, an asymptomatic localized erythematous rash at the injection site was seen in 17 of 20 rDEN4del30-4995 vaccinees and this virus will not be studied further. Tetravalent studies:  Clinical studies were initiated this year to evaluate three different tetravalent formulations containing 1000 PFU of each individual vaccine candidate.  Each formulation contains rDEN1del30 and rDEN2/4del30 along with the following DEN3 and DEN4 vaccine candidates: TV001 contains rDEN3-3D4del30 and rDEN4del30, TV002 contains rDEN3-3D4del30 and rDEN4del30-200,201, and TV003 contains rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN4del30. Studies with all three formulations are ongoing in cohorts of 20 vaccinees and 8 placebo recipients. West Nile virus vaccine studies: Clinical studies are ongoing with a live attenuated West Nile virus vaccine candidate, WNVDEN4del30. Studies at 1000 and 100,000 infectious units per vaccinee indicated the vaccine was safe with low viremia, but was immunogenic in only 80% of vaccinees. To achieve a higher take rate, a study is ongoing in which two doses of 100,000 infectious units are given six months apart. The study is fully enrolled, and preliminary analysis indicates that the vaccine given as two doses is safe and immunogenic.',\n",
       " 'Findings from FY10 are summarized below.1.  Animal models of orthopoxviruses and countermeasures. Cases of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection in humans are expanding in Africa and can be fatal in up to 10% of affected individuals.  In addition, the virus was imported into the United States in 2003 and caused a localized outbreak in the Midwest.  Based on the growing threat of MPXV disease and concerns that variola might be used as an agent of bioterrorism, we have continued to focus on the study of orthopoxvirus pathogenesis in animals and the identification of countermeasures.  We are exploring alternate routes of MPXV inoculation in nonhuman primates (NHP) to identify a model of infection that most closely resembles natural monkeypox and variola disease progression in humans.  The commonly utilized intravenous (IV) route of infection results in an accelerated fulminant disease course compared to MPXV infection in humans.  Our goal was to determine if intrabronchial (IB) exposure of NHPs to MPXV results in a systemic disease that better resembles the progression of human MPXV infection.  We have compared the disease course following IV or IB inoculation of NHPs with 10-fold serial doses of MPXV Zaire.  Classical pox-like disease was observed in NHPs administered a high virus dose by either route.  Several key events were delayed in the highest doses tested of the IB model when compared to the IV model including the onset of fever, lesion appearance, peak viremia, viral shedding in nasal and oral swabs, peak cytokine levels, and time to reach endpoint criteria.  Virus distribution across 19 tissues was largely unaffected by inoculation route at the highest doses tested.  The NHPs inoculated by the IB route developed a viral pneumonia that likely exacerbated disease progression. Based on the observations of delayed onset of clinical and virological parameters and endpoint criteria that may more closely resemble human MPXV infection, the IB MPXV model should be considered for further investigation of viral pathogenesis and countermeasures.  To further our understanding of MPXV pathogenesis, we have expanded our studies to include molecular imaging applications to investigate factors that contribute to the survival of severe orthopoxvirus infection or that might be used for diagnosis or prognosis.  One such factor, lymphadenopathy, is a distinctive feature of MPXV infection and was associated with disease severity in the recent United States outbreak.  We have used positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) with 18FDG as a nonspecific marker of metabolic activity to monitor inflammation and immune activation in NHPs.  Groups of two NHPs were inoculated by the IV or IB route, and one animal survived in each group.  Lymphadenopathy and increased immune activation represented by 18FDG uptake in the axillary lymph nodes (LNs) was evident in each NHP.  Retrospective analysis of the axillary LNs indicated an association between pre-infection immune activation and survival.  Both surviving IV- and IB-infected NHPs had significant 18FDG uptake in the LNs at the time of MPXV challenge with no clinical signs of illness, while the NHPs that succumbed did not.  Massive inflammation in the lungs of IB-infected NHPs was also observed, and bilobular involvement was associated with moribundity. Molecular imaging was successfully used to monitor disease progression of an acute, severe viral infection and identify two patterns of immune activation/inflammation associated with survival.We have continued our study of cowpox (CPXV) infection as a BSL-2 model of orthopoxvirus infection and a surrogate model of variola virus infection.  We have extended our studies in FY10 by demonstrating that IV inoculation with CPXV Brighton resulted in a uniformly lethal disease characterized by hemorrhagic manifestations.  Surprisingly, the uniformly lethal dose for CPXV appears to be at least 100-fold lower than that observed for MPXV.  Peak viremia levels reached greater than 8.0 log10genome copies/ml for NHPs infected with 5x10e5 PFU to 5x10e7 PFU CPXV.  Lesion counts were less numerous than observed for MPXV with typically 50 or fewer lesions present in CPXV-infected NHPs.  However, viral load in respiratory, lymphoid, and reticuloendothelial tissues was similar to levels observed in NHPs infected IV with MPXV. Investigations into countermeasures against the orthopoxviruses have also been pursued.  We are currently evaluating broad-spectrum antiviral agents in collaboration with Functional Genetics, Inc. for in vitro and in vivo activity against the orthopoxviruses.  In addition, a subset of host defense peptides (HDPs) with previously demonstrated immunomodulatory activities was selected for testing of direct or indirect antiviral function.  In vitro antiviral activities were assessed using virus plaque assays or virus-GFP constructs through the following: 1) co-incubation of virus with HDPs, 2) pre-incubation of host cells with HDPs prior to infection, or 3) administration of HDPs to host cells post-infection.  Two HDPs, as well as their protease-resistant all D-amino acid and retro-inverso analogs, demonstrated enhanced direct or indirect (immunomodulatory) antiviral activities against a broad range of viruses including cowpox, monkeypox, and vaccinia and were selected for testing in an intraperitoneal murine model of cowpox virus infection.  Efficacy was demonstrated for both the immunomodulatory HDP and the all-D amino acid direct antiviral HDP with 40% survival in the lethal murine model following a single administration of peptide concurrent with infection. Currently these studies are being repeated in both intranasal and intraperitoneal models of cowpox infection and gene expression analysis will follow using the most efficacious infection model for determination of a putative mechanism of HDP action in vivo. 2.  Countermeasures against viral hemorrhagic fevers.  A safe and effective vaccine against Zaire ebola virus (ZEBOV) would potentially be used by multiple groups including healthcare providers, laboratory researchers, and military personnel.  A vaccine could also be used to mitigate outbreaks in Africa and possibly be used to protect endemic nonhuman primate populations that have been affected by ZEBOV.  While multiple strategies for ZEBOV vaccine development have been pursued, no current vaccine is close to being licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.  Unresolved issues with current vaccine candidates include safety concerns, pre-existing immunity to vectored vaccines, and manufacturing and dosage obstacles.  We are developing an alternative vaccine approach in collaboration with Dr. Matthias Schnell using attenuated rabies virus vaccine based vectors that express the major protective antigen of ZEBOV, the virion surface glycoprotein (GP). Rabies virus based vectors have previously been generated that express protective antigens from human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and anthrax protective antigen and found to be safe, attenuated, and efficacious in mice and/or nonhuman primates.  The main objective of the present study is to determine the safety and level of immunogenicity of rabies virus vaccine-based vectors expressing ZEBOV GP as either live or killed vaccines and determine their efficacy in animal models of ZEBOV infection.  Currently, we have generated an infectious cDNA clone of rabies vaccine virus expressing ZEBOV GP and recovered it in tissue culture.  The recombinant viruses replicate to similar levels as the parental rabies vaccine strain and express ZEBOV GP in tissue culture.  Analysis in mice for safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy is ongoing.',\n",
       " '(1)\\tTo develop animal, especially nonhuman primate, models that mimic human disease:We have established nonhuman primate (NHPs) models using Cynomolgus macaques for several influenza A viruses including the newly emerged H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus (SOIV), H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza strains, H2N2 pandemic strain, and an H2N3 swine influenza strain. We used a recently established infection route that combined oral, intranasal, ocular and intratracheal inoculation of a total of 7x107 plaque forming units or tissue culture dose 50 units (TCID50). In general, the models differ in virus replication, clinical symptoms, disease progression and pathology. However, they do seem to mimic disease quite well as compared to human infections with the above mentioned strains.  Seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 & H3N2 lead to either asymptomatic or fairly mild disease in Cynomolgus macaques. Shortly after infection animals show reduced food intake and occasionally mild respiratory signs. Gross pathological changes are limited to a few areas in the lungs. Histopathological investigations of those areas reveal alveolar edema and fibrin, hyaline membrane formation and type II alveolar pneumocyte hyperplasia. Animals recover quickly form the infection and clear virus within the first few days. There is limited evidence for virus shedding from mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract. collaborators: Drs. Taubenberger, DeLeo, Katze, Kawaoka, Kobinger, and Richt The pandemic H2N2 strain A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) leads to a moderate infection compared to the seasonal strains with moderate clinical symptoms and respiratory signs. Lung infiltrates, gross pathology and histopathology are in general slightly enhanced compared to the infections with seasonal viruses. Animals clear the infection with a delay and fully recover. There is limited evidence for virus shedding from mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract. collaborator: Dr. Richt We have analyzed a total of three different strains of the newly emerged SOIV. Interestingly, we observed different degrees of clinical severity, gross pathology, lung infiltration and histology. One of the Mexican strains isolated from a moderately sick human A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) behaved similar to the pandemic H2N2 strain. The California isolate from a sick boy with moderate disease A/California/4/2009 (H1N1) was more severe and the Mexico strain from a cluster of severe cases A/Mexico/4487/2009 (H1N1) was severe in clinical disease and pathology. All animals survived the infection but the animals with the severe infection had not completely cleared virus at the end of the study (day 14 post infection). This clearly indicates that a variety of SOIV strains co-circulate with different pathogenic potential. collaborators: Drs. Katze, Kawaoka, Kobinger, Richt, and Taubenberger Infection with the swine H2N3 virus A/swine/MS/06 (H2N3) was also more severe and was similar to the disease caused by the California strain of SOIV. Thus, this newly described swine virus has potential to infect primates and could potentially also infect humans. collaborator: Dr. J. Richt. Overall, we have established nonhuman primate (Cynomolgus macaque) models for seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus strains which nicely mimic influenza-associated disease in humans infected with the different influenza viruses. In general, influenza A viruses cause disease with different degrees of severity.  The use of nonhuman primate disease models will in future support research on intervention strategies. (2)\\tTo identify and characterize determinants of pathogenicity in these animal models:To better understand the features that define highly lethal influenza viruses, we exploited a technology for the artificial generation and modification of influenza viruses (reverse genetics system). Using this technology, we have generated a consensus pandemic SOIV (H1N1) virus (parent virus). In order to study virulence of the different strains (isolates) and the mechanisms of pathogenesis we have generated selected recombinant viruses and characterized those mutants in vitro.  For this we have compared the genome sequences of two early circulating SOIV strains with different pathogenicity in humans; A/Mexico/4108/2009 (M4108) (isolated from mild case) and A/Mexico/4487/2009 (M4487) (isolated from a cluster of severe cases). Sequence comparison revealed amino acid changes in 5 genomic segments, PB2, PA, HA, NP and M. The recombinant viruses were generated on the background of M4108 by replacing the corresponding genomic segment using the reverse genetics system. We are currently in the process to perform in vivo pathogenesis studies in ferrets. Subsequently, selected recombinants will be further tested in (Cynomolgus macaques). (3)\\tTo identify potential targets for intervention (antivirals and therapeutics):The inherent virulence property of the 1918 virus together with the current pandemic of the emerged SOIV (H1N1) influenza virus and the continued pandemic potential posed by circulation of the highly virulent H5N1 virus indicated the need for evaluating antiviral options against infections with virulent influenza viruses. Therefore, the recently developed Cynomolgus macaque model for the 1918 influenza virus was used for a drug efficacy study. We demonstrated that oseltamivir phosphate is effective in preventing severe disease in Cynomolgus macaques caused by the 1918 influenza virus if given prophylactically. Efficacy was reduced in a treatment regime through emergence of oseltamivir-resistant mutants that lead to death of one of four animals.  This emphasizes the importance of implementing combination therapy and vaccination strategies early in a pandemic such as the current one caused by the emerged swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus. (4)\\tTo develop cross-protective vaccines and test their efficacy in the developed animal models.Our vaccine efforts have started in collaboration with Dr J Roses laboratory (New Haven, Connecticut, USA) using the rVSV vaccine vectors. The emergence in 1997 and continuance today of a highly lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) causing human disease has raised concern about an impending pandemic and the need for a vaccine to prepare for such an occurrence. We have generated and characterized VSV-based vaccines that express the HK/156 (clade 0) H5 HA from the first position of the VSV genome. These vectors induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses of different clades in mice. The vaccines provide complete protection against morbidity and mortality after heterologous challenge with clade 0 and clade 1 strains in animals even 1 year after vaccination. Post-challenge pulmonary virus loads show that these vectors provide sterilizing immunity. Therefore, VSV-based AIV vaccines are potent, broadly cross-protective pandemic vaccine candidates. In the future, we are planning to use these vectors in the established nonhuman primate models. ExpectationsThe studies will define determinants of pathogenicity by studying mutant influenza A viruses in vitro and in vivo (mouse, ferret, NHP models). We will further develop cross-protective vaccine platforms that could be applied in emergency response situations.  SignificanceA better understanding of the underlying features of highly pathogenic influenza strains and the development of cross-protective vaccines are urgently needed to prepare for the emergence and control of highly lethal influenza viruses. Therefore, the proposed studies are directly associated with the primary mandates of NIAID, NIH, namely the response to emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. The results are expected to have direct impact on national and international public health.',\n",
       " 'Background: We were encouraged by the results that a short treatment with the CTLA-4 blocking antibody MDX-010 was associated with decreased viral RNA levels in lymph nodes and an increase in the effector function of both SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, we pursued this approach and tested the efficacy of protracted CTLA-4 blockade treatment with and without vaccination or vaccination alone as a control. We found that protracted CTLA-4 blockade significantly increased T-cell activation and viral replication in primary SIVmac251 infection, particularly at mucosal sites, and increased IDO expression and activity. Accordingly, protracted treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody of RMs chronically infected with SIVmac251 decreased responsiveness to antiretroviral therapy and abrogated the ability of therapeutic T-cell vaccines to decrease viral set point. These data provide the first direct evidence that immune activation drives viral replication, and suggest caution in the use of long term therapeutic approaches that increase immune activation in the treatment of HIV infection.Another study showed that antiretroviral therapy treatment and virus suppression is sufficient to reduce death ligand but not death receptors in lymphoid tissue of SIV-infected macaques. We studied mRNA expression of molecules involved in programmed cell death (TRAIL and FasL) and their receptors (DR5 and Fas) in blood and lymph nodes collected longitudinally from SIV-infected RMs before and after antiretroviral therapy. TRAIL, FasL, DR5, and Fas expression were elevated in circulating CD4+ T-cells from SIV-infected RMs and antiretroviral therapy reduced both TRAIL and DR5 expression in peripheral blood, but only TRAIL and not DR5, in lymph nodes from the same animals. These findings suggest that antiretroviral therapy is ineffective in reducing expression of apoptotic death receptors in lymphoid tissue and that analysis limited to blood leukocytes may not reveal such a defect. Our results highlight the persistence of an underlying immunologic condition that may prevent therapy-induced restoration of CD4+ T-cells in lymphoid tissues. Interferon alfa Blockade:The early stages of infection present formidable obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection. Understanding and exploiting these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive infection in an exposed host. The early stages of genital transmission can not be studied in humans, thus, intra-vaginal SIV infection of RMs represents one of the best animal models in which to study these events. We will test the contribution of the early innate IFN-I response at the mucosal portal of entry to the establishment and rate of dissemination of SIV infection in RMs. We will inhibit the biological activity of IFN, IFN, and IFNIFNType I) by treating RMs with a blocking antibody, 64G12, that targets the receptor for all these interferons. Indeed 64G12 inhibits SIV-AT-2 induced IFN and TNFproduction in pDCs of RM. Specifically, we wish to test the effect of 64G12 on: 1) The establishment of intravaginal SIV infection in RMs and the rate of SIV dissemination to mucosal and peripheral LT, 2) viral and CD4+ T-cell dynamics and the SIV-specific immune responses, and 3) the levels of mucosal and systemic immune activation, and disease progression. The early stages of infection present formidable obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection. Understanding and exploiting these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive infection in an exposed host.  CQ treatment: Earlier in vitro studies indicated that CQ can block HIV envelope glycosylation and HIV replication. However, two small clinical trials reported only modest reductions in plasma virus of 0.4-0.6 log copies/ml.More recently, CQ has been shown to block HIV-induced immune activation as well as HIV-activated IFN production and PDL-1 expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in normal human PBMCs. It should also be noted that CQ was recently reported to enhance astrocyte permissiveness to HIV infection, raising the possibility of complicating and detrimental effects of this drug. We propose to study the in vivo effects of CQ administration on SIV infection of RMs. Anti PD-1 treatment:We found that SIV specific T-cells have a proliferative defect that may explain the inability of vaccines to eliminate infected cells. SIV specific CD8+T-cells express high level of PD-1 and cytokines, and have impaired proliferative capacity in acute and chronic SIVmac251 infection. Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) is a critical mediator of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. We examined the expression of PD-1 on SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells and its possible involvement in the regulation of cytokine production, proliferation, and survival of these cells. We found that the majority of SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed a PD-1(high) phenotype, independently of their differentiation status, in all tissues tested. PD-1 expression gradually declined on CD8+ T-cells specific for SIV-derived epitopes that had undergone mutational escape, indicating that antigen-specific TCR stimulation is the primary determinant of PD-1 expression. SIV-specific PD-1(high) CD8+ T-cells produced IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 under cognate peptide stimulation but had a reduced proliferative capacity when compared to PD-1 (low) SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells. PD-1(high) SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells were highly susceptible to cell death leading to loss of such cells after in vitro stimulation. Thus, PD-1 may negatively affect the maintenance of effective CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV/SIV, thus, manipulation of the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands could result in restoration of the T-cell responses in SIV infection IL-21 treatment: We have studied in detail the immunological damage induced by SIV infection at mucosal sites of infected macaques and found that IL-17 producing CD4+T-cells (Th17), a lineage of effector CD4+ T-helpers recently identified, are infected by SIVmac251 in vitro and in vivo, and their frequency significantly decreases at mucosal and systemic sites within a few weeks of infection. In animals that progress to disease, Th1 cells are over-represented compared to Th17 cells whereas, in SIVmac251-infected elite controller RMs, a normal Th17/Th1 balance is maintained. Indeed, regression analysis of the frequency of Th17 cells at mucosal sites and plasma virus level demonstrates a negative correlation, suggesting their importance in HIV/SIV pathogenesis. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic enteropathy in HIV infection. Thus, therapeutic approaches to reconstitute an adequate balance between Th1 and Th17, like IL-21 treatment, may be considered to ameliorate the clinical course of HIV infection.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. A single polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and at least seven non-structural proteins. The genome organization of the DEN viruses is 5-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3 (UTR  untranslated region, C  capsid, prM  membrane precursor, E  envelope, NS  nonstructural). There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) that circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million dengue infections and hundreds of thousands of cases of the more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) with children bearing much of the disease burden. DEN viruses are endemic in at least 100 countries and cause more human disease than any other mosquito-borne virus. In at least eight Asian countries, the DEN viruses are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Unfortunately, many countries affected by DEN viruses have very limited financial resources for healthcare, and the economic burden of DEN disease is considerable. As such, an economical vaccine that prevents disease caused by the DEN viruses is a global public health priority.The cost-effectiveness, safety, long-term immunity, and efficacy associated with the live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus, serves as a model for the feasibility of a live attenuated DEN virus vaccine. However, the development of a live attenuated dengue vaccine has been complicated by several factors. First, it has been difficult to develop monovalent vaccines against each of the four serotypes that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Second, an effective live attenuated dengue virus vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation of components representing each serotype because multiple serotypes typically co-circulate in a region, each DEN serotype is capable of causing disease, and the introduction of additional serotypes is common. In addition, the association of increased disease severity (DHF/DSS) in previously infected persons undergoing an infection by a different dengue serotype necessitates a vaccine that will confer long-term protection against all four serotypes. Third, it has been difficult to formulate a tetravalent vaccine with low reactogenicity that induces a broad neutralizing antibody response against each DEN serotype. Fourth, a dengue vaccine must confer protection against a wide range of genetically diverse subtypes that are dispersed around the world and can be readily introduced into a new region by international travel.  Fifth, a dengue vaccine must be produced economically so that it can be made available to populations that need it most. We have tried to address these issues as part of a program to generate a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. To maximize the likelihood that suitable vaccine candidates would be identified, monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN1-4 were generated by several distinct recombinant methods and found to be attenuated and immunogenic in mouse and rhesus monkey models. In one method, deletion of 30 contiguous nucleotides (del30) from the 3 prime UTR of wild type cDNA clones of DEN1-4 was used to generate vaccine candidates such as rDEN1del30 and rDEN4del30.   Point mutations previously selected for their attenuation phenotype were also introduced into rDEN4del30 to yield vaccine candidates rDEN4del30-200,201 and rDEN4del30-4995.  Because the del30 mutation failed to properly attenuate DEN2 and DEN3, alternative strategies were employed to create vaccine candidates for these serotypes. Antigenic chimeric viruses were generated by replacing wild type M and E structural genes of rDEN4del30 with those from DEN1, DEN2 or DEN3, and the resulting chimeric viruses, rDEN1/4del30, rDEN2/4del30, and rDEN3/4del30 were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys.  Two additional vaccine candidates for DEN3 were generated by 1) exchanging the 3 prime UTR of rDEN3 with that derived from attenuated rDEN4del30 to generate rDEN3-3D4del30, and 2) introducing a pair of 3 prime UTR deletions into DEN3 to create vaccine candidate rDEN3del30/31.  Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years, however, during the previous year, a clinical lot of rDEN1/4del30 was manufactured to ensure that a back-up candidate is available for DEN1.Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of vital functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications, including the submission this year of an IND for the clinical evaluation of three tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits, preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data.Efforts to develop a live attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine are ongoing.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with the live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory is currently in the process of recovering infectious virus from these cDNA constructs.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) is dedicated to translating basic science knowledge into clinical vaccine products. This requires the ability to carry out basic research, construct new vaccine products, perform preclinical research and evaluate candidate vaccines in human studies. To conduct human clinical trials, the VRC has established the infrastructure to produce vaccine products using good manufacturing practices, and to manage regulatory issues related to human trials. The public health burden of influenza in the USA is enormous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 5% to 20% of the U.S. population is infected each year (www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/index.htm), leading to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 41,000 deaths . If these figures are extrapolated to the rest of the world, the average global burden of inter-pandemic influenza may be on the order of approximately 1 billion cases of flu, roughly 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to half a million deaths annually . A recent spread of potentially pandemic highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype and a novel swine origin H1N1 subtype that already became pandemic has raised serious concerns about influenza vaccine supply in a pandemic situation when the currently available production methodology would be unable to meet worldwide public health demands. Also, antigen evolution in pandemic may necessitate a more agile, rapidly scalable production process. With recent emergence of a new pandemic influenza virus, the methodology and timeline for the vaccine development and production has become an urgent issue. It takes more than six months from identification of a pandemic influenza strain to production of the first doses of vaccine using licensed technology. Delays in traditional vaccine production could result from poor growth of the virus strain used to make the vaccine. Recombinant DNA technologies allow much faster development and production of the vaccine candidates that are based on viral genome sequences. Plasmid DNA-based vaccines have demonstrated preclinical efficacy combined with fast and relatively easy manufacturing processes. The plasmid DNA vaccines can be quickly modified to carry an antigen for which immune response is desired.  This process is more efficient than the cumbersome, costly and lengthy traditional processes involved with inactivation, purification, and concentration of native or modified HA antigens.  The disadvantage of current DNA vaccines is that it may take several injections to generate an immune response with a magnitude and durability considered adequate for protection. Therefore beyond the proof of concept aspect demonstrating ability to rapidly produce a vaccine, further development of ways to induce a desirable immune response by a single immunization may be needed in the future. An increased magnitude and broadened immune responses to DNA vaccines could also be achieved by using a prime-boost strategy.  Testing potential vaccine candidates in clinical studies may provide urgently needed data on immunogenicity of these novel influenza vaccine formulations and clarify if they may offer cross-protection in a swiftly emerging world of new antigenically distinct influenza viruses.SCOPE: The purpose of this project is to support various VRC Universal Influenza studies. Activities include: the provision of support services in all three areas outlined.

       " 'IL-7 is a non-redundant cytokine that plays a critical role in regulating the T-cell compartment of the immune system. Due to its ability to maintain the homeostasis of the T-lymphocyte pool and restore it under conditions of lymphopenia, IL-7 is currently under clinical investigation as a potential immune-reconstitution agent for various forms of immunodeficiency, including HIV infection. We previously demonstrated that IL-7 dramatically reduces levels of spontaneous ex vivo apoptosis in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from HIV-infected patients, while having no significant effect on cells taken from HIV-seronegative individuals. To investigate the effects of IL-7 in an in vivo model of HIV-1 infection, we performed a  study of IL-7 treatment during the acute and chronic phases of SIV infection in a well-established nonhuman primate model of AIDS. Previous in vivo studies in macaques chronically infected with SIV demonstrated that IL-7 treatment causes marked increases in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts without significantly increasing the level of viral replication. Likewise, Phase1 clinical trials in patients chronically infected with HIV receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) have demonstrated that short-term IL-7 treatment is safe and induces transient increases in peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts without inducing sustained increases in HIV replication.Our study included 12 juvenile Rhesus macaques divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=6) was infected with a pathogenic SIV isolate, SIVmac251, and received weekly injections of placebo; group 2 (n=6) was infected with SIV and concomitantly treated with fully glycosylated recombinant macaque IL-7 subcutaneously, once per week for 7 weeks, at a dose of 50 mg/kg.  They received no antiretroviral treatment.Multiple clinical, immunological and virological parameters were monitored in all study animals throughout the acute phase of SIV infection and during a follow-up period of 6 months post-infection. Importantly, treatment with IL-7 was safe.  IL-7 treatment caused no adverse side effects and did not increase the levels of SIV replication, while it positively affected the immunological profiles of SIV-infected macaques. Specifically, IL-7-treated animals had significantly higher absolute numbers of total circulating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells when compared with untreated animals, and this effect persisted throughout the treatment period. Strikingly, treatment with IL-7 prevented the early depletion of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells that typically occurs during the acute phase of SIV infection. In particular, IL-7-treated animals, unlike untreated control animals, did not experience a depletion of either naive (N) or central memory (CM) CD4+ T cells. This effect was associated with an increase in the intracellular expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but not with a sustained proliferation of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as measured by expression of the nuclear antigen Ki67. This finding suggests that apoptosis reduction was largely responsible for the reduced CD4+ T-cell depletion. This hypothesis was corroborated by studies in peripheral lymphoid tissue (auxiliary lymph nodes) showing that IL-7 treatment reduced the levels of in vivo apoptosis of CM CD4+ T cells, as well as of CM and EM CD8+ T cells. However, the effects of IL-7 were not sustained: The numbers of circulating N and CM CD4+ T cells dropped below pre-treatment levels within 1 month of cessation of treatment. Treatment with IL-7 also induced significant increases in the levels of all subsets of CD8+ T cells (N, CM, EM), which gradually returned to baseline levels after several weeks of treatment interruption. Unfortunately, during the short-term (6 months) follow-up phase, two animals in each study group showed early signs of disease progression with unusual manifestations, such as neurologic and gastrointestinal disease in the absence of significant depletion of circulating CD4+ T cells. This picture is in line with previous descriptions of rapid SIV disease progression (RP) in macaques, reportedly associated with a unique pathogenesis mediated by massive SIV replication in cells of the mononuclear phagocytic lineage rather than CD4+ T cells. Currently we are investigating the gene expression profiles of RP macaque lymphocytes using microarray technology. Preliminary data show differential gene expression at baseline in peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken from RP macaques versus conventional progressors (CP), with upregulation of B-cell-associated genes (immunoglobulins, MHC class II, B-cell activation markers) and downward modulation of T-cell genes, platelet/megakaryocyte genes and the IL-7 receptor gene. Overall, the presence of two RP macaques in each study group suggests that IL-7 had no effect on this dramatic and unusual form of SIV disease.Following the acute phase of SIV infection, IL-7 treatment was restarted during the chronic phase of infection. Escalating doses of IL-7 (from 10 to 50 mg/kg) were restarted at month 8 of SIV inoculation in the 4 remaining animals and treatment was prolonged for 3 months. Re-treatment induced transient increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which returned to baseline levels or below during this period. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 IL-7-treated animals progressed to AIDS and were euthanized during the following 4 months. In contrast, all 3 remaining animals in the untreated group were still alive at 18 months of SIV infection and were used for a short-term experiment to investigate the effects of IL-7 treatment on T-cell peripheral homing (see below).IL-7 also plays an important role in peripheral T-cell homing, although the precise  tissues targeted and the mechanisms of such homing are largely unknown. Thus, we have started to investigate the ex vivo effects of IL-7 treatment on the expression of a wide panel of tissue homing integrins and chemokine receptors. We have observed that IL-7, in the absence of any other activating stimuli, potently and selectively induces the expression of integrin apha4-beta7 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This effect, which was observed only at relatively high doses of IL-7 (those reached under conditions of lymphopenia), occurs primarily in phenotypically naive    (CD45RA+RO-) T cells.  It also is associated with the induction of the functionally activated integrin conformation, as indicated by increased binding activity for the natural integrin ligand, MAdCAM, and for HIV-1 gp120. Further analysis demonstrated that the JAK/STAT and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are both involved in upregulating alpha4-beta7 by IL-7. The induction of alpha4-beta7 by IL-7 also was confirmed in vivo in HIV-infected individuals and in SIV-infected macaques after injection of a single dose of IL-7. Preliminary data from late-stage SIV-infected macaques who did not receive virus-suppressing drugs indicate that IL-7 increased the levels of SIV replication and T-cell infiltration in the gut. Altogether, these data suggest a dual role for IL-7 in HIV infection. During acute infection, IL-7 may reduce the levels of apoptosis, thereby preventing the early depletion of CD4+ T cells. Conversely, during late-stage disease, IL-7 may favor homing and proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the gut, providing new targets for HIV replication and fostering the terminal depletion of CD4+ T cells.',\n",
       " 'La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, is a mosquito-borne virus recognized as a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America with 70-130 symptomatic cases each year. The virus was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960. The majority of LACV infections are mild and never reported, however, serologic studies estimate infection rates of 10-30/100,000 in endemic areas. LAC encephalitis has become the most commonly reported pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the US with 70-130 symptomatic cases a year with severe sequelae. For these reasons we are interested in developing a vaccine to prevent this CNS disease. LACV sequence analysis: To better understand the genetic factors contributing to disease, the full genome sequence of the five known human isolates of LACV and of 13 mosquito isolates was analyzed, and a high level of genetic relatedness amongst the 18 viruses was observed.  Two major LACV genetic groupings were identified that had allelic differences in the S, M and L genome segments. Group 1 viruses were underrepresented in mosquitoes (1 of 13 isolates) but predominant in humans (4 of 5 isolates), while Group 2 viruses were isolated predominantly from mosquitoes.  The presence of Group 1 viruses in 80% of humans with severe central nervous system (CNS) disease suggested that Group 1 viruses possess a higher encephalitogenic potential than Group 2 viruses. To explore this hypothesis, viruses from both genetic groups were analyzed for their neurovirulent phenotype in mice, and a representative virus from each genetic group was analyzed in nonhuman primates. Whereas the viruses from both genetic groups exhibited somewhat similar neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in mice, the primate model demonstrated that Group 1 human virus possesses higher neurovirulence, as defined by greater levels of virus replication in the CNS and more severe virus-induced neuroinflammation. This study confirms the observation that Group 1 LACV is more likely to be associated with CNS disease. Therefore, the low incidence of encephalitis due to LACV infection in humans may be partially explained by the observed low frequency of neurovirulent Group 1 LACV among mosquitoes.  Conversely, the greater prevalence of less pathogenic Group 2 LACV in mosquito populations may account for the asymptomatic or mild nature of the majority of LACV infections in humans. A detailed study of the neuropathogenesis of LACV for the CNS of non-human primates is ongoing.JCV sequence analysis: Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), family Bunyaviridae, is a mosquito-borne pathogen endemic in the United States and Canada that can cause encephalitis in humans and is considered an emerging threat to public health. The virus is genetically similar to Inkoo virus circulating in Europe, suggesting that much of the northern hemisphere contains JCV or similar variants. We have completed the sequence of three isolates of JCV collected in geographically diverse locations over a 57 year time span.  The nucleotide identify for the three JCV viruses is 90, 83, and 85% for the S, M, and L segments respectively whereas the percent identify for the predicted amino acid sequences of the N, NSS, M poly, GN, NSM, GC, and L proteins was 97, 91, 94, 98, 91, 94, and 97%, respectively.  In Swiss Webster mice, each JCV isolate exhibits low neuroinvasiveness but high infectivity.  Two of the three JCV isolates were highly neurovirulent after IC inoculation whereas one isolate, JCV/03/CT, exhibited low neurovirulence.  In rhesus monkeys, JCV infection is accompanied by a low-titered viremia, lack of clinical disease, but a robust neutralizing antibody response. A relatively high level of amino acid sequence conservation was observed even for viruses isolated 57 years apart indicating that the virus is in relative evolutionary stasis. JCV is highly infectious for mice and monkeys, and these animals, especially mice, represent useful experimental hosts for further study.TAHV sequence analysis: Tahyna virus (TAHV) is a human pathogen of the California encephalitis virus (CEV) serogroup (Bunyaviridae) endemic to Europe, Asia, and Africa. TAHV maintains an enzootic life cycle with several species of mosquito vectors and hares, rabbits, hedgehogs, and rodents serving as small mammal amplifying hosts. Human TAHV infection occurs in summer and early fall with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, and nausea. TAHV disease can progress to CNS involvement, although unlike related La Crosse virus (LACV), fatalities have not been reported.  Human infections are frequent with neutralizing antibodies present in 60-80% of the elderly population in endemic areas. In order to determine the genomic sequence of wild-type TAHV, we chose three geographically distinct TAHV isolates isolated over a 26-year period and are the first to determine the complete sequence of the TAHV S, M, and L segments.  TAHV maintains a highly conserved genome with both nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity greater than 99%.  In order to determine the extent of genetic relatedness to other members of the CEV serogroup, we compared protein sequences of TAHV with LACV, Snowshoe Hare virus (SSHV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and Inkoo virus (INKV).  By amino acid comparison, TAHV was most similar to SSHV followed by LACV, JCV, and INKV.  The sequence of the GN protein is most conserved followed by L, N, GC, NSS, and NSM.  In a weanling Swiss Webster mouse model, all three TAHV isolates were uniformly neurovirulent, but only one virus was neuroinvasive.  In rhesus monkeys, the virus was highly immunogenic even in the absence of viremia. Cross neutralization studies utilizing monkey immune serum demonstrated that TAHV is antigenically distinct from North American viruses LACV and JCV. However, we have also demonstrated significant cross-neutralization which may complicate virus identification since anti-JCV serum neutralized both LACV and TAHV.  These data also suggest that a single vaccine could generate a cross-neutralizing antibody response which may provide protection against CEV serogroup viruses from a wide geographic range.Vaccine development: Given our experience with antigenic chimeric viruses of the various flaviviruses, we sought to explore the possibility that we could use an attenuated LACV as a backbone to create antigenic chimeric viruses in which the coding region of the M segment of LACV is replaced with that of a second bunyavirus. In our efforts to create live-attenuated viral vaccine candidates for this virus group, we have generated a recombinant La Crosse virus expressing the attachment glycoproteins of Jamestown Canyon virus.  The JCV/LACV chimeric virus contains full-length S and L segments derived from LACV.  In the M segment, the ORF of LACV is replaced with that derived from JCV and is flanked by the non-coding regions of LACV.  Chimerization did not affect the growth of the chimeric virus in tissue culture, and the virus remains highly infectious and immunogenic in Swiss Webster mice.  Although both LACV and JCV parental viruses are highly neurovirulent in 21 day-old mice, with LD50 values (log10 PFU) of 0.1 and 0.5 respectively, chimeric JCV/LACV is highly attenuated and does not cause disease even after intracerebral inoculation of 3 log10 PFU.  Parenteral vaccination of mice with 3 log10 PFU of JCV/LACV protected against lethal challenge with LACV, JCV, and Tahyna virus (TAHV).  The chimeric virus was infectious and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and protected against the development of viremia after JCV challenge. The use of the LACV  genetic background to deliver M segment protective antigens from pathogenic Bunyaviruses other than JCV could be an efficient method for rapid development of vaccines effective against pathogenic bunyaviruses.',\n",
       " 'Approach 1: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) pseudovirions, is a technology developed by my collaborators, Drs Buck, Schiller, and Lowy, at the NCI. The human papilloma virus naturally infects vaginal keratinocytes; using HPV as a vector we can deliver SIV genes directly to the vaginal tract. So with this approach, it may be possible to elicit effector T-cells in the female genital tract. However, a limitation could be that,as the expression of SIV/HIV genes by this vaccine modality wanes with time, repeated immunizations may be required to maintain protective levels of effector T-cells in the vagina In the last year we engineered Human Papiloma virus like particles to express SIV genes. We found that intra-vaginal vaccination with HPV Pseudovirions delivering SIV genes induces both humoral and cell mediated immune responses in macaques. These immune responses were focused in the intraepithelial layers and the lamina propria of the vagina. Upon exposure with SIV we found that vaccine induced immune response quickly expanded in the vaginal tract, vaginal draining lymph nodes within weeks post exposure. This vaccine induced secondary response was however focal and we did not observe an expansion of immune responses in the rectum after intravaginal vaccination or intravaginal SIV challenge, In this current year we wish to test if these focal immune responses induced by HPV Psvs are sufficient to prevent SIV intra-vaginal infection.Vaccine induced effector responses at the portal of entry have been shown to be present in animals resistant to an SIV challenge, however, the only vaccine to show marginal efficacy in humans is a systemically administered canarypox vector ALVAC given in combination with the HIV envelope protein. Thus we wish to test if the combination of vaccine induced effector responses and systemic vaccination can protect from infection. For this dual modality we will prime the immune system with ALVAC SIV and then boost with intravaginal HPV vaccination. We hypothesize that this modality should direct the systemically induced immune responses to the vaginal tract. The rhesus macaque model is the best animal model of HIV infection. It has recently been shown that a single virus establishes most HIV infections and using repeated low dose SIVmac251 mucosal challeges rhesus macaques can also be infected with a single viral variant. W propose using a repeated low dose intra-vaginal challenge with SIVmac251 as our model system to test if our vaccine approaches can protect from SIV infection and/or high levels of SIV viral replication and the loss of CD4+ T cells. Approach 2: Induce effector T-cells in the gastrointestinal tract and will use heat shock gp96-Igbased SIV recombinant vaccines. This is part of a collaborative effort with Dr Podack from the University of Miami and includes the preparation of cellular SIV-gp96-vaccines secreted by 293 cells. Optimal dose-finding for SIV-gp96 vaccines in non-human primates was determined by specific CD8 responses. These cell-based gp96-Ig vaccines, by prolonged in vivo secretion of gp96-Ig-peptide, should imitate viral replication and provide immune stimuli comparable to attenuated viruses. ALVAC is an attenuated canarypox derived vector that cannot replicate productively in mammalian cells. ALVAC HIV-1 vaccine is a candidate HIV-1 vaccine, which is now in Phase III clinical trials and the results of this trail will become available at the end of September 2009. We have designed a study to improve the immunogenicity of an ALVAC SIV vaccine with the goal to test in parallel its efficacy against the high dose or the low dose repeated challenge exposure. In the past, we have tested an ALVAC-SIV vaccine candidate for HIV in an infant macaque model to assess whether this vaccine platform could reduce SIV transmission through breast-feeding. Infant macaques were given multiple immunizations during the first 3 weeks of life with recombinant poxvirus vaccines expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) structural proteins Gag, Pol, and Env (ALVAC-SIV or modified vaccinia virus Ankara [MVA]-SIV). After repeated daily oral exposure to low doses of virulent SIVmac251 significantly fewer ALVAC-SIV-immunized infants were infected compared with unimmunized infants. Monkeys not infected after oral challenge in infancy were rechallenged at 16 months of age or older by repeated weekly oral SIV exposure; unimmunized animals were infected after fewer SIV exposures than were animals vaccinated with ALVAC-SIV. When infected, ALVAC-SIV -vaccinated animals also had reduced viremia compared with unimmunized animals. These results suggested that immunization of human infants with poxvirus-based HIV vaccine candidates may offer protection against early and late HIV infection and were in contrast with the poor efficacy of these vaccines in adult macaques. It is unclear whether the age or the mode of challenge is responsible for the different degree of protection observed in these two studies. Thus, we are further investigating this approach for the following reasons: 1) ALVAC is an avian vector; therefore, pre-existing immunity is not a factor that could enhance HIV infectivity. This is particularly important in light of the recent results with the Ad5-based HIV vaccine trial (STEP trial) wherein a five fold increase in HIV transmission was observed in individuals (not circumcised)that had high levels of pre-existing immunity to the vector. 2)ALVAC-HIV alone may not be sufficiently immunogenic or protective. 3)We will use this study to test in parallel the degree of protection from a mucosal challenge exposure to high and repeated low doses of SIVmac251. Hopefully, the results of this study compared to the results of the Thailand Trial, will inform on the relevance of the two challenge models in predicting the efficacy of vaccines in humans. We also plan to characterize and compare the viral genotypes that are transmitted early in nave and vaccinated RMs by cloning and sequencing the virus via RT-PCR from the plasma. The scientific goals of this aim are to improve the immunogenicity of an ALVAC-SIV vaccine in a DNA prime /ALVAC-SIV boost and to assess cross-clade protection by testing a SIVmac251-based vaccine against a mucosal challenge with a homologous and heterologous virus, SIVSME660. ALVAC is a plaque-cloned derivative of the Kanapox vaccine strain of the canary poxvirus (CPV).',\n",
       " 'Flaviviruses are a group of positive-stranded RNA viruses that have a global impact due to their widespread distribution and ability to cause disease in humans and economically important domesticated animals. Several members of this genus, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are considered emerging or re-emerging pathogens because the incidence with which they encounter humans and cause disease is increasing each year at an alarming rate. There are more than 50 million humans infected by flaviviruses each year.WNV is a mosquito-borne member of this genus and is the etiologic agent of West Nile encephalitis. WNV is endemic in parts of Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East and has been responsible for periodic outbreaks of encephalitis in humans and horses. The introduction of WNV into North America in 1999 and its rapid spread across the United States into Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean identifies this virus as an emerging pathogen of clinical and economic significance for the Western Hemisphere. While seroprevalence studies indicate that most WNV infections of humans are subclinical, clinically apparent infections range from a febrile illness (West Nile fever) to more severe and potentially fatal neurologic disease. Currently, no WNV vaccine has been approved for use in humans and treatment is supportive.Cryo-electron microscopy studies reveal that the surface of flavivirus virions is covered by a highly ordered icosahedron composed of 180 envelope proteins. The generation of antibodies capable of binding to this array of viral proteins and blocking infection is a critical aspect of the immune response and an important goal of vaccine development. Passive immunization studies and experimental infections of immunodeficient mice demonstrate that antibody plays a significant role in protection from flavivirus infection. The importance of antibodies in vivo reflects an ability to directly neutralize virus infectivity, as well as several distinct effector functions mediated by constant portions of the antibody molecule. The neutralization potential of an antibody is governed by the number of sites on the virion available for binding (determined by epitope accessibility) and the strength of binding (antibody affinity/avidity). Using neutralizing antibodies that bind structurally distinct sites on the WNV or DENV virion, we are investigating the biochemical basis of potency with respect to how antibodies engage virus particles, and in what numbers. Our recent data suggest that neutralization of WNV requires engagement of individual virions with a stoichiometry that exceeds a required threshold. Our estimate for this threshold is roughly 30 antibodies.Due to the quasi-icosahedral symmetry of the mature virion, not all epitopes on the flavivirus are equally accessible for antibody binding. Accessibility modulates antibody potency, as some determinants may not be exposed with a frequency that permits neutralization. Thus, antibodies that recognize such epitopes may neutralize poorly, or not at all, even at concentrations that permit saturation because too few antibodies can simultaneously dock on the virion. Of interest, many antibodies that recognize poorly exposed epitopes on the mature virion still show neutralizing activity in vitro and protect in vivo. How antibodies engage cryptic epitopes on virions with a stoichiometry that permits neutralization is difficult to reconcile using existing static models of virion structure and envelope organization. To investigate mechanisms that govern the potency of antibodies that target cryptic epitopes, we are investigating the dynamics that control epitope accessibility and neutralization potency.Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection(ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of DHF cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. At birth, DENV-specific passively acquired antibodies are present at a relatively high concentration and exhibit neutralizing activity in vitro. However, as the child ages, degradation of maternally acquired antibody continues to levels that are no longer protective, do not neutralize virus, and enhance virus infection of Fc-receptor-expressing cells in vitro. The waning antibody titers of infants to levels that support ADE in vitro parallels the risk of DHF following primary DENV infection during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE. To facilitate this goal, our laboratory is investigating the biochemical determinants that comprise the enhancing character of an antibody, and the cell biology that underlies the mechanism of ADE.',\n",
       " 'Internal death programs play significant roles in many diseases.  Pathogenic effects can result from inefficient cell death or from inappropriate or excessive death such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during AIDS or the SAR-CoV virus during SARS. In this project, we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular mechanisms of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death programs in lymphocytes as well as other cell types. A major focus of our investigations are death-inducing cell surface receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as TNFR1 and CD95/Fas/APO-1.  Both receptors play an important role in stimulating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death of cells principally in immune processes. Little is known about how these alternative death pathways are entrained to receptor signaling.  Interestingly, both receptors can have effects beside death such as the induction of transcription factors. We are trying to understand how these receptors stimulate the intracellular machinery that causes cell death in preference to other cellular outcomes. We have devoted many of our efforts  to understanding the activation of a protease called caspase-8 which regulates the death program. We have characterized two death programs that emanate from TNFR1 and the Fas receptor, one which is caspase-8 dependent and has an apoptotic morphology and the other which is caspase-8 independent and involves necrosis. Interestingly, the latter death program is only observed when caspase-8 is inhibited. The regulation and molecular pathways of these two forms of lymphocyte death are distinct. In addition, we have discovered that inhibition of caspase-8 in non-lymphoid cells can lead to another form of cell death  exhibiting particular cytoplasmic double membrane structures called autophagy.  Although initially controversial, several labs have now shown that this form of death is particularly important for the demise of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. We have now shown that the mechanism of autophagic death program is selective degradation of catalase which leads to a marked overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage and death. Furthermore, we have focused on genes that play key roles in this process of death.  We have found that the human homologue of the Drosophila spinster protein, called hSpin, is essential for autophagic cell death.  We have studied the biochemical function of this protein and found that it is important for proper lysosome biogenesis and vesicle trafficking. In particular, it plays a vital role in lysosomal we formationat the end of  autophagy.      Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process from humans to yeast by which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are catabolized but very little was known about results at the end of autophagy when cells were selecting between autophagic cell death and survival. During starvation, the protein TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient-responsive kinase that controls cellular metabolism, is shut off, and autophagy is activated. Double-membrane autophagosomes sequester intracellular components and then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which to catabolize their contents to regenerate nutrients. Ourpresent understanding of autophagy is that it terminates with cargo degradation within autolysosomes, but how autophagy is controlled by nutrients and the subsequent fate of the autolysosome were unknown. We discovered that mTOR signalling in mammalian cells is inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated during extended starvation. Reactivation of mTOR depends on the degradation of autolysosomal products and release of nutrients. mTOR activity in turn terminates autophagy and stimulates impressive proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional lysosomes.  This process, that we term autophagic lysosome reforation (ALR), restores the full complement of lysosomes in the cell. This evolutionarily conserved cycle in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during starvation.     In parallel, we are exploring how the regulation of cellular death programs may play a role in cytopathicity associated with virus infections in AIDS and SARS.  In particular, a critical effect in the onset of AIDS following infection with HIV is the death of T lymphocytes caused by the virus. We have found that this death process is necrotic rather than apoptotic and have now identified two viral gene products, vif and vpr, that are involved in this process. We have found that vpr alters the cell cycle and promote death by binding to cellular proteins that have a role in cell cycle progression.  In order to study this process rigorously we have constructed a mathematical model to analyze cell death in tissue culture during HIV infection. Remarkably, both of these cytotoxic gene products cause says cycle arrest at the boundary of the G2 and M phases. The mathematical model reveals that the principal cause of cell loss is cell death rather than cell cycle arrest. We are using molecular genetic approaches to determine if cell cycle arrest actually causes cell death and how this might come about. The HIV vpr protein is a small protein (100 amino acids) with no obvious structural domains or enzymatic motifs other than three alpha helices.  We have determined that vpr promotes the formation of an apparently abortive complex between mitotic regulators such as CyclinB and Cdk1, and the theta isoform of the 14-3-3 protein which inhibits the cell cycle in the G2 phase.  The complex appears to be nucleated by a particular hydrophobic patch on the third helix of the vpr protein. We have also studied how vif causes cell cycle arrest and found that it is a distinctive mechanism from that induced by vpr.  We find that vif can alter the nucleocytoplasmic localization of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases which leads to disruption of normal cell cycle progression.  We continue to explore how HIV-1 alters to cellular  machinery to cause the demise of CD4 T cells.Further studies have revealed that the critical step in the ability of vpr to arrest cell cycle involves phosphorylation by protein kinase A.',\n",
       " 'Primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox, and reactivation of the virus from latency results in zoster.   We have previously identified a cellular protein, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), that interacts with a VZV glycoprotein, gE and functions as a receptor for entry of the virus into cells.  VZV gE interacts with glycoprotein I and the two proteins form a complex on the surface of the virus and on virus-infected cells.  Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infectivity and binds to a cellular receptor, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), through its unique amino terminal extracellular domain. Previous work showed that IDE plays an important role in VZV infection and virus cell-to-cell spread, which is the sole route for VZV spread in vitro. This year we found that recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) enhanced VZV infectivity at an early step of infection associated with an increase in virus internalization, and increased cell-to-cell spread. rIDE also enhanced the stability of cell-free virus over a wide range of temperatures.  A VZV mutant lacking the IDE binding domain of gE was impaired for syncytia formation and membrane fusion.  This mutant also accumulated on the cell surface and at cell-cell junctions.  Pre-treatment of cell-free VZV with rIDE markedly enhanced the stability of the virus over a range of conditions. rIDE interacted with gE to elicit a conformational change in gE and rendered it more susceptible to proteolysis. Co-incubation of rIDE with gE modified the size of gE. These data suggest that the conformational change in gE elicited by IDE enhances infectivity and stability of the virus and leads to increased fusogenicity during VZV infection.  The varicella and zoster vaccines used in the United States must be stored at -20oC or colder, and used within 30 minutes after they are reconstituted.  The ability of rIDE to enhance infectivity of cell-free VZV over a wide range of incubation times and temperatures suggests that rIDE may be useful as an additive for the cell-free varicella and zoster vaccines to improve their stability.Using the Oka vaccine virus as a backbone, this year we constructed a VZV mutant which has a small deletion in both copies of VZV gene 63 and insertion of two copies of a cassette containing (a) truncated version of VZV gene 62, (b) VZV gene 63 with a small deletion, and (c) full-length VZV gene 64 between VZV genes 64/65 and 68/69.  The virus was not impaired for growth in human cells, induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, and was impaired for latency in rodents compared with the Oka vaccine virus (p=0.0022).  Additional mutants containing the same truncation in gene 62, with or without the gene 63 deletion, were less impaired for latency.  A VZV Oka mutant, replicating to similar titers and inducing a comparable immune response as the Oka vaccine virus, but impaired for latency, might serve as a safer vaccine and be less likely to reactivate to cause zoster.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis C virus is both difficult to treat and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is not understood how hepatitis C establishes infection nor how some patients clear infection. To this end 83 humans exposed to hepatitis C were studied in protocol 00-DK-0221. The immune response (both antibody and T cell) was closely followed and is being characterized. The study is in collaboration with Dr. Rehermann. As an extension of this 28 patients with acute hepatitis C have been followed and treated as indicated. Twenty-five patients (16 women; mean age 43 years) had adequate follow up to be included in an analysis.  Symptoms in the acute phase were reported by 80% and jaundice by 40%. Two patients (8%) developed ascites and acute liver failure but both survived.  Genotype 1 was most frequent (72%) but many patients (20%) could not be genotyped.   Serum aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA levels fluctuated greatly; 18% of patients were intermittently negative for HCV RNA.   In follow up, 5 patients recovered spontaneously whereas 20 developed chronic hepatitis C or received interferon-based therapy during the acute phase.  Among 15 patients treated during the acute phase with peginterferon with or without ribavirin for 24 weeks, all became HCV RNA negative within 4 to 8 weeks, and all except two achieved a sustained virological response with the exceptions being HIV-positive.  Side effects (particularly psychiatric) were common and limited the duration of therapy in 30% of patients.  To further understand the virological determinants of infection and the development of chronicity, the hepatitis C virus sequence in the early stages of infection has been determined from the same patients. In particular the sequencing effort is focused on the viral sequence before and after treatment, in the two patients who were HIV positive and relapsed. This sequence is now being analyzed.Once chronicity has been established treatment response rates decrease significantly. One of the hallmarks of the hepatitis C virus is its sequence diversity, which is used to classify hepatitis C into different genotypes. Different genotypes have different response rates to treatment. Response rates are typically higher in genotype 2/3. Protocol 03-DK-0136 studies the response of patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotypes 2 or 3, to a decreased dose of pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin. 30 patients were treated with low-dose peginterferon alfa-2a (90 g/week) and 23 patients with standard doses (180 g/week) for 24 weeks in combination with 800 mg/day of ribavirin. Patients who failed treatment were offered 48 weeks of standard-dose treatment. Viral and serum IP-10 levels were measured and early viral kinetic parameters were calculated. Sustained virological response was achieved in 68% of the low-dose and 84% of the standard-dose treated patients (per-protocol, p=0.81 for non-inferiority). Retreatment was successful in all patients who tolerated full dose and duration. The standard-dose group had a greater first phase decline of the viral levels and faster time to negativity. The second phase slope was not affected by peginterferon dose. Although fatigue and general feeling during treatment were worse for standard dose, hematologic toxicity and depression did not differ between groups. Treatment with a lower dose of peginterferon is associated with some symptomatic benefit but the response is not equivalent to standard dosing. This has now been published. See bibliography.A second study for chronic hepatitis C was performed to assess the mechanism of action of ribavirin in HCV. This was done as protocol 02-DK-0065. Microarray analysis has shown that ribavirin may enhance induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The aim was to evaluate early viral kinetics, serum cytokine expression and viral mutagenesis during peginterferon treatment with and without ribavirin. 50 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-1 infection were randomized to receive peginterferon-alfa-2a with or without ribavirin for the 1st month of treatment. All patients then received 48 weeks of combination therapy. First and 2nd phase viral kinetics were evaluated. Serum IP10, MIG and MCP1 levels, representative of ISG response, were measured. Sequencing of part of NS5A and NS5B was performed and mutation rates were calculated. It was found that first phase decline was similar between groups. Patients receiving ribavirin had more rapid 2nd phase kinetics, particularly those with a good 1st phase decline (0.61 vs 0.37 log10 IU/mlmL/week, p=0.026). Induction of serum IP10 at 12 hrs was higher in patients receiving ribavirin than those receiving peginterferon alone (7.6 vs 3.8 fold, p=0.01); however like 2nd phase slope, the difference was more apparent in those with a good 1st phase decline. IP10-induction correlated with 1st and 2nd phase kinetics only in patients who received ribavirin. Sequencing analysis revealed similar mutation rates in both groups. It was concluded that ribavirin improves early viral kinetics, but only in those patients with an initial response to peginterferon. Greater induction of interferon-stimulated cytokines and the correlation with viral kinetics in ribavirin-treated patients, support the notion that ribavirin may act through augmentation of interferon signaling. This has now been published see bibliography.A second type of chronic hepatitis studied is hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is the most aggressive form of viral hepatitis as well as the most difficult to treat. Interferon therapy is the standard approach. Patients are typically treated for 6 months to a year. Relapse after cessation of therapy is the norm. In protocol 01-DK-0247 patients are treated with peginterferon for 5 years. The dose is titrated to maintain normal ALT and minimize side effects. Patients are evaluated before initiating therapy, and after 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients are excluded if they do not meet protocol-defined criteria for response at the 1 year evaluation. Enrollment was planned for 10 - 20 patients. Thirteen patients have been enrolled, and of the 12 who have had one-year evaluations 10 have met the protocol definition of response. Most of the patients were male (11) and tended to have advanced disease (median baseline Ishak fibrosis - 4). Patients were treated for a mean duration of 144 weeks (range 6 - 300) at an average weekly peginterferon dose of 184 &#956;g. At one year of treatment, inflammatory scores were significantly improved (10.6  2.7 vs. 7  1.9, p<0.01) and this improvement persisted in 4 of 5 patients who had a 3 year biopsy scored. There was no difference in the fibrosis score. ALT decreased significantly after one year (136  143 vs. 46  13, p<0.05) and persistant biochemical response on treatment was achieved by 3 patients (27%). 3/13 patients (27%) lost HBsAg after 24, 37 and 202 weeks of treatment and developed HBs antibodies. Treatment was stopped in these patients at least 24 weeks later; the serological response was durable and was associated with persistent improvement of ALT and platelet count during follow-up. Two patients (15%) died during therapy, one from hepatocellular carcinoma and the other from herpes colitis. Both deaths were not considered related to treatment. There were no other serious adverse events and treatment was well-tolerated overall. 3 patients required a dose reduction due to cytopenias. The primary end point of the study is the evaluation after three years although it is planned to treat patients for 5 years. Hepatits D and hepatitis B surface antigen levels are now being measured, once completed the final analysis will be completed and submitted for publication.',\n",
       " 'Flaviviruses such as West Nile (WN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), St. Louis encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses are important neurotropic human pathogens, causing a devastating and often fatal neuroinfection. During the past two decades, both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses have emerged in new geographic areas of the world where previously they had not been endemic and caused outbreaks of diseases in humans and domestic animals (TBEV in North Europe and Japan; JE in Australia and Oceania; Usutu virus, an African flavivirus, in Central Europe; WN in North and South America).Despite the availability of formalin-inactivated TBEV vaccines, there are more than 10,000 hospitalized TBE cases reported annually in endemic areas of Europe and Asia with mortality rate of up to 30%. An effective vaccine that induces a durable immunity against TBEV is urgently needed to protect humans since the geographic range and magnitude of TBEV infection continues to expand and increase. The inactivated TBEV vaccines produced in Europe are not licensed in the USA. The live attenuated TBEV vaccine candidates are being developed in the Neurotropic Flavivirus Section of the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV with a non-neuroinvasive, mosquito-borne dengue-4 virus (DEN4d30) that contains an attenuating mutation, a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3non-coding region. Chimeric tick-borne encephalitis/dengue virus (TBEV/DEN4d30) that contains the structural protein genes of a highly virulent TBEV demonstrates moderate levels of immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice and monkeys, but retains an unacceptably high level of neurovirulence based on the results of clinical observations and analysis of virus-induced histopathologoly in the CNS of monkeys. Therefore, further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4d30 neurovirulence was achieved by introducing amino acid substitutions that had previously been shown to reduce replication of tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) or DEN4 in suckling mouse brain. When three amino acid substitutions (Lys315 > Glu in the structural envelop E protein and Asp654Arg655 > AlaAla in the non-structural NS5 protein) were introduced into the TBEV/DEN4d30 genome, the resulting virus (TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655) demonstrated the desired properties of an acceptable live attenuated vaccine candidate. In FY 2010, a seed TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655 virus was generated, and we demonstrated that it was highly attenuated for neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, virus-induced histopathology and replication in the CNS of mice, and was unable to infect or replicate in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and Ixodes scapularis ticks.  The poor infectivity for both potential insect vectors reinforces the safety of this vaccine candidate for the environment and for use in humans. In addition, we found that the protective efficacies in mice immunized with a single dose of this vaccine candidate or with three doses of the commercial inactivated TBEV vaccine were similar when animals were challenged with wild-type Central European or Far Eastern strains of TBEV. Thus, TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655 virus is a promising TBEV vaccine candidate, but its ability to induce a protective TBEV-specific immune response and its level of neurovirulence in the CNS of non-human primates need to be evaluated prior to testing in humans. A live attenuated WN/DEN4d30 virus vaccine is being developed in the LID to protect humans against WN disease. In FYs 2006-2009, in the clinical trials in healthy adult volunteers, the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine was well-tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response at an immunization dose of 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 PFU. Further studies of neurovirulence in monkeys are necessary to provide the additional evidence of safety of this vaccine for the CNS of non-human primates prior to its use in the risk group of volunteers >50 years of age. In FY 2010, a comparative analysis of neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis of the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine versus wild type WN virus and yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine in the CNS of non-human primates was initiated and will be evaluated in a manner similar to that performed for TBEV/DEN4d30.Since neurotropic flaviviruses evoked a strong cellular inflammatory response and neurodegeneration in the CNS of monkeys, we have developed a high-throughput automated image analysis for the quantitative evaluation of the CNS infiltration with peripheral immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD20 lymphocytes) and the response of CNS resident cells (microglial activation and neuronal degeneration). We found that quantitative estimates of immunoreactivity for CD3 T cells and CD20 B cells correlated remarkably well with results of traditional semi-quantitative histopathological scores for cellular inflammatory infiltration in the CNS of monkeys inoculated with YF 17D, LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 attenuated viruses. In addition, quantitative analysis of immunoreactivity for neuron-specific antigen NeuN is a useful and reliable method for the assessment of neurodegeneration and neuronal loss. Our data indicate that a high CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in the CNS inflammatory infiltrates induced in response to YF 17D infection is a major factor that differentiates this successful vaccine from a more neurovirulent LGT or TBEV/DEN4d30 virus. It is likely that the balanced response of T and B cells within the CNS of monkeys induced with YF 17D vaccine virus plays an important role in the recovery from CNS infection and might serve as a reference to evaluate the safety of new live flavivirus vaccine candidates. In order to develop a general strategy for the rational design of safe and effective live flavivirus vaccines, we have initiated a project, in which we explored the ability of the brain tissue-expressed cellular microRNAs to control the neurotropism of flaviviruses, carrying complementary microRNA-target sequences. We anticipate that these viruses will replicate in peripheral non-CNS tissues and induce a strong adaptive immune response, but will be restricted in their ability to replicate in the CNS, since the CNS-expressed microRNAs will recognize the introduced complementary target sequences in the viral RNA genome and limit its translation, replication, and assembly into a virion. As a model virus for modification, we selected a chimeric TBEV/DEN4 that contained the structural protein genes of a highly virulent TBEV. The inclusion of just a single copy of the target for a brain-enriched mir-9, mir-124, mir-128, mir-218, or let-7c microRNA into the TBEV/DEN4 genome was sufficient to completely prevent the development of lethal encephalitis in mice infected directly in the brain with a large dose of virus. Viruses bearing a complementary target for mir-9 or mir-124 were highly restricted in replication in primary neuronal cells and had the limited access into the CNS of immunodeficient mice, but retained the ability to induce a potent humoral immune response in monkeys. This work suggests that a microRNA-targeting approach to control the virus tissue tropism could provide a new basis for future design of safe and effective live virus vaccines against neurotropic flaviviruses.',\n",
       " 'Summary: Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 170 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), there are 4.1 million persons who are anti-HCV positive, 3.2 million of whom have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2001, chronic liver disease was the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to study. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infections results in sustained eradication of the virus in 54% to 56% of persons. It is evident that a large number of persons do not respond to therapy. The current state of therapy is inadequate, expensive, and cannot be applied to a substantial proportion of affected individuals due to problematic side effects. Therapeutic options for non-responder patients and persons who do not qualify for interferon-based regimens are limited. Thus newer, safer and more effective therapies are urgently needed for chronic HCV infection.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have created a large database of untreated patients with chronic HCV (n700) and have analyzed this database to identify factors that affect the natural history of chronic HCV infection. We have published 3 studies on this cohort, identifying clinical factors and candidate genes associated with fibrosis progression. To further define factors associated with fibrosis progression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C, we have analyzed a large, well characterized cohort of over 1000 patients participating in a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of long-term peginterferon versus no therapy for patients with advanced HCV infection (HALT-C-see below). This study has led to over 70 publications. Most recently we have described the natural history of advanced chronic hepatitis C using 8 year follow-up data. This analysis revealed that 31% of patients developed a clinical outcome. Death and or liver transplantation were common. Another analysis reported that patients who clear the virus have a significantly reduced rate of clinical outcomes.Finally, we are validating the usefulness of a new technology, ultrasound elastography (Fibroscan), to non-invasively assess hepatic fibrosis. Results of the Fibroscan will be compared to liver biopsy, MRI elastography and plasma will be stored for future proteomic analysis. Our goal is to develop a series of blood and imaging test that will obviate the need for liver biopsy in most patients with chronic HCV infection.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Though therapy of chronic HCV infection has improved over the last decade, it remains sub-optimal. Close to fifty percent of treated patients fail to achieve sustained clearance of HCV. In the absence of other therapies for non-responders with advanced hepatitis C, one approach to prevent disease progression is to administer a therapy with anti-fibrotic effects over a long-term period. Limited clinical and in vitro data suggest that interferon alfa may slow or arrest progression of injury-related fibrosis, even in non-responders who fail to clear virus. The LDB was one of 10 sites participating in a large NIH sponsored multicenter study, the HALT-C Trial: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term peginterferon alfa-2a for treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients who fail to respond to previous interferon therapy. This study revealed that long-term therapy with low dose peginterferon was ineffective at preventing clinical decompensation and fibrosis progression in patients with CHC with advanced liver fibrosis. Although this was a negative study, the clinical implications are great because maintenance therapy should not be recommended to non-responder patients with chronic HCV infection. Ribavirin, a guanosine nucleoside analogue is critically important for the success of therapy for CHC. Several post-hoc analyses and one pilot study have suggested that higher doses of ribavirin may be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. Accordingly, we have initiated an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose ribavirin in combination with standard dose peginterferon alfa-2a for non-responder and relapser patients with CHC. Viral kinetics in the high dose cohort will be compared to standard dose ribavirin historical controls treated in other LDB protocols. Enrollment began July 2010 and 6 patients have been enrolled to date.3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyThe conduct of clinical trials over the last 30 years has allowed the LDB to acquire invaluable clinical material (patient serum, liver tissue and lymphophocytes) to which state of the art laboratory techniques can be applied to address issues of the pathogenesis of HCV infection and the mechanisms of action of antiviral therapy. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is unknown. Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis due to an increase in the viral mutation rate has been shown to be a possible mechanism of ribavirin in poliovirus, bovine diarrhea virus and GBV-B, viruses very similar to HCV. We have previously shown that ribavirin use is associated with an early, transient increase in the mutation rate of HCV but this effect was not observed at later time points. This suggests that lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action of ribavirin during therapy for chronic HCV infection. Our plan is to extend this investigation, examining the effects of higher doses of ribavirin and the effects of the combination of ribavirin and interferon on viral mutation rate.',\n",
       " '(I) Disease models and pathogenesis Syrian golden hamsters have been broadly used in infectious disease research but research tools are limited for this animal model. We have developed quantitative real time RT-PCR for monitoring about 60 hamster immune response genes. Subsequently, we sequenced the transcriptome of the Syrian hamster. We have established a uniformly lethal Syrian hamster model for Ebola. Hamsters showed severe coagulation abnormalities resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation as seen in patients. Cytokine gene profiles showed suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression early after infection and massive cytokine up-regulation (cytokine storm) at terminal stages of disease. We have established an Andes virus (bunyavirus) animal model in Syrian hamsters. We could demonstrated a strong suppression of innate immune responses during the early stage of infection and massive activation of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th2 responses during the symptomatic phase suggesting that infection-derived immune modulation  may be important to pathogenesis. In contrast to the lung, no activation of immune responses was observed in blood suggesting that Andes virus infection induces strong organ-specific but not systemic immune responses. We hypothesize that hantavirus replication and establishment of persistent infection is mediated in part via evasion of interferon-directed host innate immune responses. We could confirm that the glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses appear to be the primary antagonist of RIG-I directed IFN production.  In addition to already published data, we could show that the nucleocapsid protein serves as the primary antagonist in JAK-STAT signaling.  Furthermore, there may be a difference in the antagonistic effect of the NP based on the pathogenicity of the species from which is it expressed.We have established a uniformly lethal model in Syrian hamsters for Nipah and Hendra virus infections by the intranasal and intraperitoneal route. Clinical signs ranged from acute severe respiratory distress to severe neurological symptoms, including limb paralysis, muscle fasciculation and seizures. Interestingly, respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in animals challenged with a high dose, whereas animals challenged with a low dose showed more neurological symptoms.The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was characterized by increased pathogenicity in the elderly due to an early exacerbated innate host response. We have shown that both human and zoonotic SARS-coronavirus strains can infect cynomolgus macaques and resulted in radiological as well as histopathological changes similar to those seen in mild human cases. Viral replication was higher in animals infected with a late human phase isolate compared to a zoonotic isolate. Host responses to the three SARS-coronavirus strains were similar and only apparent early during infection with the majority of genes associated with interferon signaling pathways.We have established lethal disease models in African green monkeys for Nipah and Hendra virus infection. Animals showed severe lesions in lungs and brains which are the main target organs of the infection.  All Hendra virus infected animals reached pre-determined humane endpoints and were euthanized after 7-10 days due to acute respiratory distress. Upon necropsy severe lesions in the lungs of these animals were observed. All Nipah virus infected animals developed respiratory symptoms by days 8-9 and with the exception of two animals; this rapidly progressed to severe respiratory distress. (II) Vaccines.  The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors have shown tremendous promise in pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment. To increase the window for effective treatment against Marburg virus infection we could demonstrate protection of 5/6 rhesus macaques when this vaccine was given 24 hours after challenge while 2/6 animals were still protected when the vaccine was administered 48 hours post-infection. This supports the use of the rVSV in cases of emergencies such as laboratory exposures. The endemic regions of several EBOV species and MARV strains overlap in Central Africa. Therefore, a cross-protective vaccine would be very desirable. We could show that a one single-injection vaccine consisting of equal parts of three rVSV vaccine vectors is capable of protecting macaques against lethal challenge with Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), ZEBOV and Cote dIvoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), and Marburg virus. We are currently working on a cross-protective vaccine based on a single rVSV vector. Our studies demonstrated that the glycoprotein alone cannot provide cross-protection among different species. We have generated a new rVSV vector expressing the Andes virus glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Vaccination resulted in total protection against lethal Andes virus challenge in the Syrian hamster model. Preliminary data indicates that the new vaccine vector may also have efficacy in post-exposure treatment against Andes virus infection.   III) Potential targets for therapeutics.The cellular cystein proteases cathepsin B & L have been shown to play an important role in Ebola virus replication (in vitro) and thus could function as targets for therapeutics. Preliminary data suggests that cathepsin B may play a more important role than cathepsin L. We tested Ebola virus replication in cathepsin B & L knockout mice. Preliminary data indicate that cathepsin cleavage might not be important for Ebola virus replication in vivo. We have identified a new soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein (designated ssGP) generated through RNA editing of the glycoprotein gene. Biochemical analysis characterized ssGP as a disulfide linked dimer that was exclusively N-glycosylated and thus confirmed its structural similarity to the previously identified Ebola virus soluble glycoprotein sGP.  We are currently studying the role of the soluble glycoproteins in the pathogenesis of Ebola virus infection with the goal of defining new targets for treatment.  We tested the in vivo efficacy of a monoclonal antibody directed against the G glycoprotein of henipaviruses. This monoclonal antibody has potent in vitro neutralizing activity against Nipah and Hendra viruses. Intravenous application of the antibody as late as three days post infection completely protected African green monkeys against lethal Hendra virus challenge. We tested the in vivo efficacy of ribavirin treatment against Hendra virus infection in African green monkeys. While none of the animals survived the infection, a significant delay in time to death was observed in animals treated with ribavirin 24 h prior and 12h post infection. Interestingly, by delaying death the clinical symptoms shifted from primarily respiratory to primarily neurological. We concluded that there is little benefit of ribavirin for the treatment of henipavirus infections.   (IV) EpidemiologyRecently, a British citizen was evacuated from Mali and was diagnosed post mortem with Lassa fever.  In response to a recent imported lethal case of Lassa fever in the UK, small mammals were collected from villages in Mali including Soromba, where the infection was probably contracted. Mastomys natalensis collected in Soromba tested positive for Lassa virus RNA. Lassa virus was isolated from these animals and characterized by immunological, biochemical and structural means. Genetic analysis confirmed a unique Lassa virus, designated Soromba R, almost identical to a partial sequence obtained from the Mali-originated British case. These data demonstrate for the first time the presence of LASV in southern Mali. We developed a laboratory in Brazzaville to establish and support field sites for studies on viral hemorrhagic fevers in the Republic of Congo.',\n",
       " 'The extensive variation at some of the immune response genes is central amongst the host genetic determinants that contribute to the variability in risk of virtually all human diseases. We have studied the genetic effects of the highly polymorphic KIR and HLA loci, as well as other related, less polymorphic loci on several diseases. Our contributions to the general understanding of these effects are summarized here. An estimated 4 million people in the US and 170 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is the most common blood-borne infection in the U.S.  The vast majority of HCV infections persist and one-third of those with persistent infection will develop chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Several epidemiological, viral, and host factors have been shown to be associated with HCV clearance or persistence. Notably, a strong immune response to HCV favors viral clearance suggesting that genetic variation in immune response genes might contribute to the differential ability of individuals to clear the virus. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12979860, 3kb upstream of the IL28B gene, which was strongly associated with response to HCV drug treatment. Individuals with the C/C genotype at rs12979860 had a greater than 2-fold rate of sustained virological response (SVR) to HCV drug treatment compared to individuals with the T/T genotype. In order to determine the effects of this SNP on the natural clearance of HCV, we genotyped an existing HCV cohort, made up of people who spontaneously cleared the virus (388 people) or who had persistent infection (620 people). We found that individuals of both European and African ancestry with the C/C genotype were significantly more likely to spontaneously clear the virus. To date, this is the strongest and most significant genetic effect that has been found to associate with spontaneous resolution of HCV infection and points to a principal and fundamental role for IL28B in viral clearance.  IL28B produces an antiviral state by triggering a cascade through the JAK-STAT pathway leading to upregulation of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanism of how the rs12979860 SNP affects IL28B function and the immune response to HCV has not been elucidated. One clue to the mechanism may come from determining whether the SNP affects the outcome of other chronic viral infections where interferons and ISGs are important in the host response, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV). Given the dichotomous outcomes in both HBV and HIV infections and the importance of interferons and ISGs in these infections, we next tested whether the rs12979860 SNP associates with recovery from an acute HBV infection, resistance to HIV infection, and slower progression of HIV disease. The C/C genotype was not associated with HBV recovery (OR 1.20), resistance to HIV infection (1.04), or HIV disease progression (P greater than 0.05 for all outcomes). These results are in stark contrast to the strong association with HCV outcomes. Thus, the effects of this SNP cannot be generalized to other chronic viral infections. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of this SNP in HCV infection and how they differ from that in HIV and HBV infections. Variation at the HLA class I locus has a stronger influence on HIV-1 disease outcome than variation found at any other genetic locus identified to date. In support of this finding, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), for which we provided HLA genotypes, provide overwhelming confirmation of the primary role of the MHC in outcome to HIV infection in both Caucasians and African Americans. This observation in humans appears to be true also for rhesus monkeys. We performed statistical analyses that showed that specific MHC class I and II alleles are associated with control of SIV replication in this animal model. These studies were carried out in collaboration with investigators at Duke University (GWAS) and University of Wisconsin (SIV study). We previously showed that HLA-B*35-Px subtypes were associated with accelerated progression to AIDS as compared to the related B*35-PY alleles, but the mechanism for this effect was not defined. In collaboration with investigators from the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard we showed that the B*35-Px molecule B*3503 binds with greater affinity to immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4), an inhibitory receptor that is expressed on dendritic cells, than does the B*35-PY molecule B*3501. The preferential recognition of B*3503 by ILT4 was associated with significantly stronger dendritic cell dysfunction in vitro and a striking functional impairment of dendritic cells in HIV-1 infected individuals with B*3503. The data provide a novel perspective for the understanding of HLA class I associations with HIV-1 disease progression and for the manupulation of host immunity against HIV-1. Overall, the time to AIDS after HIV-2 infection is longer than with HIV-1 and many individuals infected with HIV-2 virus remain healthy throughout their lives. Multiple HLA and KIR gene products have been implicated in the control of HIV-1 but the effect of variation at these loci on HIV-2 disease is unknown. We determined HLA class I and KIR gene profiles of a relatively isolated population in Caio, Guinea-Bissau, with one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV-2 infection in the world. The HLA-B*15 alleles B*1503 and B*1510 were observed at a relatively high frequency in this community compared to neighbouring populations. Furthermore, HIV-2-infected individuals with B*1503 (but not B*1510) had significantly higher HIV-2 viral loads and lower CD4 counts compared to those without this allele, suggesting that this allele might be linked to poor control of viral replication and more rapid disease progression. Notably, none of the strongest HLA associations with HIV-1 were observed in our HIV-2 cohort. Interestingly, previous data indicate that HLA-B*1503 associates with low viral loads in HIV-1 clade B-infection, but has no significant effect on viral load in clade C infection. In general, alleles strongly associated with HIV-1 disease showed no effect in HIV-2 disease. In general, the strongest associations in this study conferred susceptibility to HIV-2 outcomes, while protective factors were quite weak. This observation is contrary to that observed in HIV-1 disease, where the strongest HLA associations confer protection. Perhaps this reflects the less pathogenic nature of HIV-2 and the ability of most HLA class I allotypes to effectively control the virus, as compared to HIV-1, where most allotypes are unable to maintain viral restriction. Our study is the first to provide a detailed analysis of the effects of HLA and KIR genetic variation on resistance/susceptibility to HIV-2 infection and disease progression. Genetic diversity of immune response genes, such as HLA and KIR loci, holds promise for explaining, in large part, the variability in outcome to viral infection amongst exposed individuals. Understanding how this diversity influences the immune response presents new opportunities for development of effective therapeutics and vaccines, justifying close scrutiny of these genes in viral infections.',\n",
       " 'Wild mouse species and the various inbred laboratory mouse strains differ from one another in their susceptibility to the mouse gammaretroviruses and retrovirus-induced cancers. These differences are due to variations in specific host genes, and we have been engaged in an ongoing effort to identify and characterize several mouse genes involved in virus resistance.  Our major interest has been on factors that interfere directly with virus infection and replication, and we focus our efforts on those factors that inhibit virus entry and the early post-entry stages of the virus replicative cycle.  At the level of entry, there are two types of resistance genes that target the receptor-virus interaction.  Receptors can be blocked by virus envelope glycoprotein produced by endogenous retroviruses, or resistance can be cause by polymorphisms in the cell surface receptor.  After the gammaretrovirus enters the receptive cell, reverse transcription and translocation to the nucleus can be inhibited or altered by virus resistance factors Fv1, mApobec/Rfv3, and TRIM5alpha.Our current aim is to characterize these resistance factors and the viruses they target, define the origin and extent of antiviral activity in Mus evolution, and elucidate the responsible mechanisms.  This work relies heavily on wild mice because laboratory strains provide only a limited sampling of the genetic diversity in Mus.  Also, wild mouse species allow us to examine survival strategies in natural populations that harbor virus and to follow the evolution of the resistance genes.  These mice additionally provide a source of novel resistance genes and virus variants.  One set of projects is concerned with cell surface virus receptors and these studies focus on identifying viral and cell receptor determinants responsible for virus binding, entry, and receptor mediated cytopathicity.  One series of experiments focuses on two unusual variants of the ecotropic gammaretroviruses that are cytopathic in M. dunni cells and also have altered host range.  These phenotypes are due to different amino acid substitutions at the same site in viral envelope gene of the two viruses. This substitution alters one of the 3 amino acids that form the cell surface receptor binding site.  The fact that these 2 viruses cause cytopathic effects in a cell line with a variant receptor gene suggests that the virus-receptor interaction mediates cytopathicity. This conclusion was confirmed by the observation that cytopathicity due to virus infection is seen in stable transfectants expressing this variant receptor but not in transfectants expressing the prototypical receptor.  We have now inoculated mice with this cytopathic virus to determine if the lymphoma-type cancer induced by the progenitor virus is altered by the mutations that cause cytopathic cell fusion.       In another series of experiments, we have been using phylogenetic methods to identify and characterize host genes that have had an anti-viral role in the genus Mus. Among the mouse genes responsible for resistance to mouse leukemia viruses is Rfv3 (recovery from Friend virus).  This gene was recently shown to be encoded by the mouse APOBEC (mA3) gene, a cytidine deaminase gene known to restrict other retroviruses in mice and in humans.  We sequenced mA3 from multiple laboratory and wild mice to examine its evolution.  We discovered that the mA3 allele in virus resistant mice is disrupted by insertion of the regulatory signals of a mouse leukmia virus that may be responsible for enhanced mA3 expression and altered splicing.  We also subjected the mA3 protein coding sequences to phylogenetic analysis.  We identified 10 sites under positive selection, 6 of which are in two clusters that distinguish the virus restrictive and nonrestrictive mouse variants, and that are known to be important for human APOBEC3G function.  We also showed that these two clusters are positioned opposite each other along the groove that forms the mA3 active site.  We thus show that mA3 has had an antiviral role throughout mouse evolution, and we identify an inserted regulatory sequence and two clusters in the protein coding sequence that may contribute to this antiviral function.     We are also interested in determining the extent to which virus resistance is mediated by polymorphisms of the cell surface receptor.  We seek to analyze the XPR1 receptor for the xenotropic/polytropic gammaretroviruses and for XMRV, a xenotropic virus-like virus isolated from humans with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome.  We have now identified a total of five XPR1 susceptibility variants in wild mice.  We have characterized the latest of these to be identified, Xpr1m.  We described the geographic and species distribution of the Mus Xpr1 variants, but failed to find the laboratory mouse allele of this gene in any wild mouse; this allele encodes a receptor that is uniquely resistant to xenotropic gammaretroviruses.  We used mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the functional contributions made by constrained, variable and deleted residues in this receptor.  Rodent Xpr1 is under positive selection indicating a history of host-pathogen conflicts; several codons under selection have known roles in virus entry.  All non-Mus mammals are susceptible to mouse X-MLV, but some restrict other members of this family of viruses and the resistance of hamster and gerbil cells to the human-derived XMRV indicates that XMRV has unique receptor requirements.  We also showed that the hypervariable fourth extracellular XPR1 loop (ECL4) contains 3 evolutionarily constrained residues that do not contribute to receptor function, we identified two novel residues important for virus entry, and we described a unique pattern of ECL4 variation in the 3 virus-restrictive Xpr1 variants found in MLV-infected house mice; these mice carry different deletions in ECL4 suggesting either that these sites or loop size affects receptor function.',\n",
       " 'The rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) virus vaccine candidate has been given to 35 unscreened healthy adult volunteers.  Only 4 of 35 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts with no associated respiratory illness.  This indicated that this vaccine was safe to proceed to the next study group, namely seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age. 13 subjects have enrolled (out of the final number of 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). Of the 6 recipients of vaccine that have been unblinded to date, none shed virus and there were no adverse events. This study is not complete, but these results suggest that this vaccine will be safe to proceed to the next study group, which will be seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (N = 30, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). HPIV2 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated intranasal HPIV2 vaccine called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that, like the HPIV1 candidate, included stabilized mutations. This virus was immunogenic and protective in African green monkeys. This vaccine candidate has been given to 15 seropositive adult volunteers.  Only 4 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts, which is the desired safety profile for an attenuated virus. The virus is safe to proceed to the next study group, which will seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (N = 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). Serologic screening and enrollment is in progress.HPIV3 vaccine: There are two HPIV3 vaccine candidates in ongoing clinical trials.  (i) The first is rB/HPIV3, which is recombinant chimera consisting of bovine PIV3 (BPIV3) in which the F and HN protective antigen genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3. The BPIV3 backbone provides a host-range attenuation phenotype to which each of the genes contributes. Studies have been completed in unscreened adults (N =15) and seropositive older children (N = 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1).  Minimal shedding was seen in either populations and there was no difference in illness between vaccinees and placebo recipients. Thus, the virus was safe to proceed to seronegative older children of 6 to 36 months of age (N = 30, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). 11 subjects in this study group have been enrolled. In the 6 vaccinees and 3 placebo recipients unblinded to date, the vaccine replicated to a moderate titer in most recipients and was well tolerated. (ii) The second HPIV3 candidate is rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived virus that previously had been found by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons, and the attenuating mutations were identified as described in previous reports. A new vaccine lot was manufactured by LID and is currently being evaluated by LID and Medimmune under a CRADA. LID has found that the cDNA-derived HPIV3cp45 vaccine replicates to over 7log10 TCID50/ml in Vero cells, which is promising for the purposes of manufacture. The vaccine was evaluated at a dose of 5.0 log 10 in a 2-dose, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 16-12 month old serologically-unscreened infants. 12 of the 16 infants receiving the first dose shed vaccine virus at low-to-moderate titers. Respiratory or febrile illness was observed in 40% of vaccinees and in 38% of placebo recipients. 10 of 15 vaccinated children and none of the 8 placebo recipients had a 4-fold or greater rise in virus-specific serum antibody titer. Thus, the vaccine was well-tolerated and immunogenic in young infants. Each of the 5 vaccinated children who did not respond had some level of pre-existing virus-specific antibody, which likely restricted immunogenicity of the vaccine virus. This indicates that future studies in this population should be performed with individuals who have been pre-screened to be seronegative. Following the second dose, given after a mean interval of 6 weeks, only 1 of 15 vaccinees shed vaccine virus; this individual was asymptomatic. 13% of recipients of the second dose had respiratory or febrile illness, compared to 63% of the second dose placebo group. None of the vaccinees or placebo recipients had a 4-fold rise in virus-specific serum antibody titer following the second dose. This indicates that the vaccine indeed induced protection against HPIV3 infection, and that a longer interval between doses may be needed to obtain a boosting effect. This protocol was amended to include screening to ensure that the infants are HPIV3-seronegative prior to immunzation. The age group has been expanded to include infants and children ages 6 to 36 months. In addition, nasal washes for viral assay were collected only in the case of respiratory or febrile illness. 21 additional subjects were enrolled: 14 received 2 doses of vaccine and 7 received 2 doses of placebo. Rhinorrhea was the most frequently observed illness in either group, occurring in 6/14 vaccinees and 5/7 placebo recipients following the first dose and 5/14 vaccinees and 3/7 placebo recipients following the second dose. 4-fold or greater rises in HPIV3-specific serum antibody were observed in 79% and 14% of vaccinees following the first and second dose, respectively. 86% of vaccinees had a 4-fold or greater rise following either dose. Under a separate protocol, the effect of increasing the interval between the 2 doses to 6 months will be evaluated. 40 children will be enrolled in order to have at least 30 evaluable subjects. Seattle Childrens Hospital has enrolled the first 10 subjects into this study.RSV vaccine:  Medimmune has initiated studies under the CRADA leading up to a Phase 2b proof of principle efficacy trial with a recombinant rRSV, called rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, containing a set of five independent attenuating mutations.  LID also has manufactured clinical lots of two versions of an RSV mutant in which the M2-2 gene has been deleted, in preparation for Phase 1 studies. Manufacturing is in progress for a mutant containing a deletion in the NS1 gene. HMPV vaccine: LID has submitted an IND application for a clinical lot of a live-attenuated HMPV vaccine virus (rHMPV-Pa) in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. We also are evaluating a recombinant wild type HMPV in adults in an inpatient study to characterize infectivity, shedding, symptomology, and immune responses. This wild type virus is the parent for all of our HMPV vaccine candidates, and this study will establish the suitability of this virus as the parent as well as providing an indication of its virulence.',\n",
       " \"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. The virus has spread efficiently to both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres and has been associated with over 16,000 deaths. Given the virus' recent zoonotic origin, there has been concern that the virus could acquire signature mutations associated with the enhanced pathogenicity of previous pandemic viruses or H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential. We tested the hypothesis that mutations in the polymerase PB2 gene at residues 627 and 701 would enhance virulence but found that influenza viruses containing these mutations in the context of the pandemic virus polymerase complex are attenuated in cell culture and mice. Influenza A virus (IAV) evolution is characterized by host-specific lineages, and IAVs derived in whole or in part from animal reservoirs have caused pandemics in humans. Because IAVs are known to acquire host-adaptive genome mutations, and since the PB2 gene of the 2009 H1N1 virus is of recent avian derivation, there exists concern that the pathogenicity of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic virus could be potentiated by acquisition of the host-adaptive PB2-E627K or -D701N mutations, which have been shown to enhance the virulence of other influenza viruses. We evaluated influenza viral infections in a mouse model which showed that these mutations did not increase the virulence of viruses containing the 2009 H1N1 viral polymerase. This further supports the importance of historical contingency in the development and evolution of novel influenza viruses.The 2009 H1N1 pandemic emerged even though seasonal H1N1 viruses have circulated for decades. Epidemiological evidence suggested that the current seasonal vaccine did not offer significant protection from the novel pandemic, and that people over the age of 50 might were less susceptible to infection. In a mouse challenge study with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, we evaluated protective immune responses elicited by prior infection with human and swine influenza A viruses. Mice infected with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (Mex09) showed significant weight loss and 40% mortality. Prior infection with a 1976 classical swine H1N1 virus resulted in complete protection from Mex09 challenge. Prior infection with either a 2009 or a 1940 seasonal H1N1 influenza virus provided partial protection and a >100-fold reduction in viral lung titers at day 4 post-infection. In conclusion, these findings indicated that in experimental animals recently induced immunity to 1918-derived H1N1 seasonal influenza viruses, and to a 1976 swine influenza virus, afford a degree of protection against the 2009 pandemic virus. These data have epidemiological implications suggesting partial protection of older persons during the 2009 pandemic.\",\n",

       " \"Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are significant causes of severe respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. The HPIVs are enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to subfamily Paramyxovirinae within the Paramyxoviridae family. These serotypes can be further classified as belonging to either the Respirovirus (HPIV1 and HPIV3) or Rubulavirus (HPIV2) genus and are immunologically distinct in that primary infection does not result in cross-neutralization or cross-protection. The HPIV genome encodes three nucleocapsid-associated proteins including the nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (P) and the large polymerase (L) and three envelope-associated proteins including the internal matrix protein (M) and the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) transmembrane surface glycoproteins. F and HN are the two viral neutralization antigens and are the major viral protective antigens. In addition, the P gene encodes the accessory protein(s) C (HPIV1), V (HPIV2), and C, D, and possibly V (HPIV3). The HPIVs cause respiratory tract disease ranging from mild illness, including rhinitis, pharyngitis, and otitis media, to severe disease, including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. HPIV1, HPIV2 and HPIV3 have been identified as the etiologic agents responsible for 6.0%, 3.3% and 11.5%, respectively, of hospitalizations of infants and young children for respiratory tract disease. Together these viruses account for approximately 18% of all pediatric hospitalizations due to respiratory disease. Licensed vaccines are currently not available for any of the HPIVs. The major goal of this project is to develop live attenuated vaccines against all three serotypes. Candidate vaccine viruses are recovered from cDNA using reverse genetic systems described in previous reports. This provides the means to develop well-defined live vaccines. Based on previous work, we already have multiple HPIV3 vaccines in clinical trials. Thus, this report focuses on HPIV1 and HPIV2.HPIV1: A novel HPIV1 mutant, rHPIV1-C+P, was generated in which the overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the C and P proteins were placed in separate genes to make it possible to introduce mutations into one protein without affecting the other. Infectious rHPIV1-C+P was readily recovered and replicated as efficiently as wild-type (wt) HPIV1 in vitro and in African green monkeys (AGMs). rHPIV1-C+P provided a useful backbone for recovering an attenuated P/C gene deletion mutation, (del84-85), which was previously unrecoverable, likely due to detrimental effects of the deletion on the function of the P protein. rHPIV1-C(del84-85)+P and an additional mutant, rHPIV1-C(del169-170)+P, were found to replicate to similar titers in vitro and to activate the type I IFN and apoptosis responses to a similar degree as rHPIV1-C+P. rHPIV1-C(del84-85)+P was highly attenuated in AGMs, immunogenic, and effective in protecting AGMs against challenge with wt HPIV1, and will be investigated further as a candidate HPIV1 vaccine. We further sought to understand the role of the C proteins in apoptosis. HPIV1 was modified to create rHPIV1-P(C-), a virus in which expression of the C coding sequence was silenced without affecting the amino acid sequence of the P protein. Infectious rHPIV1-P(C-) was readily recovered from cDNA, indicating that the nested set of four C proteins is not essential for virus replication. rHPIV1-P(C-) replicated in vitro as efficiently as wt HPIV1 early during infection, but its titer subsequently decreased coincident with the onset of extensive apoptosis not observed with  wt HPIV1. The apoptosis was initiated by activation of both the intrinsic (caspase 9) and extrinsic (caspase 8) pathways. Contrary to expectations, this heightened apoptosis does not appear to be the cause of the reduction in viral replication, which remains unexplained.HPIV2: In wt HPIV2, a single gene (the P/V gene) encodes both the P protein and the accessory cysteine-rich V protein. The two proteins share the same N-terminal sequence but have different C-terminal domains due to frame-shifting (called RNA editing) by the viral polymerase. In model paramyxoviruses, V inhibits the cellular interferon (IFN) response, in addition to performing other functions that are less well defined. We mutated the RNA editing signal to create an HPIV2 mutant (rHPIV2-Vko) in which the P/V gene expressed only the P protein. Loss of expression of the   V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells. The rHPIV2-Vko virus, unlike wt HPIV2, strongly induced type I IFN and permitted signaling through the IFN receptor, leading to the establishment of a robust antiviral state. rHPIV2-Vko infection induced extensive syncytia and caused dramatic cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Replication of rHPIV2-Vko was highly restricted in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LTR) of AGMs and was not detected in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that the V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in vivo and in HAE cultures in vitro. The high degree of restriction of rHPIV2-Vko in AGMs and in HAE cultures suggests that this mutant is over-attenuated and would not be suitable as a live attenuated virus vaccine, but will be useful to study the function of V during HPIV2 infection. We next characterized wt HPIV2 infection in the HAE in vitro model. We found that the virus replicates to high titer, is shed only apically, targets ciliated cells, and induces minimal cytopathology. Next, we used the HAE model to evaluate a live-attenuated vaccine candidate that was described in previous reports and is currently in clinical trials. This candidate, called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/del1724, contains both temperature sensitive (ts) and non-ts attenuating mutations and was previously found to be restricted in replication in the URT and LRT of AGMs and to be protective against wt HPIV2 challenge. This mutant was reduced in replication by more than 30-fold compared to wt HPIV2 in HAE cultures at 32C and exhibited little productive replication at 37C, reflecting a restriction of replication similar to that in the cooler URT and warmer LRT of AGMs . These data indicate that the HAE model provides a convenient experimental system for examining the cell tropism, cytotoxicity, and attenuation phenotypes of HPIV2 vaccine candidates as well as for characterizing the innate host responses of human airway epithelial tissues to infection. Since clinical trials are the only true tests of vaccine safety and efficacy, the results from this study encourage continued evaluation of this vaccine candidate in clinical trials.As noted, the N-terminal domains of the P and V proteins are encoded by the same ORF, and their C-terminal domains by overlapping ORFs. In order to manipulate either of these proteins without affecting the other, we created an HPIV2 virus in which P and V are expressed from separate genes (rHPIV2-P+V). rHPIV2-P+V replicated like HPIV2-WT in vitro and in non-human primates. HPIV2-P+V was modified by introducing two separate mutations into the V protein to create rHPIV2-L101E/L102E and rHPIV2-Delta122-127. In contrast to wt HPIV2, both mutant viruses were unable to degrade STAT2, leaving virus-infected cells susceptible to IFN. Neither mutant, nor wt HPIV2, induced significant amounts of IFN-beta in infected cells. Surprisingly, neither rHPIV2-L101E/L102E nor rHPIV2-Delta122-127 was attenuated in two species of non-human primates. This indicates that loss of HPIV2's ability to inhibit IFN signaling is insufficient to attenuate virus replication in vivo as long as IFN induction is still inhibited.\",\n",
       " \"Summary:Diarrheal diseases are the second leading single cause of death (behind pneumonia) in children under 5 years of age, accounting for approximately 15% (1.336 million) of the estimated 8.795 million deaths in this age group annually, with the greatest toll in the developing countries. Rotaviruses (RVs) have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries accounting for approximately 500,000 deaths in the under 5 year age group, mostly in developing countries. RVs are uniquely egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions. We developed an oral, live, attenuated RV vaccine in a quadrivalent formulation to protect against the four epidemiologically important serotypes (G1-4).The vaccine was comprised of representatives of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus rotavirus (RRV), a G3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and three human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing ten RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype G1, G2, or G4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the candidate vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease, the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Subsequently,in August, 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV) to Wyeth Laboratories. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception. Following additional CDC investigations, in October 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported the vaccine's link with intussusception. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Laboratories withdrew the vaccine from the market. Later data demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor in the link with intussusception. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to intussusception (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately. In addition, there are questions regarding the vaccine's actual attributable risk of intussusception, a risk estimate that has ranged widely. Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 epidemiologically-important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-Univ.of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study in Finland, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule, the BRV-TV and RRV-TV induced a high level of protection against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH collaborative study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in three different schedules, showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition, the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at two months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company (which has now been transferred to the non-profit International Medica Foundation (IMF). This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially but was revived when funding became available from the IMF. Thus,a quadrivalent RRV-TV vaccine (RotaShield) was produced by The IDT Biologika GmbH in Germany, and became available in 2009 for clinical trial. A placebo-controlled phase II safety and efficacy trial began with RotaShield in Ghana on August 28,2009 when 9 neonates were given orally the vaccine or placebo.By the end of Nov 2009 almost 1000 infants were given the 2nd dose of RotaShield or placebo:the 1st dose within the first 29 days of life and the 2nd dose before 60 days of age with a minimum interval of 3 weeks This schedule took advantage of the relatively refractory period for developing intussusception during the first 2 months of life. The study period will end at the end of November,2010 when the final participant will have reached an age within two weeks of the first birthday. The efficacy and immunogenicity results (IgA ELISA) should be available in early 2011.  In addition, efforts to implement our second generation vaccine, the human RV-bovine RV reassortant vaccine (BRV) for the developing countries have advanced. The NIH OTT initially granted licenses to develop the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions, one in the U.S. and seven in developing countries (Brazil, China and India).Three of the 8 are engaged in vaccine production and early clinical trials and one is producing pre-vaccine materials. Requests for licenses have continued with the OTT granting licenses for BRV vaccine to an additional 2 laboratories in China in 2009 and 2 in 2010 with pending requests for licenses by 4 additional labs in China. Also, one laboratory in China was granted a license to manufacture a human-porcine (Gottfried) reassortant vaccine in 2008. They are also seeking a license for the BRV vaccine also. LID serves as the unofficial reference laboratory for this program performing various functions (e.g.ranging from temperature stability, to sequence analysis, etc). We are proposing that (i) the second generation RV vaccine be comprised of 6 serotypes (G1-4, 8 and 9) as a universal vaccine or as a specifically designed vaccine for different areas of the world, (ii) that it should be given in a two-dose schedule at 0-4 and 4-8 weeks of age, which is a relatively refractory period for intussusception under natural conditions. The proposed manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its availability at low cost, which would facilitate its implementation in the developing areas of the world. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world was given an unsolicited boost, when we were notified in Oct 2006 by PATH that the Gates Foundation had approved their application with funding  ... to support the process and clinical development of the NIH bovine rotavirus vaccine through Phase 2 at two selected manufacturers; and address product development challenges relevant to all emerging manufacturers of this vaccine.  In certain countries, an alternative schedule may be adopted which takes advantage of the experience gained from observations described above and from Rotateq and Rotarix, recently licensed RV vaccines, with regard to the first dose: administer it at 6-12 weeks of age with no catch-up vaccination and the 2nd and 3rd doses at 3-4 wk intervals.\",\n",
       " 'We reported previously the first randomized study of any kind in patients with nonmetastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The study employed vaccine, the hormone nilutamide, and the combined therapy (crossover for each arm) with an endpoint of time to progression. We now report survival analyses at 6.5 years from the initiation of therapy with a median potential follow-up of 4.4 years. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive either a poxvirus-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine or nilutamide. Patients in either arm who developed increasing PSA without radiographic evidence of metastasis could cross over to receive the combined therapies. Median survival among all patients was 4.4 years from date of enrollment. Median survival exhibited a trend toward improvement for patients initially randomized to the vaccine arm (median, 5.1 versus 3.4 years; P = 0.13). Starting from the on-study date, the retrospectively determined subset of 12 patients who initially received vaccine and then later received nilutamide suggested improved survival compared with the 8 patients who began with nilutamide and subsequently were treated with vaccine (median, 6.2 versus 3.7 years; P = 0.045). A subgroup analysis of patients randomized to the vaccine arm versus the nilutamide arm showed substantial improvements in survival if at baseline patients had a Gleason score less than 7 (P = 0.033) and PSA less than 20 ng/dL (P = 0.013) or who had prior radiation therapy (P = 0.018). These data indicate that patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (D0.5) who receive vaccine before second-line hormone therapy may potentially result in improved survival compared with patients who received hormone therapy and then vaccine. These data also suggest that patients with more indolent disease may derive greater clinical benefit from vaccine alone or vaccine before second-line hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy followed by vaccine. These findings have potential implications for both the design and endpoint analysis of larger vaccine combination therapy trials. We hypothesized that a metronomic dose of IL-2 as a biological adjuvant would cause less toxicity while maintaining immunologic response. Eighteen patients with localized prostate cancer were treated in a single arm trial using previously established doses of vaccine and radiation therapy. The vaccine used was a recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to encode PSA admixed with a recombinant vaccinia encoding the costimulatory molecule B7.1, followed by booster vaccinations with a recombinant fowlpox vector expressing PSA. Patients received a total of eight planned vaccination cycles, once every 4 weeks, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given on days 1 to 4 and IL-2 at a dose of 0.6MIU/M2 given from days 8 to 21 after each vaccination. Definitive external beam radiation therapy was initiated after the third vaccination cycle. Patients were evaluated for safety and immunologic response. Toxicity and immunologic activity were compared with the previously reported regimen containing a higher dose of IL-2. Seventeen of 18 patients received all eight cycles of vaccine with IL-2. Five of eight HLA-A2+ patients evaluated had an increase in PSA-specific T cells of greater than or equal to 3-fold. Toxicities were generally mild, with only seven vaccination cycles of 140 given resulting in grade 3 toxicities possibly attributable to IL-2. Metronomic-dose IL-2 in combination with vaccine and radiation therapy is safe, can induce prostate-specific immune responses, and has immunologic activity similar to low-dose IL-2, with markedly reduced toxicities. Dr. Gulley and his colleagues in the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) and the Medical Oncology Branch (MOB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), NCI, have ongoing or recently completed the following collaborative vaccine clinical trials at the NCI Clinical Center. A Phase I/II pilot study of sequential vaccinations with rFowlpox-PSA (L155)-TRICOM (PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM) alone, or in combination with rVaccinia-PSA (L155)-TRICOM (PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM), and the role of GM-CSF, in patients with prostate cancer, MOB, CCR, NCI. This is the first trial involving the use of a vaccine for prostate cancer containing transgenes for three costimulatory molecules. The study showed evidence of significant drops in serum PSA, objective response, prolonged stable disease and survival in patients with advanced prostate cancer which correlated with immunologic responses. This trial also provided evidence for a more appropriate prostate cancer patient population for vaccine therapy trials. --A randomized Phase II trial combining vaccine therapy with PROSTVAC/TRICOM and Flutamide, vs. Flutamide alone in men with androgen insensitive non metastatic (D0.5) prostate cancer, MOB, CCR, NCI. This was the first randomized trial to combine a vaccine with this second-line hormone therapy in D0.5 prostate cancer patients. Phase I Trial of a PSA based vaccine and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody in patients with Metastatic Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer. This trial is the first clinical trial to combine an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and a vector-based vaccine in prostate cancer. --A randomized phase 2.5 study of 153Sm-EDTMP (Quadramet) with or without a PSA/TRICOM vaccine in men with androgen-insensitive metastatic prostate cancer, MOB, CCR, NCI.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To explore a unique approach for generating robust long term immune responses at both mucosal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the nonhuman primate model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we propose to utilize an attenuated rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vaccine vector developed in our laboratories for oral delivery of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) immunogen engineered as a fusion protein to include either full length coding sequence or specific domains of flagellin, the agonist for toll-like receptor (TLR)5. TLR5 is a potent activator of mucosal immune responses through activation of dendritic cells (DC), follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and M cells included within gut and oral cavity mucosal- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). As such, flagellin has proven to be a potent adjuvant for i) induction of serum and/or secretory antibody responses and for ii) induction of Th1 and Th2 responses in both systemic and mucosal tissues. This oral vaccine approach combines the advantages of a potent TLR adjuvant with a viral vector (CMV) shown to disseminate throughout the host after oral delivery/transmission and to establish a lifelong persistence in the presence of immune responses that limit viral pathogenicity at multiple sites within the host. Furthermore, our attenuated RhCMV vector has been modified by deletion of the RhCMV-encoded viral interleukin (IL)-10 gene (RhCMV IL10) that results in increased inflammation at the site of primary infection in vivo, an abrogation of the inhibition of DC maturation associated with wild type CMV infection in vitro, and attenuated viral replication for safety. Lastly, data has shown that prior immunity to human CMV (HCMV) does not preclude re-infection, implying that a CMV-based vector system may be broadly applied to a vaccine target population irrespective of pre-vaccine immunity to HCMV. We hypothesize that RhCMV IL10 vectors expressing SIV vaccine immunogens delivered orally and systemically will induce superior vaccine antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in multiple mucosal sites. Also, incorporation of TLR5 agonist adjuvant activity by fusion of flagellin sequences with vaccine antigen will further enhance both innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses and provide a novel oral mucosal vaccine approach for protection against HIV. Accordingly, immunogens (SIVmac239 Capsid) fused with full length and/or specific domains of flagellin will be constructed to generate a vaccine antigen with optimal immunogenicity for mucosal tissues and will be used for generation of candidate RhCMV IL10Capsid/flagellin vaccine vectors (Aim1). Candidate RhCMV IL10Capid/flagellin vaccines will next be tested for immunogenicity (Aim 2) in multiple mucosal and systemic tissues and for efficacy (Aim 3) in RhCMV-seronegative female rhesus macaques by vaginal SIVmac251 challenge. We propose that these novel vectors carry the potential to significantly impact HIV vaccine design.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Studies proposed in this application will provide a first investigation of a novel HIV-1 vaccine approach that incorporates a new viral vaccine vector, attenuated RhCMV IL10 that incorporates bacterial flagellin, a TLR5 agonist, as an adjuvant by generation and delivery of chimeric vaccine immunogens encoding flagellin sequences. Importantly, these studies will examine and develop a novel vaccine approach that is not previously tested in the SIVmac vaccine model, and carries the potential to significantly impact HIV vaccine design.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality every year. Vaccines that protect from influenza virus infection are available but they have to be re-formulated annually because their effectiveness is limited to seasonal strains. The high mutation rate of influenza virus, specifically the highly variable antigenic structure of the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) is at the core of this problem. The influenza virus vaccine is reliant on an antibody response to HA and vaccines are manufactured based on predictions of which strains are the most likely to circulate in a given season. These predictions can be inaccurate, leading to ineffective vaccines. Moreover, they do not account for the emergence of pandemic strains as exemplified by the H1N1  swine flu  outbreak in 2009. Annual vaccination campaigns are also costly and there is increasing resistance to vaccination in a significant segment of the population. A universal influenza virus vaccine that affords lifetime protection against seasonal and pandemic strains would be a solution to these problems. We propose a novel strategy to develop such a universal influenza virus vaccine. The strategy is based on the recent discovery of a broadly neutralizing epitope in the influenza HA. We plan to graft this epitope onto the surface of a virus-like particle (VLP) platform that is based on the insect virus Flock House virus (FHV). FHV VLPs allow presentation of foreign epitopes in a polyvalent manner and induce a potent antibody response. Chimeric FHV particles displaying the HA epitope will be structurally characterized by cryoEM and image reconstruction as well as binding assays using the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The particles will then be used to vaccinate mice and their antibody response will be characterized by ELISA and microneutralization assays. It is expected that immunized mice generate neutralizing antibodies and this will be confirmed by challenge studies with live virus. If successful, the proposed research could lead to a transformation in flu vaccination by eliminating the challenges currently associated with this endeavor.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application we propose to develop a new influenza virus vaccine that needs to be administered only once and then protects for a lifetime against all seasonal and pandemic strains. The strategy that we will use is based on a recent discovery that there is a region in the influenza hemagglutinin protein that does not mutate and can give rise to antibodies that neutralize many different influenza viruses. We will isolate this region of the hemagglutinin protein and graft it on a carrier particle that is known to induce a very potent immune response.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prostate is a mobile organ that demonstrates momentary and daily changes in position and shape that critically affect accurate delivery of radiation therapy. For this reason, in modern technically demanding radiation therapy for prostate cancer, it is standard practice to localize the prostate on most days treatment as an aid to achieve the goal of delivering a high dose to the prostate while protecting nearby radiosensitive normal tissues. The Phase I study established the feasibility of a novel approach that uses unique mathematical properties of a class of statistically trainable deformable shape models to estimate treatment image data by mapping reference CT image data into the treatment space based on measured positions of markers implanted in the prostate. The estimated images capture the pose, position and shape of the prostate during treatment and are suitable for accurate calculation of dose delivered to the prostate and immediately surrounding tissues. The first two years of this Phase II study will focus on design and development of a clinical prototype system based on this creative technology. The prototype will be evaluated in the clinical setting during the third year. The envisioned commercial form will accept input data from multiple devices including the treatment planning system, treatment machine, and marker tracking system, and will communicate output data to the treatment planning system. Within a few seconds the proposed prototype will use input data to automatically compute the estimated treatment image and calculate delivered dose. The proposed system will leverage work accomplished under a currently active Phase II project (R44 CA119571) that will allow the prototype to be used with intra-treatment imaging devices as well as marker-trackers. Moreover the proposed approach may enable a form of dose computation, called synchronized dynamic dose reconstruction, needed for the most accurate form of ART.

This contribution is especially significant in light of a series of recent mistreatments that have led many to believe that new planning and delivery technologies have outpaced the development of clinically practical methods to independently validate safe planning and delivery.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease and death in humans. H5N1 is spreading rapidly in bird populations world-wide and there is great concern that this virus will begin to transmit between people and cause a global pandemic catastrophe. Vaccines are the cornerstone strategy for combating avian flu but there are complex challenges facing us today including, (1) the inability to manufacture the vast numbers of safe and effective doses needed to prevent infection on a world-wide scale; (2) the fact that the current vaccines are ineffective and require large doses, and (3), virus strains are continually changing, which complicates vaccine strain selection. TRIA Bioscience Corp. is developing a novel adjuvanted vaccine for pandemic H5N1 Flu that should solve many of the scientific and technological barriers confronting this field. The vaccine antigen is recombinant H5 haemagglutinin (rH5), which uses a production process that simplifies many of the manufacturing issues associated with conventional vaccines, and the adjuvant (GLA-SE) that combines two clinically-validated strategies for augmenting vaccine performance, a synthetic Toll-Like Receptor-4 agonist, GLA, and an oil-in-water emulsion, SE. We are building on our compelling Phase I SBIR data by proposing activities leading up through an IND. First, we will compare GLA-SE activity against two simpler GLA-formulations designed to streamline adjuvant development and regulatory approval. Second, we will establish vaccine protection in ferret challenge models and establish safety and immunogenicity end-points in non-human primates. Third, we will manufacture and release cGMP-grade H5 protein and adjuvant, and obtain FDA clearance for a Phase I clinical trial. The results from this study will provide a relevant measure of dose sparing for vaccine manufacturers and inform clinicians about a new tool for inducing broad immunity against drifted strains of H5N1 virus. The US and world governments are investing billions of dollars in pandemic preparedness measures and TRIA will be well-positioned to participate in this market. This vaccine's design is broadly applicable to other infectious diseases, which increases its commercial potential even further.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is great international concern that the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus will cause a pandemic infection resulting in millions of deaths. We are developing an adjuvanted vaccine with new technologies that will streamline manufacturing constraints and prevent H5N1 infection on a global scale.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8+ T-cell T-cells can be a central role in immune control of HIV infection. However, the CD8+ T-cell responses that should be induced by an HIV vaccine in order to be optimally effective are yet to be established. Work we have done in the course of the previous 5 years of this grant have focused on the southern African HIV epidemic, the region worst affected by HIV and most urgently in need of an effective vaccine.   One major conclusion that can be drawn from the work we have done in the past 5 years of this grant is that immune control of HIV infection is facilitated by a broad Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell response, in particular by responses in Gag, but also to a lesser extent in Pol, that can drive selection pressure on the virus. It is apparent that some of the most efficacious responses are subdominant to other, ineffective responses. Epitope efficacy differs between proteins (Gag>Pol>Acc-Reg>Env), but also within proteins. Epitope efficacy also differs acording to HLA restriction. HLA-B-restricted responses have the greatest impact on viral setpoint, and drive the strongest selection pressure on the virus. HLA-C-restricted responses are associated with high viral setpoint even when they are Gag-specific.   The goal of the first specific aim of these proposed studies is, using a novel approach to achieve rapid definition of CTL epitopes, to identify those responses, including subdominant responses, in Gag and Pol that are most effective in inhibition of HIV replication. It is quite clear that current knowledge of the optimal epitopes targeted, and the CD8+ T-cell response hierarchy even for the most prevalent HLA alleles, remains inadequate in order to understand the CD8+ T-cell response in natural HIV infection and what perturbations of this response hierarchy may be needed to optimise the CD8+ T-cell contribution to immune control of HIV. For an allele such as A*6802, present in 1/6 of the southern African population, currently described optimal epitopes account for only 1% of the actual responses made by A*6802-positive subjects that are restricted by that alelle. The novel approach, involved use of peptide-MHC tetramers, is rapid and inexpensive, has been validated by us as shown in preliminary data presented, and crucially provides the further opportunity to assess the efficacy of purified antigenic-specific cells in viral inhibition assays.   The second aim of these studies is to investigate the ability of a T-cell vaccine in humans to alter the response hierarchy observed in natural infection. We will study the South African subjects who were vaccinated with the MRK Ad5 vaccine (HVTN 503, 'Phambili' study), which expressed Gag, Pol and Nef. Using our database of 1,015 south African study subjects in whom we have characterized the CD8+ T-cell responses against C clade infection, using a panel of 410 overlapping 18mer peptides, we will be able to determine whether this MRK Ad5 T-cell vaccine, which has already been shown to boost specifically Gag, Pol and Nef responses in post-infection vaccinees, can alter the response hierarchy that is seen in non-vaccinated infected people. This would be an important prerequisite for a T-cell vaccine to be effective.   The final specific aim of these proposed studies is to investigate the impact of viral adaptation to the CD8+ T-cell response hierarchy. We have shown in the previous 5 years' work that viral adaptation is occurring at a population level, such that escape mutants in even the most protective epitopes are accumulating over time. How fast, and the extent to which, these escape mutants accumulate will be considered in these proposed studioes, to determine whether viral adaptation in fact is likely to have an impact on current T-cell vaccine design.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD8+ T-cell responses play an important part in successful immune control of HIV infection. However, it remains unclear what T-cell responses need to be induced by a vaccine in order to optimise immune control of HIV in post-infection vaccines. These proposed studies, focusing on the HIV epidemic in southern Africa, aim to use a novel approach to rapidly define and characterize epitopes in Gag and Pol which, if induced by a vaccine, might be expected to improve immune control significantly, compared to HLA matched individuals with natural HIV infection. In the second part of the studies, we will study the T cell responses of South Africans who became infected having received the MRK Ad 5 T-cell vaccine, to determine whether this vaccine, which expressed Gag, Pol and Nef, had been able in selected study subjects to alter the CD8+ T-cell response hierarchy. Finally, we aim to address the impact of viral adaptation on the CD8+ T-cell response hierarchy, in order to determine whether viral adaptation which is detectable, is sufficiently rapid and extensive to affect the epitopes that currently are most successful at inhibition of viral replication.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myeloid lineage cells (macrophage/microglia) are central to the ability of primate lentiviruses (HIV/SIV) to establish a viral reservoir in the central nervous system (CNS) and the presence of such a reservoir underscores the neuropathogenic manifestations of virus infection. However, beyond their role in CNS infection, it is not known whether monocyte/macrophage are even necessary for infection of the host by HIV/SIV and definitive experiments demonstrating such an essential role are lacking. Our studies on HIV- myeloid cell interaction have revealed the existence of viral determinants that specifically operate in monocyte/macrophage. These determinants are essential for the ability of the virus to invade the cell and for the ability of the virus to maintain a persistent infection. Based on this, we hypothesize that myeloid cells are essential for infection of the host and propose that strategies that truncate myeloid cell infection will fundamentally impact the course of infection by curtailing viral persistence, neuroinvasion and pathogenicity. To pursue this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Examine the in vivo phenotype (replication, persistence, neuroinvasion) of SIV mutants incapable of infecting myeloid lineage cells. Our research has defined a viral determinant (Vpr/Vpx) that is essential for the infection of myeloid cells by HIV/SIV yet that is dispensable for infection of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Infection of macaques with these mutants will allow us to define how the myeloid cell reservoir shapes the course of viral replication, persistence and pathogenicity in vivo. Aim 2: Evaluate the contribution of myeloid reservoirs to chronic virus infection through the use of pharmacologic agents that truncate infected macrophage survival. Our research has established a mechanism by which monocyte/macrophage resist viral cytopathic effects that relies on the production and signaling of the survival cytokine monocyte colony stimulating factor (MCSF) by infected macrophage. We have determined that agents that interfere with the function of the MCSF receptor restore the sensitivity of macrophage to virus-mediated cytopathicity. We will examine whether pharmacologic inhibition of survival cytokine signaling curtails viral persistence in the macrophage phase of SHIVDH12 infection in macaques. Aim 3: Define the cellular factors that regulate myeloid cell infection by primate lentiviruses. Antiviral restrictions such as Apobec 3G and Tetherin have generated intense interest in the field. Our research reveals the existence of a novel antiviral factor that is specifically expressed by myeloid cells. This restriction potently inhibits myeloid cell infection by HIV/SIV and the viral Vpr/Vpx proteins counteract the antiviral activity of this restriction. We will use biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize the cellular activity that regulates myeloid cell infection. Studies outlined in this proposal will define the role of the myeloid cell reservoir in the biology of primate lentiviruses and in the interaction of primate lentiviruses with their hosts. This information will be used to devise strategies with which to prevent the establishment of HIV-1 infection in the host as well as strategies to curtail the chronic nature of virus infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research over the past several years has highlighted that mammalian cells are not passive to infection by primate lentiviruses such as HIV-1. Rather, some proteins within mammalian cells potently antagonize the replication of primate lentiviruses. As a consequence, primate lentiviruses have evolved counter defenses in order to circumvent these  cellular restrictions . We have evidence for the existence of a novel cellular restriction that is specifically expressed by myeloid lineage cells such as macrophages. In this project we propose to identify the nature of the cellular restriction, the mechanism by which it antagonizes primate lentivirus replication and the role it plays in the establishment of myeloid cell reservoirs in vivo. Information gathered from this study will reveal new drug targets with which to prevent the establishment of myeloid cell reservoirs by primate lentiviruses thereby truncating the ability of these viruses to persist within the host. )',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With rising rates of opioid addiction, inadequate opioid addiction treatment is increasingly problematic. Buprenorphine treatment can address this problem by reducing opioid use and HIV risk behaviors. Marginalized populations at high risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, like injection drug users (IDUs), have limited access to buprenorphine treatment. Because of minimal regulations, buprenorphine treatment can be integrated into community-based settings where IDUs congregate. There is great potential for strategies that emphasize community-based buprenorphine treatment to reach marginalized populations, like IDUs.  Building on our previous work in which we developed community-based strategies to improve access to HIV treatment and developed a buprenorphine induction strategy to overcome induction challenges, we believe that developing a buprenorphine treatment intervention in community-based settings is critical to improving accessible and successful opioid addiction treatment for IDUs. Thus, we propose to develop a buprenorphine treatment intervention in non-medical community-based settings to improve access to opioid addiction treatment, improve health outcomes, and reduce high-risk behaviors among IDUs.  We will collaborate with two community-based organizations (CBOs) to develop, test the feasibility of, and preliminarily examine a community-based buprenorphine treatment (CBBT) intervention. We anticipate that the CBBT intervention will consist of: buprenorphine education, facilitated access to physicians, support during buprenorphine induction, and support during buprenorphine maintenance. Additionally, we anticipate that the CBBT intervention will target clients of the CBOs' syringe exchange programs, be implemented by CBOs' outreach workers, and occur in the CBOs' settings. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will conduct focus groups and open-ended individual interviews with two CBOs' staff and clients to guide development of CBBT intervention components, materials, and processes. 2) To test the feasibility of implementing a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will examine feasibility by: 1) monitoring outreach workers' ability to adhere to the intervention manual; 2) measuring outreach worker and client satisfaction, and 3) tracking clients who engage in the CBBT intervention. 3) To examine treatment outcomes (opioid use, HIV risk behaviors, treatment retention) of a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will compare change in opioid use and HIV risk behaviors before and 30 days after initiating buprenorphine treatment in clients who received the CBBT intervention with clients who did not. We will also compare 30-day treatment retention.  If CBBT is feasible and can improve treatment outcomes, it could positively impact the opioid and HIV epidemics. Pilot data from this project will guide our R01 grant application, to conduct a large-scale rigorous study of the effectiveness of our CBBT intervention.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With increasing rates of opioid addiction, our innovative project will develop, test the feasibility of, and preliminarily examine treatment outcomes of a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to improve access to opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine and improve buprenorphine treatment outcomes (reduce opioid use, reduce HIV risk behaviors, and improve retention in buprenorphine treatment). This study's findings will be used to guide a large-scale study of our community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on development of an effective vaccine for filovirus infection, which is an etiologic agent of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever and can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat of an epidemic outbreak. We have studied the development of VLP vaccines against virus infection, and have shown that EBOV VLPs produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system, which gives high VLP production yield, exhibit DC-stimulating activity and induce strong antibody responses that neutralize EBOV GP mediated virus infection, indicating that such VLPs could be safe and effective vaccines to induce protective immunity against EBOV infection. We also found that immunization with a mixture of DNA and VLP vaccines (DNA/VLP) induced higher levels of both antibody and cellular immune responses in comparison to immunization with either alone. We hypothesize that the novel DNA/VLP vaccine will elicit strong cellular and antibody responses against filovirus infection and that the employment of a new vaccine delivery technology will further augment induction of such responses, with the aim to obtain a vaccine strategy that can confer rapid and long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 1. To improve the immunogenicity of DNA and VLP vaccines for eliciting more potent and durable protective immunity against pan-filovirus infection. We will explore different strategies to modify filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity for inducing both antibody and T cell responses as well as their production yield and will determine the immune responses that contribute to and are critical for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the microneedle (MN) technology for filovirus vaccine delivery. We will develop the technology to encapsulate filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines into bio-absorbable MNs and investigate the biological property, stability, and immunogenicity of encapsulated vaccines and investigate different geometrical designs and chemical formulations to further improve the MN vaccine delivery technology for achieving more efficient and reproducible vaccine encapsulation, and improved vaccine stability. Specific Aim 3. To compare the protective efficacy of different vaccine approaches and determine the immune correlates for protection against filovirus infection. We will compare immune responses induced by different vaccine formulations using both conventional intramuscular injection as well as the novel MN vaccine delivery technology and evaluate their protective efficacy against lethal filovirus challenge in small laboratory animal models as well as non-human primates and will determine the correlates of immune responses that are important for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. The results will set the foundation for selection of the most effective candidate vaccine strategy for GMP production and human trials. The successful development of this vaccine strategy may also be readily applied to vaccines against other viral hemorrhagic fevers which still lack effective vaccines.    Public Health Relevance: Filoviruses are etiologic agents that cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers and can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat to public health. We have recently demonstrated the combined benefit of two non-viral-vector based vaccine platforms and its potential for the development of an efficacious vaccine against EBOV infection. In this project we will further develop the novel DNA/VLP vaccine strategy for eliciting strong cellular and antibody responses against EBOV infection and develop a new vaccine delivery technology to further augment induction of such responses.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious disorder associated with significant psychiatric and medical morbidity and mortality and high treatment costs due to the use of intensive treatment. Evidence suggests that FBT for adolescent AN is an effective outpatient treatment both at the end of treatment and 4-5 year follow-up. Using FBT, about 50% of participants remit (%IBW>95 + EDE >1SD of the mean) and 90% of those fully remitted at post-treatment, remain so at 12-month follow-up. In contrast, 75% of those not fully remitted at post-treatment are still not remitted at follow-up. Because there are no known effective treatments for adults with AN, and adolescents with AN appear to be more responsive to treatment, efforts to improve outcomes in this age group are critical to prevent the development of a chronic and unremitting course. However, when response to FBT is inadequate, more intensive programmed treatment (e.g. day treatment, residential care, or psychiatric hospitalization) is often recommended. Despite the common use of such programs, available data do not suggest that these interventions are more effective than outpatient interventions in adolescents. An alternative strategy to improve outcomes for those that do not respond to FBT would be to provide additional and targeted outpatient help directly to families themselves. Data suggest that families that are not likely to be successful in FBT can be identified as early as one month into treatment. Consequently, providing an alternative therapy early in the treatment course may enhance overall outcome. To develop a new treatment - Intensive Family-Focused Treatment (IFT) to improve outcomes in those who do not show an early response to FBT we propose a 2-phase treatment development study which aims to (1) identify modifiable family factors/behaviors that interfere with accomplishing weight restoration, and (2) develop a new family treatment (IFT) targeting unhelpful behaviors and promoting helpful ones (Phase 1 - Iterative case series (n=40)), and (3) pilot IFT (for those not responding early to FBT) vs. FBT alone in a small RCT, and (4) explore familial and individual factors as predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment (Phase 2 - Small RCT (n=50)). To achieve these aims, this study will recruit 90 adolescents with AN (DSM-IV, exclusive of amenorrhea) and their families at two sites (45 participants at The University of Chicago and 45 at Stanford University). Primary outcome will be full remission from AN (%IBW>95 + EDE >1SD of the mean). Assessment of primary outcome as well as potential predictors, moderators and mediators will occur at baseline and at the end of treatment and will include eating related psychopathology in the parent and child (Eating Disorder Examination), Yale- Brown-Cornell-Eating Disorder, height/weight, general psychopathology in parent and child, family status, and family functioning.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate compared to any other psychiatric disorder. The most promising treatment for adolescents with AN is family-based treatment (FBT). However, only 50% of patients receiving FBT fully remit at 12-moth follow-up. Consequently, providing an alternative therapy early in the treatment course for those not responding to FBT may enhance overall outcome. This study aims to develop a new treatment - Intensive Family-Focused Treatment (IFT) - to improve outcomes in those adolescents, aged 12-18 years, who do not show an early response to FBT.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is based on recent experimental results with paired congenic and transgenic strains of mice with divergent missing-self MHC-I Dk recognition of murine CMV infected cells to examine the role of NK cells in virus infected animals. The broad long-term objective for the research project seeks to understand inhibitory receptor signaling in NK cells and the impact on the NK cell's ability to rapidly respond to and kill virus infected cells. An interesting question raised by the research proposal is whether NK inhibitory receptor recognition of virus infection simply permits activation receptor signals in NK cells or directly activates a signal cascade in NK cells needed in efficient effector responses and viral resistance. This distinction is important since NK cells have a profound effect on other immune cells, including the priming of virus-specific T cell effectors. A guiding hypothesis in the research proposal is that NK inhibitory receptor recognition of virus infection delivers a potent signal which permits or 'activates' rapid NK responses to immediately provide protection against further infection and begin to cultivate other immune cells needed to prime adaptive immune responses. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. will determine the effect of inhibitory receptor signaling and missing-self MHC class I recognition of virus infection in NK cell-mediated resistance and enhancement of adaptive viral immunity. We will test the hypothesis that an inhibitory receptor is required in missing-self MHC-I Dk recognition of MCMV infected cells in Ly49G-null mice. Proposed experiments will examine the effect of Ly49G2 deficiency on innate virus resistance, priming of virus-specific T cell effectors, viral persistence and mortality. Aim 2. will assess the effect of inhibitory receptor signaling and missing-self recognition of virus infected target cells on membrane proximal signaling events in NK cells and identify key NK cell expression differences, which may be causally linked with innate virus resistance. We will investigate Ly49G2 inhibitory receptor signaling in the context of virus infection and the hypothesis that missing-self recognition of MHC-I Dk infected cells permits or activates a potent signal, marked by distinct biochemical changes in NK cells, to promote NK cell responsiveness. Aim 3. will perform refined genetic mapping, identification and characterization of non-MHC loci that enhance inhibitory receptor expression on NK cells and NK cell-mediated virus resistance. We will test the hypothesis that modifiers of Ly49G2 receptor expression and MCMV resistance determine how NK cells respond to infection, their capacity to recognize infected cells and consequently their impact on adaptive immunity. Relevance NK cells are vital to human health. They protect against malignancy and virus infection. NK cells recognize and respond to many different types of viruses. However, some viruses are able to evade NK cell detection (e.g. herpesviruses) and others (e.g. HIV) are able to outlast, outwit or defeat NK cells. Thus, it is critical to understand how NK cells recognize virus infected cells in the body. Recent advances in this field have remarkable promise since we know now that NK cells can use activation receptors that directly recognize virus infected cells and therefore target NK cell killing adequately. However, NK cells with activation receptors cannot restrain all virus infections. Despite this, NK cells use inhibitory receptors also to recognize and respond to viral infection. Unfortunately, an established model to investigate the effect of NK inhibitory receptors in viral infections was not available before. Our laboratory has succeeded in generating such an innovative model and this research proposal will use it to investigate the impact of NK cell inhibitory receptors and their contribution to antiviral NK cell effector functions.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human semen contains cationic amyloid fibrils, termed the  Semen Enhancer of Virus Infection  (SEVI), which strongly enhance HIV-1 infection and may play an important role in viral transmission. Our preliminary data show that amyloid-binding molecules bind to SEVI, and block semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. This suggests that (i) SEVI is responsible for semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection and (ii) SEVI represents a novel microbicide target. We therefore propose to explore a novel, innovative approach to HIV-1 microbicide development, using agents that selectively target SEVI. This high-risk/high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target the virus itself, and is expected to be highly complementary with direct antiviral approaches. Indeed, our long-term goal is to use SEVI-targeting agents in combination with traditional microbicides, to achieve optimal antiviral effectiveness.  In the R21 phase, we will test whether novel amyloid-binding small molecules inhibit semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. The feasibility of this approach has been established using two amyloid-binding small molecules which contain  shielding  oligo-ethylene glycol (EG) moieties: BTA-EG4 and -EG6. These agents efficiently inhibit SEVI- and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. In Aim 1, we will generate and test novel derivatives of these and other amyloid-binding molecules, including oligovalent molecules that are expected to possess increased SEVI binding affinity. We will then test their ability to inhibit SEVI- and semen- mediated enhancement of HIV infection using a panel of R5 virus strains (including different clades and transmitted strains). In Aim 2, we will examine the interaction between novel amyloid-binding small molecules and cells from the female reproductive tract. We will evaluate whether our compounds are toxic to human cervicovaginal epithelial cells (HCEC), and we will test whether they inhibit SEVI-enhanced binding of HIV-1 to HCEC and/or SEVI-enhanced trans-infection of PBMC by HCEC exposed to HIV-1 virions.  The R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved. In Aim 3, we will use structure-activity relationship (SAR) data to refine our chemical compositions. We will also test whether our lead molecules have efficacy in a cervical explant model for HIV-1 infection, and whether they have a synergistic or additive effect on the ability of other candidate microbicides to inhibit HIV-1 infection in the presence of semen. In the final Aim, we will assess the toxicity and inflammatory effects of the most promising candidate molecules, using beneficial Lactobacillus strains and cervical explants. The R33 phase will culminate with an evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the most promising compound in the rabbit vaginal irritation (RVI) model.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully determine whether small molecules that target SEVI have potential utility as a novel class of microbicides.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New approaches to prevent the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are urgently needed. This application seeks to develop a new class of microbicidal agents that are targeted not to the virus itself, but to a host protein found in semen that strongly enhances HIV-1 infection. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target the virus, and is expected to be highly complementary with direct antiviral approaches.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is one of the most common neurotropic pathogens in humans with a seroprevalence rate increasing up to 60-80% by the 5th decade of life. Clinical diseases associated with HSV-1 include herpetic stromal keratits, the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in the industrialized world, and frank sporadic encephalitis, a rare but debilitating disease that can result in death. Resistance to infection includes the innate immune system. Central to the innate immune response to virus infection is the type I interferon (IFN) pathway which upon activation by a variety of means including pattern recognition receptors results in the expression of potent anti-viral pathways that block virus replication at the transcriptional and translational levels. Recently, we have begun to explore the relationship between virus infection in the nervous system (peripheral and central) and the role of the type I IFN system in local host resistance and the ensuing adaptive immune response to the insult. Mice deficient in a functional type I IFN pathway (i.e., absence of the alpha chain of the type I IFN receptor, CD118-/-) are found to be highly sensitive to HSV-1 succumbing to infection within 6 days associated with an elevation in virus titer in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Moreover, there is a massive loss of cells residing in the draining lymph node associated with an increase in T cell apoptosis and necrosis. There are also notable changes in recruitment of leukocytes residing in the nervous system post infection of CD118-/- mice. Changes in leukocyte recruitment to the nervous system are reflected by specific changes in select chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL10 and CCL2 in the infected tissue. However, the contribution of resident cells (including astrocytes and microglia) versus infiltrating leukocyte populations within the nervous system or the organized lymphoid tissue (i.e., draining lymph node) in the context of a functional type I IFN pathway in response to infection and the ensuing adaptive immune response and neuropathology is unexplored. We propose to employ mice deficient in select genes as well as mouse chimeras to address this question. Preliminary, unpublished data suggest the resident cells residing in the brain stem with an intact type I IFN system are critical to control viral infection whereas in the peripheral nervous system (i.e., trigeminal ganglion) or cornea, both resident and bone marrow-derived cells with a functional type I IFN pathway are required to maximize resistance to infection. We propose two specific aims within this competitive renewal. The first aim will test the hypothesis microglia with a functional type I IFN receptor maintain resistance to HSV-1 following ocular infection. The second aim will test the hypothesis that both leukocytes and resident cells within the TG, cornea, and draining lymph node with a functional type I IFN receptor are required to maximize resistance to HSV-1 infection. It is anticipated the outcome of this project will identify key central components of innate and adaptive immunity within the CNS and peripheral tissues (including sensory ganglia and cornea) that are critical for viral surveillance unique to each tissue. In so doing, a focus on the development of vaccines that utilize (via expansion or activation) such components will provide superior efficacy compared to current strategies that utilize viral encoded proteins that typically generate an immune response incorporating only antibody production or T effector cells. Alternatively, mediators of neuropathogenesis can be targeted to alleviate collateral damage and thus, preservation of neurons in patients that suffer from acute or recurrent HSV-1 CNS or peripheral nerve infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that can lead to sporadic encephalitis or other neuropathological conditions in patients that suffer reactivation episodes. The role of the principal innate immune response associated with the control of viral replication and spread, the type I interferons (IFNs), as it relates to the reduction of CNS inflammation and development of the adaptive immune response within the nervous system will be investigated using whole animal, cellular, and molecular techniques. It is anticipated the outcome of the study will identify novel mediators of inflammation responsible for tissue destruction and neuropathology but irrelevant in the control of virus infection. Consequently, by targeting the inflammatory mediators, it may be possible to contain the severity of neuroinflammation without compromising the host ability to control virus replication and spread.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of a vaccine against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major public health priority. Of particular urgency is the need to protect newborn infants from the devastating consequences of congenital HCMV infection, including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and deafness. Recently, a subunit vaccine based on recombinant HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) showed efficacy in a clinical trial. However, it is not clear that a vaccine based on a single HCMV protein will provide robust, long-term protection, particularly for women in their childbearing years. A potential significant advantage of the live, attenuated approach to HCMV vaccines is that such vaccines could elicit an immune response that mimics natural immunity and hence provide broader protection to a wide variety of virus-encoded targets of the host immune response. However, such vaccines carry the theoretical risk of establishing latency, reactivating under conditions of immune suppression, or causing chronic HCMV-associated diseases. An approach to generate an immunogenic, yet safe live vaccine is the deletion of viral genes that subvert host defense mechanisms to infection. Using the guinea pig model of congenital CMV infection, we propose to test this approach by targeting viral genes that subvert two key host defenses: MHC I homolog genes (NK cell evasins) and protein kinase R (PKR) evasins. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated efficacy and safety of a recombinant GPCMV vaccine which had a genomic deletion of a block of MHC I homologs. We propose to identify the key viral gene involved in this attenuation and to test our hypothesis that this gene product evades host defenses by inhibition of the NK cell response (aim 1). We hypothesize this virus will demonstrate superiority immunogenicity over wild-type virus, as assessed by cytokine response, CD8+ response, and antibody titer. A recombinant virus deleted of the MHC I function, ?(MHC, will be evaluated for attenuation in animals, and immune mechanisms will be confirmed by immune assays and NK depletion studies. In the previous funding period we have also identified a GPCMV gene involved in the inactivation of PKR. We propose to characterize this and other PKR evasins (aim 2) toward the goal of generating a deletion virus incapable of inhibiting the PKR response ((PKR). We will combine PKR and MHC mutations in a single attenuated virus construct that we predict will yield a safe, highly attenuated vaccine with improved immunogenicity. Despite tight innate immune control, this (MHC/(PKR construct is hypothesized to elicit strong, long-lasting protective immunity. This concept will be further tested in the GPCMV congenital infection model by evaluating and comparing the (MHC and (MHC/(PKR vaccines (aim 3). We hypothesize these vaccines will demonstrate equal or superior protection to infection with wild-type (control) virus against congenital infection and disease. By identifying optimal attenuated vaccine strategies in the GPCMV model, the translational prospect of genetically designing a vaccine for HCMV that has strong immunogenicity and improved safety will emerge.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infectious agents can cause birth defects in newborn infants, and the most common of these infectious diseases in the United States is human cytomegalovirus (CMV). A vaccine given to a woman before pregnancy would likely prevent CMV from causing injury to the fetus and newborn infant. An attractive approach is to design a vaccine that is attenuated, meaning that the vaccine is very similar to the natural virus itself, but unable to cause disease. However, such a vaccine must be safe, so there needs to be more knowledge gained about how to modify the virus so that it is very safe, but still able to induce a strong immune response. These studies use an animal model in guinea pigs to generate this new knowledge. These studies will examine ways to engineer the CMV virus, by deleting genes that contribute to its ability to evade immune clearance, in order to design a safe vaccine that is also highly protective for the developing fetus.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a dangerous, NIH/NIAID category B human pathogen and a potential bioterrorism threat. Outbreaks of VEEV occur in Central America and have previously spread into the United States. The potentially devastating effects of the virus reemergence in the U.S. demand an effective vaccine to protect population. Currently, live attenuated TC-83 vaccine is used under IND protocol for vaccination of personnel at risk. The vaccine causes adverse effects, whereas some individuals do not develop neutralizing antibodies. The efforts to develop new VEEV vaccines are underway. However, because vaccine development is a lengthy process and the supply of TC-83 vaccine is limited, the U.S. may soon experience a shortage of VEEV vaccine, which can leave the U.S. population unprotected.  We propose a revolutionary new technology for vaccination against VEEV and potentially, other viral diseases. Medigen has recently developed the  infectious DNA  (i-DNA) vaccination technology, which represents a unique combination of conventional DNA immunization with high efficacy of live attenuated vaccines. The key feature of this technology is that live attenuated virus is launched in vivo from i-DNA plasmid carrying a molecular clone of VEEV vaccine with enhanced safety and immunogenic features. In preliminary studies we have shown that injection in vivo of the prototype i-DNA derived from the TC-83 vaccine has successfully launched live attenuated vaccine in mice. Here we propose the development and feasibility evaluation of novel i-DNA VEEV vaccine for safe and efficient vaccination against VEEV based on the rational design of i-DNA clones and i-DNA immunization technology.  In Specific Aim I, we will apply innovative  silent mutagenesis  method to introduce additional genetic changes into the prototype TC-83 i-DNA in order to secure attenuated phenotype and to generate i-DNA clones with high levels of safety and immunogenicity. The i-DNA clones will be transfected in CHO cells and live attenuated viruses will be harvested from culture media. Safety of i-DNA-derived viruses will be evaluated in mice in collaboration with the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland. In Specific Aim II we will vaccinate BALB/c mice with i-DNA constructs in order to induce immune response and to evaluate immunogenicity in vivo. Further, the efficacy of the most promising i-DNA VEEV vaccine will be evaluated in a virulent VEEV challenge experiment at Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research (SFBR), San Antonio, TX. Finally, reversion studies in vivo will be also conducted at SFBR to demonstrate genetic stability of i-DNA - derived VEEV vaccine. The goal of this 2-year research is the identification of i- DNA VEEV vaccine clone with the optimal safety and immunogenicity profiles for future evaluation and challenge experiments in non-human primates.  Our preliminary results suggest that the rational vaccine design and i-DNA technology can provide a revolutionary solution for VEEV vaccine by improving safety, genetic stability, and immunogenicity, and by eliminating many costly steps of the conventional manufacturing process. Essentially, live attenuated vaccine will be  manufactured  within the immunized individuals. This technology also utilizes many advantages of DNA vaccines (genetic homogeneity and stability, low cost of manufacturing, storage, and transportation, no cold chain) and, more importantly, enhances immunogenicity. Recombinant i-DNA clones produced in bacteria contains CpG motifs that activate TLR9 and MyD88-dependent signaling pathways resulting in robust production of cyto- and chemokines, which induce strong priming effects and stimulate acquired virus- specific immune responses.  The final i-DNA VEEV vaccine will represent a novel class of vaccines combining the advantages of DNA and live attenuated vaccines and preserving the backbone of a  classic  vaccine with a history of human use. The i-DNA technology can be easily adapted for the development of other vaccines including live attenuated vaccines for WEEV, EEEV, other alphaviruses, and flaviviruses. If successful, this technology can potentially transform the field of live attenuated vaccines for many viral diseases.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this application, we propose the development of a revolutionary new technology for vaccination against VEEV by using the  infectious DNA  (i-DNA), a unique hybrid of DNA and live attenuated vaccines. The key feature of this technology is that live attenuated vaccine virus is launched in vivo from i-DNA plasmid. In this study, we will generate several i-DNA vaccines and evaluate their safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy against virulent VEEV challenge in experimental mouse models. If successful, this technology can potentially transform the field of live attenuated vaccines for many viral diseases.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The earliest events following mucosal HIV-1 exposure represent a critical window of opportunity for vaccine-elicited immune responses to impact the acquisition and propagation of HlV-1 infection. However, opportunities to elucidate these early immunologic and virologic events in humans are extremely limited. Modeling these events in nonhuman primates will therefore likely be instrumental in the design and development of next generation HIV-1 vaccine strategies. Such studies will provide critical insights into the early events of virus transmission and the capacity of vaccine-elicited immune responses to block or to attenuate these events. In this Consortium, we have assembled many the of world's foremost experts in nonhuman primate research and HIV-1 vaccine development to analyze the virology and immunology of early SIV/SHIV infection in rhesus monkeys as well as to determine the mechanism by which cutting-edge vaccine approaches afford protection in these models. These studies will allow a detailed interrogation of the ability of different types of immune responses to intercept the virus and to control early infection. We hypothesize that certain vaccines and immunologic interventions will be able to attenuate or even abrogate the early events following mucosal SIV/SHIV infection, including the initial local amplification of virus at the mucosal portal of entry as well as the subsequent trajectory of virus spread that leads to systemic dissemination. During the proposed five year project period, we will explore in detail the mechanism of protection afforded by adenovirus vectors and poxvirus vectors (Barouch, Project 1), cytomegalovirus vectors (Picker, Project 2), live attenuated SIV (Johnson, Project 3), neutralizing antibodies (Burton, Project 4), and adeno-associated virus-mediated antibody delivery (Desrosiers, Project 5). These Projects will receive extensive support from the Administrative/Biostatistics (Barouch/Johnson, Core A), Pathology (Haase, Core B), Immunology (Johnson/Burton, Core C), Virology (Shaw/Lifson, Core D), Systems Biology (Sekaly, Core E), and Nonhuman Primate (Axthelm/Mansfield, Core F) core facilities.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The earliest events of mucosal HIV-1 infection in humans remain largely undefined, given the short duration and asymptomatic nature of the eclipse phase of HIV-1 infection. An improved understanding of the earliest events following mucosal SIV/SHIV infection of rhesus monkeys will yield insights into critical viral vulnerabilities during the transmission process that can be exploited by vaccine-elicited immune responses. Such knowledge will lead to the development of improved next generation HlV-1 vaccine strategies.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes the mosquito-borne disease yellow fever (YF), a viscerotropic disease, i.e., it targets the liver, of primates. The disease is controlled by a very efficacious live attenuated vaccine, strain 17D, which was derived from wild-type strain Asibi and has been administered to over 540 million people in the last 70 years. In the last 10 years a rare, but fatal, condition has been reported due to the vaccine, termed YF vaccine associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). This condition is associated with uncontrolled replication of the virus in primary vaccinees resulting in pansystemic infection and a disease picture very similar to wild-type YFV. Originally, YEL-AVD was reported to have an incidence of 0.3 per 100,000 vaccinees. However, in October 2007, an incidence of 9 per 100,000 was reported in Peru. This alarming rate of serious adverse events is causing regulatory authorities to re-evaluate the contraindications and use of the 17D vaccine, and a number of individuals are calling for the development of a new YF vaccine. Nonetheless, it is recognized that development of a new vaccine takes at least 15 years. Thus, there is an urgent need to undertake research on the current vaccine to understand YEL-AVD and how the current vaccine could be improved. This urgency is emphasized by the use of 17D vaccine virus to generate chimeric viruses containing the structural protein genes of one flavivirus (e.g. Japanese encephalitis) in a 17D vaccine virus backbone. Such chimeric vaccines are in phase II clinical trials. Surprisingly, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the virulence of wild-type YFV or the attenuation and immunogenicity of the live- attenuated YFV 17D vaccine. This is, in part, due to the lack of a small animal of viscerotropism. The PI has developed a new YFV infection model that readily distinguishes wild-type Asibi strain from the 17D vaccine strain. Our long-term goals are to use this model to understand the immunologic basis of viscerotropism and attenuation. Our specific aims are: i) investigate the steps in the pathogenic sequence at which attenuated 17D virus infection is blocked compared with virulent Asibi virus thereby identifying potential anomalies in the innate immune response that might be important to the development of YEL-AVD; and ii) identify YFV-encoded molecular determinants of viscerotropism present in YEL-AVD isolates by examining their viscerotropic phenotype in the new mouse model developed in this project.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The highly-lethal viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the mosquito-borne yellow fever virus (YFV) was one of the most feared diseases in Africa, Europe and the Americas until the live-attenuated 17D vaccine was developed in the 1930's. Even today, over 200,000 West Africans contract YF annually, with tens of thousands of fatalities. The attenuated 17D vaccine strain was derived by repeatedly growing a wild- type YFV isolate (strain Asibi) in cultured cells. Although 17D is considered to be one of the most effective live-attenuated virus vaccines ever developed, the immunologic mechanisms that control the attenuation and immunogenicity of this live-attenuated vaccine remain a mystery. Our long-term goal is to determine how the host is able to control the 17D infection and investigate mechanisms by which vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) occurs. To achieve this goal, Drs. Ryman and Barrett have proposed a consortium agreement in which Dr. Barrett's laboratory will provide viruses to Dr. Ryman's laboratory, where their virulence will be assessed using a newly developed model of YFV pathogenesis and disease. Our understanding of host- pathogen interactions has increased sufficiently to allow rational design of live- attenuated virus strains and the technology exists to introduce and test mutations in genetically-engineered vector systems. It is anticipated that our findings will improve the safety and efficacy of the YFV vaccine, and additionally facilitate the rational design of other live-attenuated virus vaccines, particularly against other pathogenic flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile and dengue viruses) and the closely-related alphaviruses (e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus), most of which are agents of both emerging infectious disease and bioterrorism/biowarfare.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposal is to provide proof of concept evidence that a newly-developed prototype laser system can result in dose-sparing of existing influenza (flu) vaccines without any additives. Flu continues to be a significant public health problem and is responsible for up to 3~5 million cases of severe disease and 500,000 deaths a year worldwide. It costs more than 4 billion dollars a year in the US alone. Annual vaccination still remains one of the most cost-effective means to prevent the spread of the virus and decrease flu-caused morbidity and mortality, which, however, creates a huge burden economically, clinically and manufacturally. That is because time of a new vaccine matching the antigen alteration in the circulating virus is relatively short and yet the vaccine demand is massive and continuously increasing drastically every year, in particular, during an outbreak of a new strain or pandemic of flu virus. Vaccine adjuvant can significantly reduce vaccine doses or dosages, reducing the cost enormously. Unfortunately, aluminum-based adjuvant, the only FDA-approved, widely used vaccine adjuvant in the US, failed to provide satisfactory augmentation of immune responses for flu vaccines in humans. We develop a prototype laser system capable of enhancing and prolonging immune responses against protein-based vaccines including season flu vaccine with few side effects. We are exploring this laser vaccine adjuvant (LVA) for dose- sparing of existing seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines. We will investigate whether immune protection elicited by a low dosage of season flu vaccine intradermally or intramuscularly injected into a site of laser exposure is equal to or greater than that induced by a higher dosage of the vaccine injected similarly in Balb/c and C57BL/6 (B6) mice and in minipigs to verify the feasibility of this technology in different animal species with varying skins. A similar study will also be conducted in old and young mice to corroborate that LVA can reduce vaccination doses from two to one in naive young mice and significantly enhance a respondent rate of flu vaccination in old mice. Finally, we will extend the investigation to H5N1 pandemic flu vaccine, protecting mice and ferrets from a lethal challenge of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 flu virus after one dose of the stockpiled H5N1 vaccine delivered via a combination of LVA and MF59 adjuvant. The laser  adjuvant  does not need cold chain storage or any modification to the existing vaccines, and it can be used immediately and repeatedly without a limit. These unique characters make this technology ideal for coping with flu vaccine shortages.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brief illumination of the skin with a safe laser before vaccination may result in dose-sparing of existing influenza vaccines, leading to cost-effective savings in billions of dollars each year for seasonal flu vaccines, and higher vaccine availability in the event of an influenza pandemic.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 180 million people worldwide, causing acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, however, no protective vaccine is available and only a subset of infected patients respond to the current treatment of interferon (IFN) plus ribavirin. Statistics predict that without improved therapeutics one million people in the US will suffer from HCV-related cirrhosis by 2020. Mathematical modeling of HCV RNA levels in the serum of chronically infected patients during interferon therapy has increased our understanding of HCV infection dynamics and treatment response kinetics, and is playing an important role in the analysis of clinical data. Nevertheless, the absence of infectious cell culture systems has impeded full understanding of HCV infection and the mechanistic basis of response to therapy. Fortunately, significant advances were made recently with the identification of a genotype 2a HCV consensus clone (JFH-1) that we and others have shown can replicate and produce infectious HCV in vitro. Hence, for the first time, we can efficiently propagate HCV and study the entire viral lifecycle and the effects of potential antiviral on the infection process. The ability to study HCV in vitro provides an unprecedented cross disciplinary opportunity to increase our knowledge of HCV by quantifying HCV infection kinetics and formulate mathematical models of HCV infection and treatment response at the molecular level. A more quantitative understanding of intracellular and extracellular HCV infection and treatment dynamics will help define rate limiting steps required for infection, identify effective antiviral targets and define the mechanism of action (MOA) of antivirals that are under development thus facilitating the design of improved therapeutics. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Quantify HCV infection kinetics in vitro and develop new mathematical models to elucidate processes that regulate HCV dynamics from initiation to steady state. 2) Validate and refine our understanding of HCV replication and infection by characterizing HCV inhibition during treatment with antiviral agents of known MOA and then determining if our mathematical models accurately predict those empirically measured inhibition dynamics. 3) Use HCV mathematical models to predict the MOA by which clinically relevant drugs inhibit HCV and empirically test those hypotheses.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 180 million people worldwide, causing acute and chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, however no protective vaccine is available and only a subset of infected patients respond to current treatment options. To design more effective antivirals it is crucial to study the HCV lifecycle to understand the dynamics of infection and identify which steps of infection represent effective antiviral targets. As such, we propose a collaborative effort between virologists and mathematicians to develop and utilize mathematical models to elucidate the biological processes that regulate HCV infection and determine viral response to treatment.',\n",

With suboptimal HIV treatment and poorly controlled HIV infection, drug users have great potential to transmit HIV infection to their partners, leading to serious public health consequences. Few studies test interventions to improve outcomes among HIV-infected drug users, and many focus on improving HAART adherence. In active drug users, these interventions, which improve adherence but do not affect drug use, lead to modest, if any, improvement in viral load (VL) suppression. In drug users, achieving and maintaining clinically significant VL suppression without addressing drug use is unlikely. Despite this, we are not aware of any study that has examined whether an intervention that aims to reduce drug use improves HIV-related outcomes. Because abstinence-reinforcing contingency management (CM) overwhelmingly reduces drug use, and reduction in drug use is associated with improved HIV outcomes, the benefits of abstinence-reinforcing CM are likely to extend to improving HIV treatment outcomes. However, this has not been studied. Our study will be among the first to test whether CM that reinforces one behavior (achieving abstinence) leads to improved outcomes in other related behaviors (achieving VL suppression). We propose to test whether an abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention improves VL suppression in HIV-infected drug users. We will enroll 202 participants with suboptimal drug and HIV treatment (using cocaine or opioids while receiving opioid agonist treatment, with detectable VL while prescribed HAART) to test a 16-week intervention of abstinence-reinforcing CM on VL suppression. Participants will be randomized to the abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention or performance feedback (control condition). The CM group can earn $1320 based on drug-free urine. Participants will be followed for 28 weeks, and data sources will include blood and urine tests, questionnaires, and pill counts. The primary outcome will be change in VL, and secondary outcomes include CD4 count, abstinence, and HAART adherence. Our study aims are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on VL suppression, and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving VL suppression with our abstinence-reinforcing CM intervention. We hypothesize that those randomized to the CM (vs. control) group will have greater VL suppression, and that the CM group will have greater abstinence, leading to higher adherence, leading to greater VL suppression. Our proposal is innovative and responsive to RFA DA-11-001. It is well-established that abstinence-reinforcing CM reduces drug use, and reduction in drug use is associated with improvements in HIV treatment. What is not known, and what this study will elucidate, is whether abstinence-reinforcing CM is efficacious in improving VL suppression, and the mechanisms underlying this effect. Given the central role that CM is now playing in large public health trials, our findings will have substantial public health implications.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected drug users have poor HIV treatment outcomes. Of the few studies that test interventions to improve outcomes among HIV-infected drug users, many focus on improving HIV medication adherence. In active drug users, these interventions, which improve adherence but do not affect drug use, lead to modest, if any, improvement in HIV viral load suppression. Because abstinence-reinforcing contingency management (monetary vouchers contingent on abstinence from drugs) overwhelmingly reduces drug use, and reduction in drug use is associated with improved HIV outcomes, the benefits of abstinence-reinforcing contingency management are likely to extend to improving HIV treatment outcomes. However, this has not been studied. Our study will be among the first to test whether contingency management that reinforces one behavior (achieving abstinence) leads to improved outcomes in other related behaviors (achieving HIV viral load suppression). Specifically, in a randomized controlled trial, we propose to test whether an abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention improves viral load suppression in HIV-infected drug users. Given the central role that contingency management is now playing in large public health trials, our findings will have substantial public health implications',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection causes human bone marrow failure by destroying the bone marrow resident erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which support autonomous replication of the virus. In patients with a high demand for erythrocyte production due to high levels of erythrocyte destruction (e.g., sickle-cell disease patients), acute B19V infection can cause transient aplastic crisis. In immunocompromised patients, persistent B19V infection may manifest as pure red-cell aplasia. In the fetus, B19V infection can cause hydrops fetalis, a severe form of anemia. B19V infection induces damage of EPCs, which results in the above bone marrow failures. B19V-infected EPCs undergo cell death with clear apoptotic features. This cell death is induced mainly by high expression of the non-structural 11kDa protein (11kDa) during infection, and involves a caspase cascade triggered by caspase-10. In the proposed research, we aim, firstly, to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying caspase-10- mediated apoptosis in response to 11kDa. To this end, we will determine which apoptotic pathway the extrinsic or the intrinsic activates the initiator caspase-10 during B19V infection-induced apoptosis. As both the apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways play key roles in erythropoiesis and the homeostasis of EPCs, we propose to identify the cellular proteins that interact 11kDa and transduce the apoptotic signal in EPCs. Secondly, having recently established a B19V culture system that mimics native B19V infection of human EPCs in bone marrow under hypoxic conditions, we will carry out high throughput screening (HTS) of a library of small molecules (available at the University of Kansas HTS Core Laboratory; contains over 100,000 druglike small compounds) for anti-B19V infection drug candidates. The B19V culture system can generate virus in sufficient quantity for such screening, and the cell death marker can be readily applied to assess B19V infection as a readout. We will use a cell-based luminescent cytotoxicity assay to screen the library. Because B19V vaccine is currently unavailable, and immunocompromised patients would be unable to respond to a vaccine, there are currently no viable treatment options for diminishing the bone marrow failure caused by B19V infection in patients with acute or persistent B19V infection. The study proposed in this application is expected to identify targets for the development of drugs capable of eliminating B19V from human EPCs, and this will ultimately lead to diminished bone marrow failures in these patients. In addition, our analysis of the mechanism underlying apoptosis of EPCs is expected to reveal pathways that may be involved in erythropoiesis or the disruption of erythropoiesis under certain disease conditions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human parvovirus B19 is pathogenic to humans, causes bone marrow failure in some severe circumstances. Study of B19 infection-induced cell death will help us to understand the mechanism of B19 caused bone marrow failure in general. Our proposed work will thus answer critical questions in the pathogenesis of parvovirus B19 infection, and have the potential to identify candidates of anti-B19 drugs for treating B19 infection-caused bone marrow failure.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled   Glutamatergic Mediators of Antidepressant Response in Major Depression . The candidate has a background in the clinical management of mood disorders and training in clinical trial methodology and is currently the  Associate Director for Translational Neuroscience Research in the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at McLean  Hospital. The current proposal is designed to enable the candidate to gain experience and training in the use of  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as an in vivo neuroimaging tool to be used adjunctively with clinical  trials to measure neurochemical changes associated with treatment. In doing so, the candidate hopes to be  able to identify mediators of treatment response to standard and novel treatments for mood disorders and to  better understand the mechanisms of action of these treatments. Through the proposed research, interactions with mentors and consultants, and didactic coursework, the candidate seeks to obtain specialized training and  experience in: 1) advanced clinical trial methodology and biostatistics; 2) MRS techniques and their  applications to clinical psychiatric research; 3) principles of neurochemistry; and 4) the responsible conduct of  research. Exposure to the large neuroscience research community at McLean as well as access to a large  clinical population at McLean and unlimited access to the McLean Brain Imaging Center provides the  candidate with the ideal environment to carry out this work. This training will foster the candidate's development into an independent clinical investigator using MRS to elucidate the mechanism of action of mood  disorder treatments with a focus on the identification of potential neurochemical biomarkers of treatment  response.   The proposed research uses a novel MRS technique, J-resolved proton MRS, to measure acute and  chronic changes in brain levels of glutamate and glutamine in depressed patients with major depressive  disorder (MDD) following treatment with citalopram while simultaneously assessing depressive symptoms as  measured by the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Specifically, the candidate proposes to treat 25 depressed MDD patients with citalopram 20-60 mg daily for a period of 6 weeks. During the course of the study, the candidate will perform a total of 4 MRS scans occurring at: 1) baseline; 2) day 3 of treatment; 3)  day 7 of treatment; and 4) week 6 of treatment. Clinical assessments will be performed weekly during the course of the study. The primary aim is to test the hypothesis that citalopram treatment is associated with an increase in the glutamine/glutamate ratio (Gln/Glu), an index of glutamatergic neurotransmitter activity, in the  anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) from baseline to day 3 of treatment. The secondary aim is to test the  hypothesis that citalopram treatment is associated with an increase in the Gln/Glu ratio in the ACC from  baseline to day 7 of treatment. Exploratory aims will investigate whether: 1) citalopram treatment is associated  with no change in the Gln/Glu ratio in the ACC from baseline to week 6 of treatment; 2) change in the Gln/Glu  ratio in the ACC from baseline to day 3 is positively associated with improvement in depressive symptoms at  week 6; 3) change in the Gln/Glu ratio in the ACC from baseline to day 7 is positively associated with  improvement in depression symptoms at week 6; and 4) the Gln/Glu ratio at baseline is positively associated  with improvement in depressive symptoms at week 6. In doing so, the candidate hopes to identify early  changes in glutamatergic activity following citalopram treatment that may mediate clinical response.   MDD is a common and often debilitating disorder. Despite this, a significant fraction of MDD patients do not  respond to currently available treatments and many others must endure multiple medication trials before an  effective treatment can be identified. The proposed project would have major significance for several reasons.  First, it will further elucidate the mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and  perhaps other standard antidepressant medications, facilitating the future development of novel MDD  treatments. Second, if early changes in the Gln/Glu ratio are shown to mediate clinical response, this evidence  would support further investigation of the Gln/Glu ratio as a biomarker that may predict treatment response to  citalopram, and perhaps other antidepressant treatments. Given the time presently required for an adequate  trial of existing antidepressants, and the frequent need for multiple trials to achieve response, it would be a  major advance to find a biomarker able to predict clinical response early in the treatment of MDD. Third, this  study will likely provide additional insights into the role of glutamatergic dysfunction in mood disorders,  expanding scientific knowledge of the pathophysiology and potential treatment of MDD.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic, and debilitating mental illness that represents a  significant public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanism of action of currently available  antidepressant treatments is limited making it difficult to develop newer, more effective, treatments. This study  will use a novel neuroimaging technique to investigate whether treatment with the antidepressant citalopram is  associated with acute changes in the neurotransmitter glutamate in individuals with MDD and whether these  changes are associated with clinical response.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents the most common viral infection transmitted in-utero and is a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The rate of congenital HCMV infection ranges from 0.2-1.0% of live births in the US and exceeds 1% in many parts of the world. Although maternal infection during pregnancy (primary maternal infection) represents a significant risk for virus transmission to the fetus and disease, infection and transmission to the fetus in women with existing immunity to this virus (non-primary maternal infection) is frequent. Disease in babies infected following non-primary maternal infection is well documented. Worldwide, including most US populations, the disease burden in infected infants born to women with non-primary infections exceeds that of offspring of women with primary maternal infection. In this proposal we will explore two mechanisms of non-primary maternal infections, reinfection with new strain of viruses and recurrence/reactivation of a persistent infection. Our goals are to define virological characteristics of non-primary infections and parameters of HCMV specific immunity in a highly seroimmune population in which non-primary maternal infections account for the vast majority of infected babies. We will also determine the incidence of the most common long term sequelae of congenital HCMV infection, hearing loss, in infected babies. We anticipate these studies will help identify host responses associated with intrauterine transmission and damaging fetal infections in this population of women with non-primary infection and could aid in the rationale development of effective prophylactic and possibly therapeutic vaccines to limit the morbidity from this congenital infection.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will investigate the characteristics of human cytomegalovirus infection in a population of women in which over 98% have immunity to this virus. Even in the presence of immunity, these women still transmit virus to their developing offspring and about 10% of infected babies develop hearing loss, the most common sequelae of this congenital infection. Current vaccine strategies will not prevent this type of congenital infection and in almost every part of the world, including the US, infected infants born to immune mothers represent the largest contribution to the overall disease burden of this infection. Our goals are to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for transmission of virus in these immune women in order to more rationally design strategies that could prevent infection of the developing fetus with this virus.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. There is no approved vaccine despite decades of effort. Early attempts to develop a formalin- inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) resulted in disease enhancement following environmental exposure to RSV. Efforts to develop recombinant subunit vaccines have met with limited success due to poor immunogenicity and short-lived responses. Over the last few years, several avenues of study have suggested that the adverse inflammatory responses associated with RSV infection, and perhaps the failure of the FI-RSV vaccine, are linked to the RSV-G protein which plays a critical role in virus attachment to target cells. RSV-G contains a CX3C chemokine motif that interacts with the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor and appears to elicit an inflammatory Th2-biased immune response that contributes to disease pathogenesis. We have shown that antibody responses to the CX3C motif can reduce virus infectivity, inhibit RSV-G chemokine-modulating activity and reduce lung inflammation following infection. Vaccine designs that elicit an IFN response may also help to reduce the Th2-biased response and lung inflammation associated with RSV infection. In this Phase I project, we will use an innovative approach to produce synthetic nanoparticle vaccines carrying the RSV-G peptide coupled with RSV T-cell target antigens that favor IFN responses. Nanoparticles will be fabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of oppositely charged polypeptides, including designed peptides (DP) carrying the antigen payload, to build ultrathin films on solid nano-sized cores. We have shown that vaccines made by this strategy improve the immunogenicity of both T-cell and antibody target epitopes without triggering adverse inflammatory reactions. The current proposal will (1) identify the optimal DP designs for increasing loading and stability of nanoparticles, (2) select LbL nanoparticle vaccine designs based on potency and phenotype of antibody and T-cell responses induced (with particular emphasis on IFN responses that have been shown to improve protection from RSV disease), and (3) test the biological activity of antibody responses in assays measuring virus and chemokine neutralization, inhibition of chemotaxis, and protection of mice from viral burden and lung inflammation following challenge with RSV. The RSV-G DP will include a CD4 T-cell epitope that overlaps the chemokine motif, and will be complemented by addition of T-cell target epitopes from RSV-M2 or RSV-F to provide additional IFN modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance. Thus, the novel nanoparticle vaccines produced in this study will have the capacity to elicit multiple mechanisms of protection against RSV infection and aberrant lung inflammation. The deliverable of this project is one or more LbL RSV-G vaccine candidates with demonstrated safety and efficacy in animal models; these candidates will be further developed in a subsequent Phase II project that will complete the steps necessary for Investigational New Drug application filing and eventual clinical testing. The application of this innovative approach to RSV vaccine development will also impact vaccine development for other infectious diseases.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use an innovative nanoparticle technology to produce novel vaccine candidates for respiratory syncytial virus. Since the vaccines contain a portion of the virus responsible for both infection and host inflammation, vaccine-induced immune responses will not only reduce the rate of RSV infectivity but will also alleviate the lung inflammation associated with RSV disease. A vaccine emerging from this effort will address a large unmet need in infants, children, elderly and immunocompromised patients.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Improved strategies and approaches are urgently needed to more effectively prevent and treat recurrent infections in AIDS. Following primary infection, a chronic life-long T. gondii infection characterized by the presence of persisting cysts containing slowly or nonreplicating bradyzoite parasite forms is established in CNS/brain. Reactivated infection due to cyst rupture during immune suppression causes a difficult to treat and life-threatening Toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS. Currently, no vaccine is approved for use in humans to prevent infection and drug treatments for acute infection are suboptimal. Eradicating pre-existing cysts and chronic infection is an excellent approach to control/prevent infection in AIDS. However, no current treatment is effective at eradicating pre-existing cysts and chronic infection. Lack of progress in targeting cyst stages can be attributed to major gaps in our knowledge of parasite biology underlying cyst development and maintenance of chronic infection. Recent progress in understanding the complex host-parasite interaction has revealed that many rhoptry bulb (ROP) proteins appear to be central players in host cell manipulation due to their secretion into the host cell at invasion and their subsequent localization to host cell cytosol/nucleus or their intimate association with the parasitophorous vacuole. Host cell manipulation by these secreted ROP proteins is likely to be critical to the success of parasite biology necessary for acute and chronic infection in vivo. The parasitophorous vacuole appears to be critical for replication of tachyzoites as well as being central to the development of the cyst wall and tissue cyst that characterize chronic infection. We hypothesize that a family of ~ 34 secreted ROP proteins possessing homology to kinases (the  ROP kinome ) are outstanding candidates as potential targets to disrupt virulence, cyst development, or chronic infection. Here, we propose to delete each predicted gene member of the secreted ROP kinome in type II T. gondii, and to then ascertain any defect in acute virulence, in early cyst development, or in chronic infection. Using a directed functional genetic approach, this work will identify specific members of the secreted ROP kinome that participate in critical functions required for establishing or maintaining chronic infection in vivo. This project will identify and validate specific secreted ROP kinases as key targets for preventing acute or chronic infection. This project will also develop essential tools and methods required for the future undertaking of larger scale higher throughput knockout and functional genomic projects in type II T. gondii. Consequently, this innovative project has high overall impact by advancing genetic models for dissection of type II biology, by revealing new aspects of host-parasite interaction, and by exposing new targets to prevent or eradicate chronic infection.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will identify specialized parasite proteins that are essential for the ability of Toxoplasma gondii to establish and maintain a chronic infection. No vaccine is currently available to prevent infection and no drug treatment is available that can eradicate chronic infection. By functional analysis of a family of specialized parasite proteins we expect to identify new targets to prevent or eradicate chronic infection. The information gained in this project helps to uncovering fundamental knowledge of how a parasite manipulates mammalian cells and the mammalian host, and will thus uncover new approaches to eradicate a significant parasite of humans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The WHO estimates that 1.7 million people died of tuberculosis (TB) in 2009 and that 22% of those deaths occurred in people with HIV. HIV infection drove the 80% increase in TB cases in sub-Saharan over the last decade; the number of deaths and cases of drug resistance has also increased markedly.1 TB treatment's duration - at least 6-8 months for drug-sensitive disease - makes it challenging to complete in low-income countries. Research shows that intermittent or shortened TB therapy in patients with HIV leads to poor outcomes.2 A reliable marker of treatment response could improve clinical decision-making, identifying patients likely to fail early and minimizing the development of drug resistance. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, it could speed the development of more potent drug combinations that would shorten therapy. Both advances are critical to the control of the HIV and TB co-epidemics. A simple test to assess TB treatment response is urgently needed. The Cepheid GeneXpert nucleic acid amplification system may serve this purpose. It has been shown to be accurate for TB diagnosis in low-income settings, but its role in the assessment of TB treatment response has not yet been explored.3 The GeneXpert (GX) is a fully automated, self-contained device that offers a simple way to quantify the amount Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA in a sputum specimen by targeting the rpoB gene for amplification with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Therefore, we propose to evaluate the use of GX-based QPCR to assess TB treatment response. Our overall hypothesis is that differences in the rate of MTB DNA clearance from sputum will predict sputum culture status after 2 months of treatment. To test this hypothesis, we will first describe the changes over time in sputum MTB DNA quantity, measured by GX-based QPCR, in a small group of HIV-positive patients with pulmonary TB (Specific Aim 1). Using this descriptive data, we will conduct an analysis to determine the three (3) time points at which measurements must be made in order to accurately represent quantitative DNA changes. The purpose is to find the most efficient sampling method. Finally, we will measure sputum MTB DNA by QPCR with the more limited sampling method in a larger group of patients in order to identify the group of patients with a greater likelihood of positive cultures after two months of treatment (Specific Aim 2). These are the first steps in defining the utility of this new test for assessing TB treatment response; they will lead directly to additional studies to evaluate its predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes. The proposed research fits squarely within NIAID's stated mission to support the  discovery, development, and optimization of therapies and treatment strategies for HIV infection and its complications and co-infections.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of death among people with HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Two major problems facing TB treatment are that it takes 6-8 months to complete, even with drug- sensitive disease, and treatment completion does not rule out the possibility of recurrence. TB drug trials seek to identify more potent drug regimens that could shorten treatment duration and, thereby, increase treatment completion and success; but they are inefficient because they must follow study subjects for so long. A simple, accessible test to accurately assess response early in the course of TB treatment would speed up clinical decision-making by months to years, while at the same time helping researchers shorten drug trials and bring new, more powerful drugs to market faster. This project proposes a preliminary study to evaluate a new test of TB treatment response.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza epidemics exact a formidable toll on world health. Last year, the emergence of a novel influenza A H1N1 viral strain created a pandemic, producing illness around the globe. Additionally, the related avian influenza A viral strain, H5N1, represents a potentially catastrophic global health risk. Like all viruses, influenza A virus exploits host factors to replicate. To defend against this exploitation, the host mobilizes factors to confront the virus. A distinct class of protein signaling molecules, the interferons (IFNs), orchestrates a large component of this anti-viral response at both a cellular and organismal level. IFN stimulation results in over 2000 gene products being differentially regulated after IFN stimulation. To find host-cell modifiers of influenza A H1N1 viral infection, we completed a large scale genetic screen and detected several proteins which are important in decreasing influenza A virus infection, including a role for interferon-inducible trans-membrane protein 3 (IFITM3). The loss of IFITM3 resulted in elevated viral replication in multiple cell lines tested, and proved to be critical for IFN-induced viral resistance, accounting for 50% to 80% of IFN's protective ability. IFITM3 belongs to a family of four closely related proteins in humans, and five proteins in mice. This application aims to elucidate the role of the IFITM proteins in the host response to influenza A virus infection. Successful achievement of the aims of this proposal will provide in depth knowledge of the actions of the IFITM proteins and will inform us more fully on the innate interferon response to viruses. Relevance to Public Health: Influenza A virus is a threat to world health. Our previous studies have shown that the IFITM proteins play an important role in blocking influenza A virus infection. We are studying how IFITM3 decreases influenza A virus infection, and trying to find ways to use this knowledge to inhibit viral infections.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza A virus is a single stranded RNA virus that creates epidemics of respiratory illness. The studies proposed here will determine the molecular mechanism underlying IFITM3's ability to block influenza A virus infection, and identify proteins that partner with IFITM3 to stop viral infection. This work will improve our understanding of how the IFITM proteins inhibit the replication of influenza A virus and will likely provide insight into how to stop and possibly treat influenza A virus infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an important need for screening methods that can detect and distinguish the relative eye discomfort or  sting  potential of cosmetic, personal care, or pharmaceutical formulations early in their developmental stages. The only currently reliable method available is costly and sometimes painful human clinical eye testing, in which test substances are introduced into human eyes and test subjects report perceived discomfort or stinging. While this may be a critical final clinical test for an ocular product, products in development and formulation stages must also be screened in the same human clinical test, as there are no other available screening options. Available ocular irritation testing can indicate that a product or formulation is  non-irritating , which is a good start. However, current ocular irritation tests are not very predictive of eye sting. Laden (1973) has reported that formulations which had low irritancy often still caused stinging. Hence, the stinging potential of a formulation was often unrelated to irritancy. Van Abbe (1973) has also reported ocular irritancy to be a poor predictor of human reported eye stinging, pain, and discomfort. We hypothesize that this disconnect between measurable irritation and sting potential is due to lack of sensitivity in current irritation tests. Current tests use non-sensitive endpoints such as lack of corneal opacity (i.e. rabbit tests and BCOP) and substantial tissue-wide cell death (i.e. EpiOcular ). EpiOcular  (MatTek Corp, Ashland, MA) is an industry standard ocular irritation test with relatively high sensitivity. EpiOcular   tissues are exposed to test substances and then tissue viability is measured by reduction of a metabolic indicator. Extraction and subsequent measurement of the colorimetric indicator from the entire tissue is the endpoint for overall tissue irritation/cytotoxicity effects. Once the EpiOcular tissues reach 100% viability compared to the negative control tissues (no measurable tissue death), the tissues can no longer be indicative of potential sub-irritation cell death that may be an ocular sting indicator. The Porcine Cornea Confocal Assay, PorFocal, developed by MB Research, likely has the amplified sensitivity to potentially predict human eye sting due to measurement of individual cell death per tissue volume by confocal microscopy. The PorFocal uses waste porcine corneas from the meat industry to assay individual corneal cell death with high sensitivity due to a confocal microscopy endpoint. In PorFocal, test substances are placed directly onto living corneal tissue in culture; therefore solubility of the test substance is irrelevant. PorFocal cultured corneas are maintained in a living state for up to 7 days and are dosed daily with the test substance. This multiple-exposure dosing schedule allows for quantification of extremely mild ocular cell death with additive effects over time. These additive effects are then measured by quantification of individual stained dead cells within the corneal tissue by confocal microscopy. Corneal tissue is imaged in an  optical histological  manner where a series of image  slices  are acquired at increasing depths into the corneal tissue. The images can then be digitally reconstructed to exhibit the entire corneal tissue volume imaged (see Research Strategy). Therefore, extremely low amounts of corneal damage can be quantified because the endpoint is actual individual dead cell number per tissue volume. In Aim 1 seven test substances will be tested in both the EpiOcular   and the PorFocal to determine if the PorFocal assay is more sensitive than the EpiOcular  , the most sensitive in vitro ocular irritation assay (industry standard). This will test the hypothesis that sting is not detected in current in vitro assays due to lack of sensitivity. If PorFocal demonstrates higher sensitivity than the industry standard EpiOcular  , then it may have great potential to predict sting. In Aim 2, commercially available products that are known non-stingers or stingers will be tested in both EpiOcular   and PorFocal. The EpiOcular  will be used to establish whether  stingers  would be considered  non-irritants  by industry standards. If PorFocal can resolve stingers from non-irritants, this may allow for prospective culling of stinging product formulations before final human clinical eye sting testing. Upon further characterization of PorFocal, this test could significantly reduce human test subject pain and distress, and cost/time expenditure during product development and formulation.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will test the use of a cultured porcine cornea assay as a highly sensitive pre-clinical screen test to predict human eye-sting potential. A human eye sting screening test is needed for testing during product formulation and development phases, thus allowing for further culling of stinging product formulations before final human clinical eye sting testing. This would reduce overall product development cost and human test subject pain and distress while promoting robust product safety for public health.',\n",

Women of childbearing age lack antibody that will interact with the HA of the pandemic strain and neutralize it, and thus they lack measurable protection against this influenza virus. Pregnant women are at an increased risk for the complications of influenza. This risk is likely to increase for pregnant women that are also infected with HIV-1, especially if their HIV infection is poorly controlled, most feasible approach to mitigate potential complications from the pandemic strain in these women is to administer a safe and immunogenic vaccine prepared against this strain. Seasonal influenza vaccines have been efficacious in HIV-1 infected patients in the past, although they have not been sufficiently evaluated in a pregnant cohort.TIV vaccination of HIV-infected individuals before HAART has been associated with transient increases in HIV viral load in 4-18% of individuals. This may be related to T cell activation, and/or down regulation of cell-mediated immunity. Increases in HIV viral load are less common in individuals on antiretrovirals (ART), with CD4+ counts of 200-500 cells/ml at vaccination, and generally are not considered clinically significant.  Other vaccines, including tetanus toxoid, reportedly have similar adverse effects in HIV-infected individuals. These effects do not constitute a contraindication to vaccination, but it is important to establish the magnitude of the problem or the lack thereof when studying immunization of HIV-infected pregnant women, because of the high association between the maternal HIV viral load and HIV vertical transmission.In an ongoing study at the University of Colorado Denver and The Childrens Human Immunodeficiency Program comparing immune responses to seasonal influenza vaccines in HIV-1 infected and uninfected pregnant women showed that HIV-1 infected pregnant women had significant antibody increases in response to seasonal influenza vaccines. We, therefore, surmise that HIV-1 infected pregnant women may produce specific antibodies in response to the administration of the pandemic inactivated swine-origin H1N1 influenza vaccine. However, we anticipate the antibodies will be of lower titer than uninfected non-pregnant populations.  Both HIV-1 infected and pregnant women are risk factors for having lower immune defenses.The study team anticipates widespread infection with swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus during the study.  Therefore, it is imperative that this study be completed as soon as possible.  It is critical that this study evaluates a vaccine dose that is most likely to produce a high titer protective response in this high risk population.  Since women of childbearing age have had no prior exposure to the pandemic strain of influenza it will be necessary to immunize with two doses of the vaccine. This study will assess the safety and immune response following each of the two doses of inactivated swine-origin H1N1 influenza vaccine. A higher titer dose vaccine (30mcg) will be evaluated, since the target populations are at risk for sub-optimal responses to the lower dose of vaccine.  Time constraints and available subject sample size will not support a dose-ranging study. It is also likely that in this population the risk-benefit ratio supports use of the higher dose of vaccine.  Data are not currently available on either dose of the inactivated swine-origin H1N1 influenza vaccine; however, in view of prior influenza vaccine studies in pregnant women suggesting lower response rates and HIV-1 infected individuals having confirmed lower responses, we feel it is justified to use the higher titer dose.  If any data becomes available to indicate if a dose of 30mcg is not optimal, we will consider amending the protocol to evaluate another dose.Safety is being evaluated prior to mass vaccination to be certain that inactivated swine-origin H1N1 influenza vaccine is safe in HIV-1 infected pregnant women. Efficacy evaluation is not a primary objective of this protocol. HAI antibody responses will be evaluated as the magnitude of these responses has been correlated (in uninfected and non-pregnant vaccines that received seasonal influenza vaccines) with protection against influenza infection and/or disease. The immunologic assessment will focus on: 1)\\tThe number of vaccines achieving a predefined protective level (1:40 in the HAI assay as established per seasonal influenza vaccine).2)\\tInduction of specific B and T cell-mediated immunity (CMI).  3)\\tPersistence of these responses.Influenza-specific memory B cells are evaluated because they are key elements for antibody persistence. HIV-1 infected individuals with or without HAART tends to produce lower titers of specific antibodies in response to vaccines and also lose specific antibodies faster than HIV-1 uninfected individuals. The pathogenesis of the antibody loss is incompletely understood, but is related to a defect in the generation of memory B cells. Cell-mediated immunity is being evaluated because it may play a large role in recovery from influenza infection, and this response to a novel vaccine may be especially problematic in HIV-1 infected pregnant women. Furthermore, with a virus that may predominantly replicate in the lower respiratory tract, it is important to verify that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are being generated by the vaccine, because animal models have clearly established an association between influenza-specific CTL and clearance of influenza viruses from the lungs. P1086 will include immunologic measurements at 3 months and 6 months (in a subgroup of subjects) after delivery, thereby providing an evaluation of the persistence of immune responses.Transplacental antibody transfer and persistence of maternal antibodies in the infant are measured at delivery (cord blood) and 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Transplacental antibody transfer may be impaired in HIV-1 infected women by low production of specific antibodies in response to the vaccine and by their high titer of nonspecific IgG, which competes for the IgG transport sites in the placenta. Hence, it is extremely important to determine the level of transplacental influenza-specific IgG transfer to the infant and persistence of this antibody during the first 6 months of life. During these first 6 months, infants cannot be vaccinated with the seasonal TIV vaccine, nor is antiviral prophylaxis generally recommended due to lack of safety data. Antiviral prophylaxis in the younger age group may be considered, however, under special circumstances. Thus, to inform this decision we will determine the extent to which infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers receive potential passive protection as a result of their mothers having been immunized with an inactivated swine-origin H1N1 influenza vaccine.\",\n",

While reports to date suggest that healthy individuals typically have a mild illness, underlying medical conditions including immunodeficiency appear to increase risk for severe disease and even death with pandemic H1N1. Thus, knowledge of the safety and immunogenicity of the Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in HIV-infected children and youth is critically important to address the health care needs of this vulnerable population.  Because seasonal influenza has been shown to cause more severe illness in HIV-infected individuals compared to that typical of age-matched uninfected people, it is likely that 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will result in significant morbidity and possibly mortality in HIV infected individuals.  Morbidity may be a direct result of the influenza virus or infection may result in secondary bacterial infections or decreased adherence to the patients antiretroviral therapy due to the severe nausea and vomiting that may occur with pandemic H1N1 illness.  Prevention of infection in this population will be critical.It is well established that seasonal influenza infection impacts children in a community before becoming widespread in adult populations.  Susceptibility to disease among young populations appears even more pronounced with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) as one third of older adults have measurable levels of serum HAI or neutralizing antibody against the 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) while young adults and children completely lack protective titers. The serologic data is consistent with the observation that the attack rate and disease severity for the virus appears to be much higher in younger populations with relative protection of those 50 years of age.Efforts are currently underway to evaluate 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine in healthy children.  However, HIV-1 infected children attend schools and participate in all the activities that typically put children at such high risk for infection with influenza.  Protection of HIV-1 infected children and youth from 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will require knowledge of safety and immunogenicity of these new products in this population.    This study will assess the safety and immune response following each of the two doses of Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in HIV-1 infected children and youth in the US and Puerto Rico.  Two doses are thought to be required because study subjects have had no prior exposure to 2009 Influenza A (H1N1). Because seasonal influenza vaccine often results in blunted response in HIV-1 infected persons, we have opted to investigate the higher dose of antigen, 30mcg, in comparison to the 15mcg dose that is currently being studied in ongoing trials of the Novartis A/H1N1 S-OIV vaccine in healthy children.  We have also opted to stratify our study population into 3 groups based on age.  The groups were selected to provide information across all age groups and with knowledge that there would be insufficient power to compare immune response across age groups.  This study is limited to HIV-1 perinatally infected children and youth.  In order to understand the mechanism of disease and protection, we will investigate the seroresponse, duration of response, and development of influenza-like illness following vaccine in this population.  We also propose investigation of the cell-mediated response to vaccine. The generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) is of particular interest, because this virus replicates better in lung tissue than seasonal influenza and CTLs are the major mediator of viral clearance in the lungs. Memory B cells to 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) will ensure that the host responds adequately to exposure to the wild type virus.In summary, 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) is likely to infect a significant proportion of HIV-1 infected children and youth if an effective vaccine is not available before infection is widespread.  Infection will likely lead to severe disease in this vulnerable population, therefore, vaccine efforts are critical.  Immunogenicity of the candidate 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine must be established in HIV-1 infected children in order to assure that this population is protected.  Lack of a protective immune response would support the need for additional measures to protect this high risk population.\",\n",

Our secondary objective is to develop effective and safe vaccine approaches to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children. We propose that basic immune and physiologic mechanisms for respiratory virus pathobiology in the lung can only be elucidated using an in vivo animal model of infection. Although rodent models have been developed for respiratory virus infection, this species does not effectively duplicate the postnatal development of both lung and immune systems in primates. Our goal is to develop an experimental animal model of human respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus infection using the rhesus macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta). Towards this end, the first step is to optimize the susceptibility of rhesus monkeys to human respiratory virus infection. We hypothesize that the development of a respiratory infection model that demonstrates human clinical symptoms will require in vitro passaging of human viral isolates in rhesus cells to obtain robust viral replication in monkey airways.\",\n",

In contrast, CMV infection in those without a functional immune system is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. This includes CMV infections in those co infected with HIV.  Therefore, CMV vaccine strategies developed will have direct clinical relevance to protecting those most at risk for CMV disease, including HIV AIDS patients.Since human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was first recognized as a threat to the developing fetus, there have been repeated calls for a vaccine that could protect from the damaging effects of HCMV infection in those at risk for HCMV disease. The long quest for a HCMV vaccine that could prevent congenital infection and fetal sequelae, as well as end- organ disease in immune compromised individuals, remains unfulfilled. The primary objective measure for evaluating the efficiency of any vaccine is whether protective levels of immunity are generated and sustained in the vaccinees. An important issue for HCMV is the definition of what constitutes protective immunity. Using a stringent threshold, an immune response can be considered protective only if the vaccinees are absolutely protected from infection following repeated exposure to virus. Alternatively, a vaccine could still be considered protective if the course of challenge virus infection was so dramatically altered that the potential for transmission (horizontal and vertical) and pathogenesis of challenge virus was essentially eliminated. The difference between the two involves the level of virus replication at the primary site of challenge and the extent of dissemination beyond. The former definition requires the generation and maintenance of sterilizing immunity with no spread of the virus. The latter does not, but it does require that the immune system maintain a lifelong restriction on replication of a virus with a complex natural history of persistence in immune competent hosts. The hypothesis is presented that immunization against CMV can generate protective immune responses, although the degree of protection (sterilizing versus limited dissemination) will be dependent on both the titer of challenge virus and the frequency of exposure. According to this hypothesis, immunization can protect completely against infrequent exposure to a low titer CMV challenge. Protection will become more variable as the titer and/or the frequency of exposure to challenge virus increases. Vaccination should shift the virus-host balance decidedly in favor of the host such that both reactivation and shedding are significantly diminished. The hypothesis will be tested in the rhesus macaque model of HCMV infection through the following Aims. (I) Genetic immunization of seronegative macaques with plasmid expression vectors for RhCMV gB, pp65, and IE1, followed by immunization with formalin-inactivated virus. (II) Subcutaneous challenge of vaccinees and controls by experimental inoculation with either high or low titers of RhCMV. (III) Immunization of macaques followed by challenge of vaccinees and controls by natural routes with natural titers of RhCMV by co-housing vaccinees with seropositive, virus-excreting macaques. (IV) Alterations of RhCMV gene expression patterns to induce novel protective immune responses. A CMV vaccine can be considered protective if it results in a dead-end infection. This proposal will stringently test whether a combination of genetic immunization and formalin-inactivated virus can effectively eliminate horizontal spread of RhCMV following either experimental or natural infection.\",\n",

The Total Cost listed for the subproject likelyrepresents the estimated amount of Center infrastructure utilized by the subproject,not direct funding provided by the NCRR grant to the subproject or subproject staff.The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that arthropod-expectorated proteins modulate the establishment and course of arboviral infections in the vertebrate host. Our working hypothesis is that dissemination of dengue virus to the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes modifies protein expression in the salivary glands and the expectorated saliva, thereby enhancing the transmissibility of the virus to people.This hypothesis is based on the requirement that dengue virus must disseminate into the salivary glands in order to be transmitted by the primary mosquito vector, Ae. aegypti [1] and that mosquito saliva can alter the local environment at the bite site in a way that encourages the establishment of an infection[2]. We infer then that some salivary components, injected into the vertebrate upon feeding, modulate the dengue infection in the human host. Our preliminary findings suggest that dengue infection alters the protein profile of the mosquito salivary glands. The sequencing and identification of these proteins and their possible roles in transmission remains to be investigated. Dengue virus has been shown to bind Ae. aegypti salivary gland and midgut proteins [3-4] and that there is at least one dengue virus receptor in these tissues [5]. However, whether there are virus binding proteins in the expectorated saliva, which could assist in the chaperoning of virus to target cells for the establishment of infection, has not been investigated. The saliva of mosquitoes contains a diverse cocktail of pharmacologically active compounds that are deposited simultaneously with virus to the bite site of the vertebrate host [6]. Some of these are responsible for the disruption of the homeostasis of human lymphocytes [7-8] and dendritic cells [9] in addition to eliciting saliva-specific antibody production [10]. How such cytokine modulation and preexisting antibodies to salivary proteins affect transmission of dengue from the vector to the vertebrate remains to be studied. We propose to investigate the specific changes that dengue infection renders on the salivary gland protein profile of the mosquito vector and how these changes affect the establishment of infection in vertebrate cells. Furthermore we will evaluate the immune response of the vertebrate to Ae. aegypti salivary proteins and whether this response alters the course of dengue virus infection.Specific AimsAim 1: To characterize differential protein expression of saliva and salivary gland extract from Ae. aegypti between dengue-infected and uninfected mosquitoes. H0: Dissemination of dengue virus to the mosquito salivary glands changes the protein profile of thesaliva and salivary glands.Aim 2: To identify proteins in mosquito saliva and salivary gland extract capable of binding to dengue virus and human immune cells such as lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC). H0: Mosquito salivary proteins differentially expressed based on infection status may bind dengue virus and human lymphocytes, thereby enhancing the potential for dengue to establish replication intarget immune cells.Aim 3: To characterize the vertebrate host immune response to Ae. aegypti salivary proteins, and the impact of that response on dengue infection. H0: Innate immune responses and preexisting antibodies to mosquito salivary proteins affect the transmission success of dengue from the mosquito vector to the vertebrate. Dengue virus infection in the mosquito alters these immune responses through down regulation of salivary proteins.\",\n",

       " 'Dengue serotype 1 vaccine development: The live attenuated DEN1 vaccine candidate virus rDEN1del30 has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and was found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. An additional study has been completed to determine the number of doses and the timing of the two doses needed to achieve optimal immunization. The study involved 60 healthy flavivirus-naive adults randomized to receive 2 doses of rDEN1del30 (N=50) or placebo (N=10), either on study days 0 and 120 (cohort 1) or 0 and 180 (cohort 2). We sought to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this candidate vaccine in 50 additional vaccinees and to test whether the humoral immune response could be boosted by a second dose administered 4 or 6 months after the first dose.  The first dose of vaccine was well tolerated, infected 47/50 vaccinees and induced seroconversion in 46/50 vaccinees.  Irrespective of dosing interval, the second dose of vaccine was also well tolerated but did not induce any detectable viremia or &#8805; 4-fold rise in serum neutralizing antibody titer.  Only five subjects had an anamnestic antibody response detectable by ELISA following a second dose of vaccine, demonstrating that the vaccine induced sterilizing humoral immunity in most vaccinees for at least six months following primary vaccination. A separate clinical trial to determine the 50% infectious dose (HID50) was recently completed and showed that rDEN1del30 is highly infectious, even at the lowest dose administered (10 PFU). Dengue serotype 2 vaccine development: rDEN2/4del30(ME) is an attenuated chimeric dengue virus in which the prM and E structural proteins of the DEN4 candidate vaccine, rDEN4del30, have been replaced by those of the prototypic DEN2 NGC virus. The live attenuated DEN2 vaccine candidate virus rDEN2/4del30(ME) has been evaluated in Phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and immunogenic at a dose of 1000 PFU. Additional studies have been completed to address the number and timing of two doses of this vaccine candidate. Results obtained this year are similar to those observed previously with rDEN1del30 and showed that a second dose administered at 6 months did not boost the immune response to the primary dose, presumably due to complete neutralization of the second dose by the existing antibody. A separate clinical trial to determine the 50% infectious dose (HID50) was recently completed and showed that at the lowest dose administered (10 PFU), approximately half of the volunteers seroconverted to DEN2, indicating that the HID50 is close to 10 PFU.Dengue serotype 3 vaccine development: Due to the observed low infectivity of chimeric vaccine candidate rDEN3/4del30(ME), two additional DEN3 vaccine candidates were studied in which 1) the 3 UTR (untranslated region) of rDEN3 was replaced with that derived from attenuated rDEN4del30 to generate rDEN3-3D4del30, and 2) a pair of 3 UTR deletions were introduced into DEN3 to create vaccine candidate rDEN3del30/31.  Clinical evaluation showed that the rDEN3-3D4del30 vaccine was well-tolerated and 80% of the volunteers were infected.  In a separate clinical trial, the rDEN3del30/31 vaccine was shown to be well-tolerated with 95% of the volunteers becoming infected.  Both of these new DEN3 vaccine candidates were evaluated in tetravalent vaccine formulations.Dengue serotype 4 vaccine development: We currently consider the rDEN4del30 vaccine our leading DEN4 candidate for inclusion in the tetravalent vaccine. However, rDEN4del30-200,201 is a live attenuated DENV-4 vaccine candidate specifically designed to further attenuate the rDEN4del30 parent virus. In a recent clinical study, the vaccine infected 95% of vaccinees and was well tolerated without inducing ALT elevations. Although virus was not recovered from the serum of any vaccinee, moderate levels of neutralizing antibody were induced.  Both the rDEN4del30 and rDEN3del30/31 vaccine candidates were evaluated in tetravalent vaccine formulations. Tetravalent studies:  Phase I clinical studies were completed this year to evaluate four different tetravalent formulations containing 1000 PFU of each vaccine candidate.  Each formulation contained rDEN1del30 and rDEN2/4del30 along with the following DEN3 and DEN4 vaccine candidates: TV001 contained rDEN3-3D4del30 and rDEN4del30, TV002 contained rDEN3-3D4del30 and rDEN4del30-200,201, TV003 contained rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN4del30, and TV004 contained rDEN3del30/31 and rDEN3del30/31.  Each formulation was evaluated as a single dose in 20 vaccinees and 8 placebo recipients.  Preliminary results indicate that among the different formulations, the percentage of seroconversion to DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 80  100%, 50  65%, 60  85%, and 85  100%, respectively, with TV003 achieving the highest percent seroconversion (100, 50, 85, and 100% to the four serotypes).  Among the recipients of TV-003, 90% seroconverted to at least 3 serotypes (40% seroconverted to all 4 serotypes) after a single inoculation.  A fifth formulation is currently undergoing clinical evaluation and contains a 10-fold higher dose of the DENV-2 component in an attempt to increase seroconversion to DENV-2.Heterotypic dengue vaccination:  Since infection with any of the four DENV serotypes may elicit both protective neutralizing antibodies and non-neutralizing antibodies capable of enhancing subsequent heterotypic DENV infections, the greatest risk for severe dengue occurs during a second, heterotypic DENV infection. It remains unclear whether the replication of live-attenuated vaccine viruses will be similarly enhanced when administered to DEN-immune individuals. We recruited 36 healthy adult subjects who had previously received a monovalent live DENV vaccine 0.6  7.4 years earlier.  Subjects were assigned to one of four cohorts and randomly chosen to receive placebo or a heterotypic vaccine.  The level of replication, safety, and immunogenicity of the heterotypic vaccine virus was compared to that of DENV immunologically naive vaccinees. Results showed that vaccine virus replication and the reactogenicity following monovalent DENV vaccination in naive and heterotypically immune vaccinees was similar. In contrast to naive vaccinees, the antibody response in heterotypically immune vaccinees was broadly neutralizing and mimicked the response observed by natural secondary DENV infection. Overall, the enhancement of replication of these live-attenuated DENV vaccines was minimal in heterotypically-immune vaccinees and supports the further evaluation of these candidate vaccines in populations with pre-existing DENV immunity.',\n",
       " \"Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man, where they generally induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types, most frequently HPV 16. Our research is primarily concerned with development of vaccines and other infection inhibition strategies against HPV and the elucidation of the PV life cycle.   We have developed a simple and efficient strategy for generating high titers of infectious papillomavirus particles that transduce encapsidated marker plasmids, i.e. pseudovirions. We have exploited this technology in our basic virologic and translational research efforts.  We have used our pseudovirus technology to develop the first cervicovaginal challenge model for HPVs. We found that the infection of the female mouse genital tract, even of monolayer endocervical cells, requires exposure the basement membrane to the virus. The capsids bind avidly to the basement membrane but not to the apical surfaces of intact columnar or stratified squamous epithelia. Using a quantitative assay based on whole tissue fluorecence imaging after infection with red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing pseudovirions, we determined that nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and Conceptrol, an over the counter spermacide that containing N-9, dramatically potentiate in vivo papillomavirus infection, presumably due to it's ability to permeablize the epithelial layers and thereby expose the basement membrane to the virus. Interesting, no infection was detected if nonoxynol-9 was formulated in carrageenan rather than its normal gelling agent. Carrageenan is an algal polysaccharide widely used in processed food and cosmetics and is the main gelling agent in some over-the-counter lubricants. The results suggest that women using N-9 spermacides may be at increased risk of acquiring genital HPV infection and that this risk might be mitigated by reformulation of N-9 in a carrageenan based gel. Two NCI-sponsored clinical trial of carrageenan as a microbicide to prevent genital HPV infection in young women will soon commence, and we will collaborate on technical aspects of the trials. Our mouse cervicovaginal studies suggested that other interventions that compromise the integrity of the genital epithelium might potentiate HPV infection. Acquisition of ecto- and endocervical cells for cytology (Pap) screening disrupts the epithelium by design. Therefore we sought to determine whether the cytology specimen (Pap smear) collection procedure renders the cervix more susceptible to HPV infection in a rhesus macaque model. We found that the Pap smear collection procedure greatly potentiated infection by RFP expressing HPV16 pseudovirus. However, use of a carrageenan gel rather than Surgilube as the lubricant used for the internal digital exam after specimen collection largely abrogated the infection enhancing effect. These findings suggest that cytology screening in women might lead to a transient enhancement of susceptibility to HPV infection and that use of a carrageenan-based gel during the examine might mitigate this enhancement. The pseudovirus-based mouse cerviovaginal challenge model is also being used to explore the basic features of papillomavirus infection and the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus in the female reproductive tract. We have determined that, in a process unique to papillomaviruses, the initial steps in infection occur after initial binding to heperan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the basement membrane, prior cell surface binding. Specifically the virions undergo a conformational change that exposes the N-terminus of the L2 minor capsid protein to cleavage by furin, a cellular protease that we detect in abundance at the sites of infection in vivo. This cleavage in turns leads to exposure of highly conserved L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes that are immediately downstream of the cleavage site.  Blocking HSPG interactions or furin cleavage prevented cerviovaginal infection. In a process that takes several hours, the virions transfer from the basement membrane to the surface of keratinocytes invading the site of trauma, and the virions are then internalized. We have further determined that antibodies induced by L1 VLP vaccines (of type that are how commercially available) and L2 vaccines (which we developing as a more broadly cross type-neutralizing alternative) block in vivo infection by distinct mechanisms. L1 VLP antibodies block binding to the basement membrane, but allow binding to the keratinocytes. However, the L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes are not exposed and the virions are not internalized. L2 antibodies that broadly cross-neutralize HPV types permit the initial virion binding to the basement membrane HSPG. However, the virions are not detected in the tissue at later time points, suggesting that the L2 antibodies prevent stable transfer to the keratinocytes. These studies may well provide the most detailed mechanistic understanding of how a virus, in a living mammalian host, infects its relevant tissue and how vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in vivo. In vitro neutralizing assays we developed for L1 VLP vaccine analysis have proven to be insensitive for L2. Based on understanding of the in vivo infectious process, we have recently developed novel in vitro neutralizing assay that are 1000-fold more sensitive measure of L2 antibody activity. Our development of a method to induce efficient HPV pseudovirus infection of the female genital tract after transient disruption with N-9 has proven to be the key to our recent development of an effective intravaginal vaccination strategy. In patent pending studies, we have found that intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination of N-9 treated mice induces strong systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to target antigens transduced by the pseudovirions. Systemic responses rival those induced by previously optimized Ad5 vectors. Intravaginal responses are remarkably strong, with up to 80% of all intravaginal CD8 T cells staining tetramer positive for the targeted antigen. Most of the induced T appear to be intraepithelial and high level of effector memory CD8 T cells are maintained in the vaginal tract 100 days after vaccination.  Intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination is a promising approach for focusing immune responses to the female genital tract and so might increase the effectiveness of vaccines directed against HSV and HIV infections and against HPV induced neoplasia. This concept is now being testing in an SIV/rhesus macaque intravaginal challenge model in collaboration with Dr. Franchini. To more generally evaluate the potential of HPV pseudoviruses as gene transfer vehicles, we have conducted a broad infection tropism survey.  In patent pending studies, we demonstrated that intact murine epithelium at all sites, whether simple, columnar, or squamous, was highly resistant to both virion binding and infection, whereas disrupted epithelium was susceptible. In contrast, virtually all human-derived epithelial cell lines in the NC1-60 panel were highly susceptible to infection in vitro. The remarkable specificity of HPV pseudovirus binding and infection suggests that they may be useful in tumor diagnostic or cytotoxic gene therapy applications. In proof of concept studies, we documented highly specific binding and infection, and dramatic imaging, of human ovarian tumor nodules implanted in nude mouse peritoneum after intraperitoneal injection of RFP-expressing pseudovirus. In a preliminarly study using a mouse model of ovarian metastases, intraperitoneal injection of Herpes TK-expressing HPV psuedovirions followed by ganciclovir treatment, increased survival of tumor bearing mice.\",\n",

This provides well-defined vaccine viruses that can have improved properties. This also provides virus with a short, well-defined passage history that greatly diminishes the chance of adventitious agents. It  addition, the DNA intermediate provides a stable vaccine seed as well as the means to modify the virus as necessary in response to clinical data. Five cDNA-derived viruses have been evaluated to date in clinical studies, as described in previous years. The most promising virus, called rA2cp248/404/1030/delSH, was safe and immunogenic in young infants. However, there was evidence of loss of the 248 or 1030 attenuating point mutation (Tyr-1321-Asn or Gln-831-Leu, respectively, in the L protein) in some isolates. We are continuing to work to increase the genetic stability of this virus, and expect to have an improved candidate to enter phase 1 studies in 2011 or 2012. This ongoing work will be described in next years report. We also have identified new combinations of mutations that appear to have promising properties of attenuation and stability, and which also will be reported next year. As noted in an accompanying report, another new vaccine candidate, Medi delM2-2, entered phase 1 clinical studies in August, 2011.We also have been studying RSV immunobiology. One of the signal features of RSV is that it can readily re-infect symptomatically during infancy and throughout life without the need for significant antigenic change (in contrast, for example, with influenza A virus, for which significant antigenic change is needed for re-infection). This is frequently interpreted as evidence that RSV inhibits or subverts protective immunity. This is of potential importance for vaccine development. Previously, we showed that re-infection may be aided by a viral immune evasion mechanism involving a secreted form of the attachment G protein. As another approach to this issue, we previously initiated studies of the effects of RSV and other respiratory viruses on human dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. These are potent antigen presenting cells that play a major role in initiating and modulating the adaptive immune response. We compared the effects of RSV on human monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) in a side-by-side comparison with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using viruses that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) in order to monitor infection. We also included influenza A virus (Flu) in the comparison. We analyzed MDDC that were exposed to these viruses in vitro for the expression of 62 genes pertinent to maturation. One of these was CCR7, which normally is up-regulated during maturation and directs migration of antigen-bearing DC to T cell-rich zones in lymphatic tissue. We found that DCs infected with RSV or HMPV did not efficiently up-regulate CCR7, in contrast to HPIV3 and, especially, Flu. This was confirmed at the level of cell surface protein expression. In addition, HMPV and RSV did not efficiently down-regulate surface expression of CCR1, 2 and 5, which maintain DC residence in peripheral tissues and normally are down-regulated during maturation. In an in vitro migration assay, RSV- and HMPV-treated DC migrated less efficiently to the CCR7 ligand CCL19, which directs DC chemotaxis to lymphatic tissue. Secondary stimulation with lipopolysaccharide reversed this phenotype, suggesting that it is due to suboptimal stimulation rather than irreversible inhibition. This phenotype appeared to be partly due to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DC treated with HMPV and RSV. Inefficient migration of DC in response to RSV and HMPV infection could contribute to a dampening of the adaptive response to these viruses.We investigated whether these viruses differentially affect the activation of CD4 T cells by virus-treated DC, as has been widely hypothesized. We infected human MDDC with RSV, HMPV, HPIV3, or Flu, and compared their ability to induce proliferation of autologous CD4+ T cells in vitro. We investigated both virus-specific memory responses as well as superantigen-induced responses. In general, there was little evidence of virus-specific inhibition. There was a trend of increasing memory responses, HMPV < RSV < HPIV3 < Flu, but the differences were not significant. Overall, cytokine production by the proliferating T cells was similar among the different viruses, with no evidence of Th2 or Th17 skewing. These results provided no evidence of marked differences between the viruses in their effects on CD4 T cell activation.We recently demonstrated that the RSV NS1 protein, an antagonist of host type I interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling, also has a suppressive effect on the maturation of human dendritic cells (DC) due in part to suppression of IFN-I production. Here we investigated whether NS1 affects the ability of DC to activate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Human DC were infected with RSV deletion mutants lacking the NS1 and/or NS2 genes and assayed for the ability to activate autologous T cells in vitro, which were analyzed by flow cytometry. Deletion of the NS1, but not NS2, protein (i) increased the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells that express CD103, a tissue homing integrin that directs CD8+ T cells to the respiratory mucosa and triggers cytolytic activity (ii) increased the activation and proliferation of Th17 cells, which have recently been shown to have anti-viral effects, and (iii) skewed the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 by reducing the number of IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells, which are associated with enhanced RSV disease. Taken together, these data demonstrate that expression of NS1 by wild type RSV suppresses two protective cell populations (CD103+ CD8+ T cells and Th17 cells), and promotes Th2 cells that can enhance RSV disease. These studies are of particular relevance since vaccine candidates that are being developed include ones in which the NS1 or NS2 gene has been deleted. The present data suggest that a vaccine candidate lacking the NS1 gene would induce a qualitatively different immune response that might be associated with less reactogenicity and better protection.',\n",
       " 'We are studying the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and the molecular basis for virulence and attenuation of these important pathogens.  In collaborative studies with Dr. Frank Chisari (Scripps Institute) we  studied in chimpanzees the mechanism by which the host clears a hepatitis B virus infection and the relationship of these mechanisms to clinical disease. We demonstrated that the clearance of the template for HBV synthesis, covalently closed circular HBV DNA, is eliminated from hepatocytes by non-cytolytic mechanisms mediated principally by interferon gamma in the liver. Elimination of residual hepatocytes containing HBV antigens is a later event that is mediated by cytolytic CD8 positive T cells and is temporally related to the hepatitis phase of the infection. The spectrum of virus-induced and immune response-related genes involved in acute hepatitis B were further studied by microarray analysis of intrahepatic messenger RNAs up-regulated and down-regulated during the course of hepatitis B infections in chimpanzees. Surprisingly, we could not detect evidence of an innate immune response to infection, suggesting that HBV can subvert the host immune response, but we did detect a strong adaptive immune response during the clearance phase of infection; this correlated with the inhibition of viral replication and removal of infected cells described above. Interestingly, in additional studies of chronic HBV infection in chimpanzees, we found an innate immune response that was missing in acute, self-limiting infections of HBV.  This occurred at a time of liver damage, suggesting that viral and cellular products released from dead and dying hepatocytes could trigger other innate host defenses, such as TLR-3. However, the up-regulated innate immune responses were weak and insufficient to affect virus replication.The genetic heterogeneity of hepatitis C virus is believed to play an important role in its pathogenicity. We have previously examined this relationship by determining the genetic heterogeneity of HCV isolates that were recovered from patients who were infected following transfusion in order to study the early phase of infection and from patients undergoing interferon therapy in order to study changes during the later phase of chronic infection (these may be important in understanding late sequelae, such as liver cancer). Distinctive patterns of dynamic change in the sequence of viral clones during the first several weeks of infection were observed and these correlated with the outcome of infection. Similarly, the pattern of dynamic changes in sequence during interferon therapy was predictive of the outcome. These findings may be useful in predicting the outcome of therapy with interferon early in the course of treatment. Although considerable information has been gained from these longitudinal studies of patients, it is difficult to study the mechanisms of pathogenesis in such systems. Chimpanzees, which are the only animals other than man that are susceptible to infection with HCV, provide an experimental model for studying the interactions of the host and the virus in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C.  Recent studies in chimpanzees suggest that even late sequelae like liver cancer can be studied in the chimpanzee.  Collaborative studies with Frank Chisari have demonstrated that, as in hepatitis B virus infections, in hepatitis C virus infections the cellular immune response plays an important role in noncytolytic down-regulation of viral replication and cytolytic removal of residual infected cells. These two mechanisms are sequential and overlapping and the former appears to be mediated by interferon gamma and the latter by CD8 positive cells and, perhaps by interferon gamma through its proinflammatory activity. These studies have also revealed that type 1 interferon (interferon alpha/beta)-activated antiviral proteins are expressed in response to the viral infections, but that HCV is resistant to the antiviral activity of this innate immune response. Microarray studies of the host immune responses to viral hepatitis and how the hepatitis viruses attempt to circumvent the responses, are yielding important information on pathogenesis of these diseases, and the studies are being extended to the other hepatitis viruses in order to delineate the comparative pathogenesis of these agents in a single host, the chimpanzee, which is the only non-human host that is susceptible to all human hepatitis viruses. In 2010, we completed a microarray analysis of HCV and HEV infections of multiple chimpanzees, comparing the sequence of human and chimpanzee genomes for suitability in interpreting Affymetrix microarray data obtained from serial clinical samples of chimpanzees infected with one or the other of the two viruses.  We found that the human genome sequence was more sensitive and specific for identifying up-regulated and down-regulated genes, probably because it is better curated than the more recently sequenced chimpanzee genome.  We also compared two analytic methods, a method utilizing Affymetrix probe sets and correlation coefficients with one utilizing individual perfectly matched probes and t-test analysis.  Both analyses demonstrated similarities and differences in the host immune response to these two RNA viruses.  This information will be useful for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis.Currently, we are also studying the pathogenesis of HDV infections by microarray analysis and have identified both innate and adaptive immune responses to such infections. Immune responses to HDV infection were similar to those we observed during HCV infection: both a strong innate and a strong adaptive immune response.  The innate immune response was sufficient to down-regulate HBV replication in HBV chronically infected chimpanzees that were superinfected with HDV. Thus, HBV, although unable to trigger an innate immune response, is highly sensitive to such a response when provided by another virus.In 2011 we reproduced in cell culture the quasispecies evolution of HCV that had first been observed in vivo in chimpanzees that had been administered antibody to HCV.  The dynamics of quasispecies change over time were remarkably similar in vivo and in vitro.In other collaborative studies, we measured changes in the HCV receptors scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1), claudin-1 and occludin after liver transplantation and the influence of such changes on early viral kinetics.  There was a significant correlation between the amount of SRB1 in the liver at the time of reperfusion of the transplanted liver and the decay of the serum HCV-RNA titer, suggesting that a greater distribution of the receptor led to more rapid uptake of the virus by the liver.  Similarly, higher levels of claudin-1 and occludin in the liver correlated with more rapid recurrence of HCV in the transplanted liver, additional evidence of their importance in the uptake and replication of HCV in hepatocytes.',\n",
       " 'The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus and comprise some of the most medically significant emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. TBFV include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Powassan virus and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. Other flaviviruses include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Hence, research into the pathogenesis of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of this globally important group of viruses.  The research in our laboratory aims to identify and understand interactions between the TBFV and their hosts (both the arthropod and the mammal) critical to virus replication and pathogenesis. We study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV.  Studies using LGTV will form the basis for work on the more virulent BSL-3 Powassan virus and BSL-4 TBEV. 1.  Analysis of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. Ixodid ticks represent the natural reservoir of TBFV, are critical for virus persistence in nature, and are the major vector for infection of humans. Transmission of flaviviruses to humans occurs during tick feeding.  We have developed a first generation microarray to investigate salivary gland transcriptional changes in Ixodes scapularis nymphs during feeding or after infection with LGTV. The immediate goal of this work is to identify tick salivary gland transcripts that play a role during feeding or for the replication or transmission of TBFV.  The long-term goal of this work is to identify novel tick salivary gland genes that could be targeted for the development of vaccines that have the potential to disrupt tick feeding and/or flavivirus transmission. Comparison of fed and unfed ticks revealed a dramatic metabolic change reflected by up-regulation of 578 transcripts during feeding. A clear temporal pattern of gene expression changes was observed showing clusters of genes were specifically up-regulated at 1, 2 or 3 days of feeding. Comparison of LGTV-infected and uninfected ticks has identified 39 differentially regulated salivary gland transcripts over a time course of feeding. Differentially regulated transcripts have been annotated based on current knowledge from the Ixodes scapularis genome.  These transcripts are classified as putative secreted proteins, lipocalins, Kunitz protease inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, serpins, metalloproteases and transcripts of unknown function.  In 2011, the results of these studies were submitted as a manuscript to Ticks and Tick Borne Diseases. in addition, we are currently generating a series of recombinant proteins based on transcripts of interest, and will investigate the effect of these proteins on tick borne flavivirus infection in vitro and in vivo. Since dendritic cells are thought to be initial targets of TBFV delivered by tick bites, our studies will focus on these cells.2. Comparison of TBFV infection in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.  TBFV are maintained in nature in an infectious cycle that involves both tick and vertebrate hosts. Thus, these viruses must successfully replicate in two very distinct systems. One basic difference between these two systems is that flavivirus infection of tick cells is persistent, whereas infection of mammalian cells is typically acute and cytopathic. The genetic determinants and attendant host factors underpinning these phenomena are not well understood.  A.   Viral determinants of pathogenesis in the arthropod vector and the mammalian host.  In a previous study, we serially passaged Langat virus (LGTV) in either tick or mouse cell lines and found a limited number of amino acid mutations in these passaged viruses compared to the wildtype parental virus.  Interestingly, the tick-passaged virus exhibited reduced neuroinvasiveness when injected IP into mice compared to the wildtype parental or mouse-passaged virus.  Viral RNA from the brains of mice moribund following IP injection was characterized and five recurring amino acid changes were observed.  Because of the location of these changes, we speculated that the amino acid mutations enabling neuroinvasiveness compensated for the mutations observed following passage in tick cells.  In 2011, we have utilized a reverse genetics system to examine these amino acid mutations by introducing these specific amino acid mutations into the wildtype parental LGTV genome.  The mutations of interest have been inserted into a full-length molecular clone of LGTV, and viruses have subsequently been rescued. The viruses are currently being studied for growth in tick and mammalian cells in vitro.  An animal study protocol has been submitted to the IACUC for review and upon approval, we will begin examining the effects the introduced mutations have on the neuroinvasiveness of the LGTV.  B.  Microscopic comparison of TBFV infection in mammalian and tick cells.  A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum.  These rearranged membranes host virus replication and may protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems.  In the case of WNV and DEN, viral non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) has been implicated in the membrane rearrangements during infection.  However, similar analysis has not been done with TBFV in tick cell lines. We are comparing virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal and electron microscopy.  Electron microscopy has shown that TBFV-infected mammalian cells exhibit virus-induced vesicles, ER proliferation and accumulation of virions as early as 24 hrs post-infection.  By 48 hrs post-infection, the virions assemble into paracrystalline arrays and large amounts of vesicles are observed.  Significant cytopathic effect is observed at later timepoints.  In the TBFV-infected tick cells, vesicle formation occurs later than in the mammalian cells and is not as prominent. In contrast to the mammalian cells, tubular profiles predominate  instead of the sperical vesicles observed in the mammalian cells.  No virions were detected in the tick cells at any time point post-infection.  While this may simply be a consequence of the lower virus titer produced in the tick cells, these differences are currently being addressed using electron tomography to get a more detailed understanding of the virus-induced vesicle formation in the two different cell types. In addition to extending our work, in 2011, we have developed an in vitro model for persistent infection of tick cells and are examining these cells with the same array of techniques. Initial results, which are being quantitatively evaluated, suggest that the tubular profiles are more frequent in the persistently infected cells. The results from the microscopy experiments will form the groundwork for biochemical and genetic investigations.',\n",
       " '(1) To develop animal, especially nonhuman primate, models that mimic human disease:We have established nonhuman primate (NHPs) models using Cynomolgus macaques for several influenza A viruses including the swine-origin H1N1 (SOIV) and a seasonal H1N1 virus (Safronetz 2011), a seasonal H3N2 virus (Kobayashi 2009, poster), and H2N2 pandemic and H2N3 swine virus (Ma, in preparation). Infections differ in virus replication, clinical symptoms, disease progression and pathology. However, they mimic human disease quite well with the above mentioned strains.  Seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 & H3N2 lead to either asymptomatic or fairly mild disease in Cynomolgus macaques. Shortly after infection animals show reduced food intake and occasionally mild respiratory signs. Gross pathology is limited to a few areas in the lungs. Histopathological investigations of those areas reveal alveolar edema and fibrin, hyaline membrane formation and type II alveolar pneumocyte hyperplasia. Animals recover quickly form the infection and clear virus within the first few days. There is limited evidence for virus shedding from mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract (Brining 2010; Safronetz 2011).  The pandemic H2N2 strain A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) leads to a moderate infection compared to the seasonal strains with moderate clinical symptoms and respiratory signs. Lung infiltrates, gross pathology and histopathology are in general slightly enhanced compared to the infections with seasonal viruses. Animals clear the infection with a delay and fully recover. There is limited evidence for virus shedding from mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract (Ma, in preparation).  We observed different degrees of clinical severity, gross pathology, lung infiltration and histology in macaques when infected with three distinct SOIV isolates. A Mexican strain isolated from a moderately sick human A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) (M4108) behaved similarly to the pandemic H2N2 strain. A California isolate from a sick boy with moderate disease A/California/4/2009 (H1N1) (Ca04) was more severe and another Mexico strain from a cluster of severe cases A/Mexico/4487/2009 (H1N1) (M4487) was severe in clinical disease and pathology. No infection was lethal but the animals with the severe infection had not completely cleared virus at the end of the study (day 14). This clearly indicates that a variety of SOIV strains co-circulate with different pathogenic potential (Brining 2010; Safronetz 2011; Feldmann, in preparation).  Infection with the swine H2N3 virus A/swine/MS/06 (H2N3) was also more severe and was similar to the disease caused by the California strain of SOIV. Thus, this newly described swine virus has potential to infect primates and could potentially also infect humans (Ma, in preparation).  Furthermore, we have established the ferret model for influenza viruses here at RML. In a first round of experiments we have compared disease progression and virus replication of two pandemic H1N1 viruses, M4108 and M4487. In contrast to the differences we observed in the nonhuman primate model, both infections did not really differ in the ferret model with both viruses causing mild respiratory disease (Tsuda, in preparation; Tsuda 2011, poster)In conclusion, we have established nonhuman primate models for seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses which mimic influenza-associated disease in humans. These models seem to be of particular use for studying severe influenza disease. We also have established the influenza ferret models which we intend to use as screening models for influenza viruses. These models will in the future support research on intervention strategies (vaccines and therapeutics). (2) To identify and characterize determinants of pathogenicity in animal models:To better understand the features that define highly lethal influenza viruses, we exploited a technology for the artificial generation and modification of influenza viruses (reverse genetics system). Using this technology, we have generated a consensus pandemic SOIV (H1N1) virus (parent virus). In order to study virulence of the different strains (isolates) and the mechanisms of pathogenesis we have generated selected recombinant viruses and characterized those mutants in vitro.  For this we have compared the genome sequences of two early circulating SOIV strains with different pathogenicity in humans; M4108 and M4487. Sequence comparison revealed amino acid changes in 5 genomic segments, PB2, PA, HA, NP and M. The recombinant viruses were generated on the background of M4108 by replacing the corresponding genomic segment using the reverse genetics system. We have extensively characterized the recombinant viruses in tissue culture and found that the growth kinetics are similar (Tsuda 2011, poster). We are planing to investigate the in vivo characteristics of these recombinant viruses first in ferrets followed by selected recombinants in macaques. (3) To identify potential targets for intervention:The inherent virulence properties of the 1918 virus together with the emergence of pandemic SOIV and the continued pandemic potential posed by circulation of the highly virulent H5N1 virus indicated the need for evaluating antiviral options against infections with virulent influenza viruses. Therefore, the recently developed Cynomolgus macaque model for the 1918 influenza virus was used for a drug efficacy study. We demonstrated that oseltamivir phosphate is effective in preventing severe disease in Cynomolgus macaques caused by the 1918 influenza virus if given prophylactically. Efficacy was reduced in a treatment regime through emergence of oseltamivir-resistant mutants that lead to death of one of four animals.  This emphasizes the importance of implementing combination therapy and vaccination strategies early in a pandemic such as the current one caused by the emerged swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus. The study is currently still under revision after initial journal submission; the revision included further animal experiments. We are planing to resubmit shortly (Feldmann, in revision).(4)To develop cross-protective vaccines and test their efficacy in the developed animal models:In collaboration with Dr. J. Roses laboratory we have generated and characterized VSV-based vaccines that express the HK/156 (clade 0) H5 HA from the first position of the VSV genome. These vectors induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses of different clades in mice. The vaccines provide complete protection against morbidity and mortality after heterologous challenge with clade 0 and clade 1 strains in animals even 1 year after vaccination. Post-challenge pulmonary virus loads show that these vectors provide sterilizing immunity. Therefore, VSV-based avian influenza vaccines are potent, broadly cross-protective pandemic vaccine candidates (Schwartz 2010). In the next fiscal year we will continue our efforts to develop influenza vaccines. (5) Increased pathogenicity upon viral and bacterial co-infection in nonhuman primates:Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. This seems also be the case with the current pandemic SOIV strains. In order to study a potentiating effect of influenza and bacterial co-infection we performed a co-infection study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA were either asymptomatic or developed mild clinical symptoms. Animals infected with Ca04 developed mild to moderate clinical symptoms. Upon co-infection at different time points there was no significant increase in clinical disease in any of the animals.  Virology and histopathology are still ongoing.',\n",
       " 'We have previously reported the first randomized study of any kind in patients with nonmetastatic, castrate-resistant (D0.5) prostate cancer. The study employed vaccine, the hormone nilutamide, and the combined therapy (crossover for each arm) with an endpoint of time to progression. A follow-up survival analysis has been performed. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive either a poxvirus-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) vaccine or nilutamide and median survival among all patients was 4.4 years from date of enrollment. Median survival exhibited a trend toward improvement for patients initially randomized to the vaccine arm (median, 5.1 versus 3.4 years; P = 0.13). A subset of 12 patients who initially received vaccine and then later received nilutamide suggested improved survival compared with the 8 patients who began with nilutamide and subsequently were treated with vaccine (median, 6.2 vs. 3.7 years; P = 0.045). These data suggest that patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (D0.5) who receive vaccine before second-line hormone therapy may potentially result in improved survival when compared with patients who received hormone therapy and followed by vaccine.  Based on these findings, a follow-up study is being conducted. This study is currently enrolling patients with D0.5 prostate cancer on testosterone suppression therapy who have a rising PSA. Patients are stratified by PSA doubling time and randomized to androgen receptor antagonist alone (flutamide) or flutamide plus Prostavac. (Prostvac-VF is a vector-based, therapeutic cancer vaccine regimen consisting of recombinant poxviruses containing the transgenes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and 3 T-cell co-stimulatory molecules). A previous randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study demonstrated an 8.5-month improvement in median survival (25.1 months for Prostvac group vs. 16.6 months for control group) in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer) Flutamide is given at the standard dose of 250 mg TID while Prostvac is given by monthly subcutaneous injections. The primary endpoint of the study is time to treatment failure (TTF) which is defined as biochemical recurrence (PSA rise) or development of metastatic lesions on scans. The first 26 patients enrolled are evaluated in this analysis. For flutamide alone (n = 13), the median age at enrollment was 64.7 years and median Gleason Score was 8. For flutamide + Prostvac (n = 13), the median age at enrollment was 67.1 years and median Gleason score was 8. Median time to progression is 223 days for Fluatmide + Prostvac (range 70-638) vs. 85 days for Flutamide alone (56-372). Progression for 11/12 flutamide alone patients and 9/10 fluatmide + Prostvac patients has been by PSA rise only. Preliminary evidence from this second randomized trial suggests improvement in time to treatment failure using combination of hormonal therapy with flutamide + PSA-TRICOM vaccine compared to fluatmide alone in patients with non-metastatic CRPC. This trial will continue to accrue a total of 62 patients and also will evaluate immunological responses. Preclinical models investigated in the LTIB suggest that vaccine induced anti-tumor effects can be enhanced by radiation. We are currently investigating a radiation/vaccine combination trial. A randomized phase 2.5 study of 153Sm-EDTMP (Quadramet) with or without a PSA/TRICOM vaccine in men with androgen-insensitive metastatic prostate cancer, MOB, CCR, NCI. This trial is the first clinical trial to combine vaccine with a bone seeking radionuclide for use in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer. This study has accrued half the total number of patients and there is preliminary suggestion of benefit for the combination of vaccine and radiation. We have previously conducted a study combining an anti-CTLA-4 molecule with vaccine, in the first clinical trial to combine an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and a vector-based vaccine in prostate cancer. This study suggested no increase in side effects vs. anti-CTLA4 therapy alone (based on previous studies.). The immune data from the study suggested that some patients had enhanced immune response and the median over survival was greater than in previous trials with vaccine alone. This hypothesis-generating study lays the ground work for future trials that may combine a vaccine with an immune checkpoint inhibitor such as anti-CTLA-4. Additional combination studies are ongoing: --A randomized Pilot Phase II study of Docetaxel alone or in combination with PANVAC-V (vaccinia) and PANVAC-F (fowlpox) in adults with metastatic breast cancer. MOB, CCR, NCI. This is the first randomized trial to combine vaccine with Docetaxel in this breast cancer patient population. --A Phase I-II study of tumor vaccine following chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer: Vaccine-induced bias of T-cell repertoire reconstitution after T-cell reinfusion (Collaboration with Dr. Sportes) MOB, CCR, NCI. This trial combines the concepts of T-cell repertoire reconstitution with vaccine therapy. --An open label pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PANVAC-V (Vaccinia) and PANVAC-F (Fowlpox) in combination with Sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma, MOB, CCR, NCI. This trial employed vectors with transgenes of both multiple tumor antigens and multiple costimulatory molecules. A recent amendment allowed additional patients to further analyze the efficacy of the vaccine. --Collaborative Trials with Extramural Cancer Centers: A phase II study of PROSTVAC-V(Vaccinia)/TRICOM and PROSTVAC-F(fowlpox)/TRICOM with GM-CSF in patients with PSA progression after local therapy for prostate cancer (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group).

       " 'H2N2 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: H2N2 viruses caused the 1957 influenza pandemic and circulated in humans until 1968 when they were replaced by H3N2 viruses. Although H2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. An H2 vaccine is a high priority in preparing for a pandemic because H2 viruses have a proven capability for causing disease in humans and persons born after 1968 lack H2-specific immunity. Because the currently licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine utilized in the United States bears the internal protein genes of the influenza A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus, the A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus was a logical first choice for evaluation as an H2 vaccine candidate. However, this virus with the H2 HA and N2 NA had not been evaluated in seronegative people. An IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) virus. Twenty-one subjects received the first dose and 18 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H6N1 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H6N1 ca vaccine based on A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/1997 (H6N1). Twenty-two participants received the first dose of the vaccine, and 18 received the second dose of vaccine 4 weeks later. The vaccine had a safety profile similar to that of other investigational LAIVs bearing avian hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. The vaccine was highly restricted in replication: two participants had virus detectable by rRT-PCR beyond day 1 after each dose.  Antibody responses to the vaccine were also restricted: 43% of participants developed a serum antibody response as measured by any assay: 5% by hemagglutination-inhibition assay, 5% by microneutralization assay, 29% by ELISA for H6 HA-specific IgG and 24% by ELISA for H6 HA specific IgA after either 1 or 2 doses. Following the second dose, vaccine specific IgG and IgA secreting cells as measured by ELISPOT increased from a mean of 0.6 to 9.2/106 PBMCs and from 0.2 to 2.2/106 PBMCs, respectively. In conclusion, the H6N1 LAIV had a safety profile similar to that of LAIV bearing other HA and NA genes, but was highly restricted in replication in healthy seronegative adults. The H6N1 LAIV was also not as immunogenic as the seasonal LAIV.H2N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H2N3 ca vaccine based on A/swine/MO/2006 (H2N3). Nineteen subjects received the first dose and 15 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H7N7 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H7N7 ca vaccine based on A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7). Fifteen subjects received the first dose and 13 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H7N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  We had previously evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of the vaccine administered by nasal spray 5 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adult volunteers in an inpatient isolation unit. The subjects were followed for 2 months after 1 dose of vaccine or for 4 weeks after the second dose. The live attenuated H7N3 vaccine was well-tolerated but was highly restricted in replication in healthy seronegative adults. Despite the restricted replication, the vaccine was immunogenic, with serum IgA being the most sensitive measure of immunogenicity. A study to evaluate the safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine was undertaken. Twenty subjects received a single dose of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.',\n",
       " 'Models for the ultimate development of effective vaccines and immunotherapies that would limit HIV replication can be drawn from naturally occurring examples of immune system-mediated control.  Identifying the components, targets, and magnitude of an effective immune response to HIV are important steps toward developing effective vaccines and immunotherapies. Although patients with normal CD4+ T cell counts and low levels of plasma virus are a heterogeneous group, a small subgroup of patients with truly non-progressive HIV infection and restriction of virus replication likely holds important clues to the basis of an effective immune response to HIV. A small subpopulation of HIV-infected individuals (fewer than 0.8%) shows no signs of disease progression over a 10-year period. We have assembled a stringently defined cohort of such patients, termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs), or elite controllers. Many of these patients have been infected for 20 years, yet even without receiving antiretroviral therapy, they have experienced no CD4+ T-cell decline and have maintained plasma viral RNA levels below 50 copies per milliliter. We are using cells from these patients to systematically dissect the mechanisms of immune-mediated restriction of virus replication. The HIV-specific T-cell responses of these patients have been studied in extreme detail. Through this project, considerable progress has been made in understanding how the immune system controls HIV.  Our prior work indicated that there is a dramatic association between immunologic control and the HLA B*5701 allele, and that the immune response is highly focused on peptides restricted by this allele. This result established both host genetic and functional links between immunologic control and the CD8+ T-cell responses of these patients.  More recently, we have found that this focus is specific to HIV and is not found in the response to other pathogens such as hepatitis C virus or cytomegalovirus. LTNPs and progressors do not differ in the frequency of HIV-specific T cells or in the ability to recognize the autologous virus.  The finding of high frequencies of CD8+ T cells specific for the patients virus in both LTNPs and progressors strongly suggested that differences between responses of these patient groups were qualitative rather than quantitative in nature.  One important qualitative difference in the HIV-specific immune response that distinguishes LTNPs from progressors is the maintenance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with a high proliferative capacity. This proliferation parallels perforin expression required for effective killing of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. We have previously established the properties of the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response that are tightly associated with the LTNP phenotype.  Although the HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs have a greater capacity to proliferate and increase their number of molecules responsible for killing HIV-infected cells, the mechanism(s) by which these properties translate into effective immunologic control of HIV has remained unknown. Most current assays are not sufficiently powerful to establish if differences in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell function are determined by frequency, CD8+ T-cell proliferation, preferential target or effector cell death, or the mechanism of HIV-infected cell elimination.  To better understand the mechanisms of immunologic control, we devised a method to measure HIV-infected cell elimination on a per-cell basis.  Measured on a per-cell basis, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs efficiently eliminated primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. This effective killing was clearly distinguishable from the responses of progressors over a very broad range of effectors to HIV-infected targets.  Progressor cells did not mediate effective killing even at high effector-to-target ratios.  Defective cytotoxicity of progressor effectors could be restored in vitro. These results establish an effector function and a mechanism that clearly segregate with immunologic control of HIV.One of the original goals of our work in LTNP was to provide insights regarding important elements of the cellular immune response that should be induced in vaccination. Cytotoxic capacity is a function that clearly differentiates LTNP from untreated or treated progressors without immune-mediated control of HIV. Although this function clearly distinguishes those with immunologic control in the setting of chronic infection, it may not necessarily be the operative mechanism in control induced by an HIV vaccine.  Previously, direct measurements of recall cytotoxic capacity assessed by granzyme B target cell activity and infected CD4+ T-cell elimination had not been applied to recipients of HIV vaccines.We recently examined the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity of HIV-1-uninfected recipients of the Merck Ad5/HIV trivalent vaccine. Of the HIV vaccines used in recent human trials, understanding the response to this vaccine is among the highest priorities of HIV vaccinologists.  A very high profile efficacy trial employing this vaccine was the Step study, a phase IIB test-of-concept trial involving 3,000 HIV-negative individuals at high risk of HIV infection.  After one year of follow up, HIV RNA levels were comparable among those who became infected regardless of immunization.  Initial analyses, using standard ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays, revealed no association between vaccine-induced HIV-specific immunity and viral load.  These findings suggested that if vaccine-induced immunologic control is to succeed, future candidate vaccines need to elicit responses of higher magnitude or different breadth or function.We therefore sought to examine whether this vaccine, thought to be among the most immunogenic in current development, was successful in inducing cytotoxic capacity. Readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses were observed in vaccinees based on measurements of GrB target cell activity and infected CD4+ T-cell elimination. Significant responses were present a median of 331 days following the last immunization, confirming that long-lived memory cells had been induced with this vaccine strategy. We observed that the ability of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8+ T cells to kill primary autologous HIV-infected targets was relatively low and not comparable to responses we have previously associated with immunologic control. This low cytotoxic capacity was not related to precursor or effector cell frequencies.  We observed that the cytotoxic responses of vaccine recipients carrying HLA class I alleles associated with nonprogressive HIV infection, e.g., B*27, B*57 and B*58, were significantly greater than those of individuals not possessing these alleles (median ICE 48.7% versus 25.4%, respectively, p=0.001).  These findings suggest that the relatively poor ability of this vaccine to reduce viral loads upon natural infection is potentially attributable to the relatively poor induction of cytotoxic capacity.Taken together our work suggests that cytotoxic capacity is a clear correlate of immunologic control of HIV in chronic infection and may also be an important immune correlate in vaccinees.  Overall, the prevalence of per-cell cytotoxic capacity approaching that of LTNP was limited to only a few vaccinees consistent with the prevalence of immune control in the Step study.  In addition, the greater cytotoxic capacity induced in participants with protective alleles is consistent with associations between MHC alleles and viral load in vaccinees.  Over the coming years we are optimistic that this work will provide a long-sought after T cell correlate of immunity that will accelerate vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'The hemagglutinin of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is a derivative of and is antigenically related to classical swine but not to seasonal human H1N1 viruses. We compared the A/California/7/2009 (CA/7/09) virus recommended by the WHO as the reference virus for vaccine development, with two classical swine influenza viruses A/swine/Iowa/31 (sw/IA/31) and A/New Jersey/8/1976 (NJ/76) to establish the extent of immunologic cross-reactivity and cross-protection in animal models. Primary infection with 2009 pandemic or NJ/76 viruses elicited antibodies against the CA/7/09 virus and provided complete protection from challenge with this virus in ferrets; the response in mice was variable and conferred partial protection. Although ferrets infected with sw/IA/31 virus developed low titers of cross-neutralizing antibody, they were protected from pulmonary replication of the CA/7/09 virus. The data suggest that prior exposure to antigenically related H1N1 viruses of swine-origin, by prior infection or receipt of the swine flu vaccine of 1976, provide some protective immunity against the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 virus.There are several potential strategies for the development of vaccines to protect humans against influenza viruses, including formalin inactivated whole or split virus, HA subunit, and live attenuated virus vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have several attributes related to safety, immunogenicity, cross-protection against antigenic drift strains, high yield and needle-free administration that make them attractive candidates for control of pandemic influenza. Live attenuated vaccines generally induce broadly cross-reactive protection, which may be a useful feature in the event of a pandemic if a vaccine generated from the actual pandemic strain is not available. LID scientists collaborated with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to evaluate candidate vaccines against pandemic influenza viruses, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. The vaccine virus generated by MedImmune contains the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus and the attenuating genes from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold adapted (A/AA/6/60 ca) donor virus. The role of seasonal influenza vaccination in pandemic H1N1 disease was important to address because a large segment of the population is vaccinated annually. We administered one or two doses of a live attenuated pandemic H1N1 vaccine (p-LAIV), a seasonal trivalent inactivated (s-TIV) or seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine (s-LAIV) to mice and ferrets and subsequently challenged them with a pandemic H1N1 virus. In both species, the p-LAIV vaccine was immunogenic and conferred complete protection against challenge. s-TIV did not confer protection in either animal model and s-LAIV did not confer any protection in ferrets. In mice, two doses of s-LAIV led to complete protection in the upper respiratory tract and partial protection in the lungs. Our data indicate that vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccines did not confer complete protection in the lower respiratory tract in either animal model while the p-LAIV vaccine conferred complete protection in both animal models. Our observations also indicate that exposure to seasonal influenza vaccines may play a role in reducing susceptibility and morbidity from pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection and suggest the importance of exploring the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon.The factors underlying the epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were undefined. Although the virus is genetically and antigenically distinct from seasonal human H1N1 viruses, the clinical data from the pandemic suggested that prior exposure to influenza played a significant role in susceptibility to disease and immune response to the pandemic virus. Individuals over 50 years of age had antibodies that cross-reacted with and appeared to be less susceptible to infection with the pandemic H1N1 (p-H1N1) virus, presumably due to prior exposure to an antigenically related H1N1 influenza virus. In addition, data from p-H1N1 vaccine trials suggested that a large segment of the population had been exposed to an influenza virus that  primed  individuals such that only one dose of the novel pandemic vaccine was sufficient to elicit a protective antibody titer. This observation was unexpected because studies conducted in the 1970s had shown that 2 doses of vaccine were needed to immunize a nave population. We evaluated the effect of seasonal (s) H1N1 infection, s- trivalent inactivated vaccine (s-TIV) and s- trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (s-LAIV) prior to immunization with a pandemic live attenuated vaccine (p-LAIV) in mice. We compared serum and mucosal antibody, pulmonary CD8 and CD4 responses and the virologic response to challenge with a wild-type 2009 pandemic H1N1 (p-H1N1) virus. Two doses of p-LAIV induced cellular immune and robust ELISA and neutralizing antibody responses that were associated with complete protection from p-H1N1 challenge. A single dose of p-LAIV induced a cellular response and ELISA but not neutralizing antibody response and incomplete protection from p-H1N1 virus challenge. Primary infection with s-H1N1 influenza virus followed by a dose of p-LAIV resulted in cross-reactive ELISA antibodies and a robust cellular immune response that was also associated with complete protection from p-H1N1 virus challenge. A lower magnitude but similar response associated with partial protection was seen in mice that received a dose of s-LAIV vaccine followed by p-LAIV. Mice that received a dose of s-TIV followed by p-LAIV did not show any evidence of priming. In summary, prior infection with a seasonal influenza virus or s-LAIV primed mice for a robust response to a single dose of p-LAIV that was associated with protection equivalent to two doses of the matched pandemic vaccine.',\n",
       " \"Flaviviruses such as West Nile (WN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), St. Louis encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses are important neurotropic human pathogens, causing outbreaks of diseases in humans and domestic animals in many regions of the world. The emergence of WN in North America has resulted in a significant increase in the disease being observed in birds, horses, and humans. During the 1999-2010 outbreaks of WN in the USA, there were at least 29,982 reported human cases of WN illness that included 1,303 deaths. Since there is no antiviral drug and no vaccine effective against WN infection, it is considered a significant public health threat in the USA. Tick-borne encephalitis is a severe disease affecting thousands of people throughout Eurasia. Despite the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines in endemic areas, an increasing incidence of TBEV during the past 2 decades emphasizes the need for an alternative vaccine that will induce a more durable immunity and protection against TBEV. In an effort to develop the efficacious live attenuated vaccines against neurotropic flaviviruses, we explored several strategies, and progress toward this goal in the past year is reviewed below.In the first approach, the live attenuated TBEV or WN vaccine candidates are being developed in the Neurotropic Flaviviruses Section of the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV or WN with a non-neuroinvasive, mosquito-borne dengue-4 virus (DEN4d30) that contains an attenuating mutation, a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3'-noncoding region (3'NCR). Chimeric TBEV/DEN4d30 virus that contains the structural protein genes of a highly virulent TBEV demonstrates moderate levels of immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice and monkeys, but retains an unacceptably high level of neurovirulence based on the results of clinical observations and analysis of virus-induced histopathology in the CNS of monkeys. Further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4d30 neurovirulence was achieved by introducing amino acid substitutions that had previously been shown to reduce replication of tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) or DEN4 in suckling mouse brain. When attenuating mutations such as amino acid substitutions in the envelope E (Lys315 > Glu) and NS5 (Asp654Arg655 >AlaAla) proteins were introduced into the TBEV/DEN4d30 genome, the resulting virus (TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655) demonstrated the desired properties of an acceptable live attenuated vaccine. In FY 2011, we demonstrated that this virus was genetically stable in the brain of suckling mice and safe for the CNS as shown by a reduced level of cellular inflammatory response and neuronal degeneration. TBEV/DEN4 and its d30 mutant induced severe neuroinflammation, whereas virus-induced inflammatory changes were not observed in the brains of mice with TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655 or mock-inoculated controls. The vaccine candidate exhibits a limited potential for transmission in nature since it was unable to infect or replicate in mosquitoes and ticks.  In addition, we demonstrated that the immunogenicity and protective efficacies of our vaccine candidate and commercial inactivated TBEV vaccine were similar in mice challenged with wild-type European or Far Eastern strains of TBEV. Thus, TBEV/DEN4d30-E315-NS5-654,655 virus is a promising TBEV vaccine candidate, but its ability to induce a long-lasting protective immunity against TBEV, the effect of boost immunizations, and its level of neurovirulence in the CNS of non-human primates need to be evaluated prior to testing in humans. A live attenuated WN/DEN4d30 virus vaccine developed in the LID to protect humans against WN disease was well-tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response in healthy adult volunteers. Further studies of neurovirulence in monkeys are necessary to provide the additional evidence of safety of this vaccine for the CNS of non-human primates prior to its use in the risk group of volunteers >50 years of age. In FY 2011, we performed a comparative analysis of neuropathogenesis in rhesus monkeys following intrathalamic inoculation with the wild type WN virus or the WN/DEN4d30, DEN4d30, or yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine. The clinical and virology data indicated that the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine is a most attenuated virus in the CNS compared to either comparator virus as demonstrated by a lack of virus replication in the brain and spinal cord and the absence of clinical signs of neurological disease. In the coming year, we plan to further evaluate the spatiotemporal distributions of viral antigens, virus-induced histopathology, cellular inflammatory response, and neuronal degeneration in the CNS of monkeys.  In the second approach for the design of safe and effective live flavivirus vaccines, we explored the ability of the CNS-expressed cellular microRNAs to modulate the neurotropism and pathogenesis of flaviviruses. The inclusion of a single target copy for a brain tissue-expressed miRNA (let-7c, mir-9, mir-124a, mir-128a, or mir-218) into the TBEV/DEN4 genome was sufficient to prevent the development of otherwise lethal encephalitis in adult mice. However, in FY2011, we demonstrated that the efficacy of miRNA-mediated inhibition of virus replication in the immature CNS of suckling mice depends on the genetic stability of the miRNA-targeted virus and it can revert to virulent phenotype by accumulating mutations within the miRNA target sequence. Following intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice with TBEV/DEN4 viruses carrying a single miRNA-target copy, the brain-isolated viruses from moribund mice contained partially or completely deleted miRNA-target sequence. The risk of virus escape from miRNA-mediated inhibition in the CNS was significantly minimized by increasing the number of target sites in the viral genome for broadly CNS-expressed miRNAs (mir-9 and mir-124a). We found that a location of miRNA-targets in the 3'NCR of the TBEV/DEN4 genome as well as the distance between the inserted miRNA target sites affect the level of miRNA-mediated inhibition of virus replication. Multiple miRNA-target insertions (2, 3, or 4 copies) into the 3'NCR of viral genome altered virus neuroinvasiveness for immunodeficient mice and significantly attenuated its neurovirulence for suckling mice, but did not impaired its immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Importantly, the miRNA-targeting of a large portion of the 3'NCR with the multiple miRNA-binding sites greatly reduced the probability of virus to escape from miRNA-mediated suppression even in the immature CNS of newborn mice. These findings suggest that a microRNA-targeting approach to control the virus tissue tropism could provide a new basis for future design of safe and effective live virus vaccines against neurotropic flaviviruses.\",\n",
       " 'Background- We were encouraged by the results that a short treatment with the CTLA-4 blocking antibody MDX-010 was associated with decreased viral RNA levels in lymph nodes and an increase in the effector function of both SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, we pursued this approach and tested the efficacy of protracted CTLA-4 blockade treatment with and without vaccination or vaccination alone as a control. We found that protracted CTLA-4 blockade significantly increased T-cell activation and viral replication in primary SIVmac251 infection, particularly at mucosal sites, and increased IDO expression and activity. Accordingly, protracted treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody of RMs chronically infected with SIVmac251 decreased responsiveness to antiretroviral therapy and abrogated the ability of therapeutic T-cell vaccines to decrease viral set point. These data provide the first direct evidence that immune activation drives viral replication and suggest caution in the use of long term therapeutic approaches that increase immune activation in the treatment of HIV infection. Another study showed that antiretroviral therapy treatment and virus suppression is sufficient to reduce death ligand but not death receptors in lymphoid tissue of SIV-infected macaques.  We studied mRNA expression of molecules involved in programmed cell death (TRAIL and FasL) and their receptors (DR5 and Fas) in blood and lymph nodes collected longitudinally from SIV-infected RMs before and after antiretroviral therapy. TRAIL, FasL, DR5, and Fas expression were elevated in circulating CD4+ T-cells from SIV-infected RMs and antiretroviral therapy reduced both TRAIL and DR5 expression in peripheral blood, but only TRAIL and not DR5, in lymph nodes from the same animals. These findings suggest that antiretroviral therapy is ineffective in reducing expression of apoptotic death receptors in lymphoid tissue and that analysis limited to blood leukocytes may not reveal such a defect. Our results highlight the persistence of an underlying immunologic condition that may prevent therapy-induced restoration of CD4+ T-cells in lymphoid tissues. Interferon alfa Blockade- The early stages of infection present formidable obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection. Understanding and exploiting these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive infection in an exposed host. The early stages of genital transmission can not be studied in humans, thus, intra-vaginal SIV infection of RMs represents one of the best animal models in which to study these events. We will test the contribution of the early innate IFN response at the mucosal portal of entry to the establishment and rate of dissemination of SIV infection in RMs. We will inhibit the biological activity of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta by treating RMs with a blocking antibody, 64G12, that targets the receptor for all these interferons. Indeed 64G12 inhibits SIV-AT-2 induced IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha production in pDCs of RM. Specifically, we wish to test the effect of 64G12 on 1) The establishment of intravaginal SIV infection in RMs and the rate of SIV dissemination to mucosal and peripheral LT, 2) viral and CD4+ T-cell dynamics and the SIV-specific immune responses, and 3) the levels of mucosal and systemic immune activation, and disease progression. The early stages of infection present formidable obstacles that the virus must overcome to establish infection. Understanding and exploiting these weaknesses may provide a chance to prevent productive infection in an exposed host.  CQ treatment- Earlier in vitro studies indicated that CQ can block HIV envelope glycosylation and HIV replication. However, two small clinical trials reported only modest reductions in plasma virus of 0.4-0.6 log copies/ml. More recently, CQ has been shown to block HIV-induced immune activation as well as HIV-activated IFN-alpha production and PDL-1 expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in normal human PBMCs. It should also be noted that CQ was recently reported to enhance astrocyte permissiveness to HIV infection, raising the possibility of complicating and detrimental effects of this drug. We propose to study the in vivo effects of CQ administration on SIV infection of RMs. Anti PD-1 treatment- We found that SIV specific T-cells have a proliferative defect that may explain the inability of vaccines to eliminate infected cells. SIV specific CD8+T-cells express high level of PD-1 and cytokines, and have impaired proliferative capacity in acute and chronic SIVmac251 infection. Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) is a critical mediator of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. We examined the expression of PD-1 on SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells and its possible involvement in the regulation of cytokine production, proliferation, and survival of these cells. We found that the majority of SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed a PD-1(high) phenotype, independently of their differentiation status, in all tissues tested. PD-1 expression gradually declined on CD8+ T-cells specific for SIV-derived epitopes that had undergone mutational escape, indicating that antigen-specific TCR stimulation is the primary determinant of PD-1 expression. SIV-specific PD-1(high) CD8+ T-cells produced IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 under cognate peptide stimulation but had a reduced proliferative capacity when compared to PD-1 (low) SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells. PD-1(high) SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells were highly susceptible to cell death leading to loss of such cells after in vitro stimulation. Thus, PD-1 may negatively affect the maintenance of effective CD8+ T-cell responses to HIV/SIV, and manipulation of the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands could result in restoration of the T-cell responses in SIV infection. IL-21 treatment- We have studied in detail the immunological damage induced by SIV infection at mucosal sites of infected macaques and found that IL-17 producing CD4+T-cells (Th17), a lineage of effector CD4+ T-helpers recently identified, are infected by SIVmac251 in vitro and in vivo, and their frequency significantly decreases at mucosal and systemic sites within a few weeks of infection. In animals that progress to disease, Th1 cells are over-represented compared to Th17 cells whereas, in SIVmac251-infected elite controller RMs, a normal Th17/Th1 balance is maintained. Indeed, regression analysis of the frequency of Th17 cells at mucosal sites and plasma virus level demonstrates a negative correlation, suggesting their importance in HIV/SIV pathogenesis. Because Th17 cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immune responses to extracellular bacteria, our finding may explain the chronic enteropathy in HIV infection. Thus, therapeutic approaches to reconstitute an adequate balance between Th1 and Th17, like IL-21 treatment, may be considered to ameliorate the clinical course of HIV infection.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to preventive HIV vaccines conducted by the VRC Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center. These consist of a screening protocol and clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines including: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. A brief summary of each study to date follows.The screening protocol, VRC 000 (02-I-0127), facilitates recruitment and screening of healthy, HIV-negative subjects for investigational preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials. Educational materials on vaccines are reviewed with and provided to subjects before enrollment into a study.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5): p. 601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published Vaccine, 2007. 25(20): p. 4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) was a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed.   VRC 009 (05-I-0081) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLOS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p. 1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) was a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed.  The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 016 (11-I-0197) is a Phase Ib descriptive study to evaluate the kinetics and pattern of early innate and adaptive immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, alone and after priming with DNA vaccine.  This study was developed and initiated in FY11  HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase II study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed to begin a new phase of evaluation. It is designed to see whether or not the vaccines have an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who later acquire HIV infection during about 3 years of follow-up.',\n",
       " \"Papillomaviruses (PVs) infect the epithelia of animals and man, where they generally induce benign proliferation at the site of infection. However, there is a strong association between malignant progression of human genital lesions and certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types, most frequently HPV 16. Our research is primarily concerned with development of vaccines and other infection inhibition strategies against HPV and the elucidation of the PV life cycle. We have developed a simple and efficient strategy for generating high titers of infectious papillomavirus particles that transduce encapsidated marker plasmids, i.e. pseudovirions. We have exploited this technology in our basic virologic and translational research efforts. We have used our pseudovirus technology to develop the first cervicovaginal challenge model for HPVs. We found that the infection of the female mouse genital tract, even of monolayer endocervical cells, requires exposure the basement membrane to the virus. The capsids bind avidly to the basement membrane but not to the apical surfaces of intact columnar or stratified squamous epithelia. Using a quantitative assay based on whole tissue fluorecence imaging after infection with red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing pseudovirions, we determined that nonoxynol-9 (N-9) and Conceptrol, an over the counter spermacide that containing N-9, dramatically potentiate in vivo papillomavirus infection, presumably due to it's ability to permeablize the epithelial layers and thereby expose the basement membrane to the virus. Interesting, no infection was detected if nonoxynol-9 was formulated in carrageenan rather than its normal gelling agent. Carrageenan is an algal polysaccharide widely used in processed food and cosmetics and is the main gelling agent in some over-the-counter lubricants. The results suggest that women using N-9 spermacides may be at increased risk of acquiring genital HPV infection and that this risk might be mitigated by reformulation of N-9 in a carrageenan based gel. Two NCI-sponsored clinical trial of carrageenan as a microbicide to prevent genital HPV infection in young women will soon commence, and we will collaborate on technical aspects of the trials. Our mouse cervicovaginal studies suggested that other interventions that compromise the integrity of the genital epithelium might potentiate HPV infection. Acquisition of ecto- and endocervical cells for cytology (Pap) screening disrupts the epithelium by design. Therefore we sought to determine whether the cytology specimen (Pap smear) collection procedure renders the cervix more susceptible to HPV infection in a rhesus macaque model. We found that the Pap smear collection procedure greatly potentiated infection by RFP expressing HPV16 pseudovirus. However, use of a carrageenan gel rather than Surgilube as the lubricant used for the internal digital exam after specimen collection largely abrogated the infection enhancing effect. These findings suggest that cytology screening in women might lead to a transient enhancement of susceptibility to HPV infection and that use of a carrageenan-based gel during the examine might mitigate this enhancement. The pseudovirus-based mouse cerviovaginal challenge model is also being used to explore the basic features of papillomavirus infection and the mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization of the virus in the female reproductive tract. We have determined that, in a process unique to papillomaviruses, the initial steps in infection occur after initial binding to heperan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) on the basement membrane, prior cell surface binding. Specifically the virions undergo a conformational change that exposes the N-terminus of the L2 minor capsid protein to cleavage by furin, a cellular protease that we detect in abundance at the sites of infection in vivo. This cleavage in turns leads to exposure of highly conserved L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes that are immediately downstream of the cleavage site. Blocking HSPG interactions or furin cleavage prevented cerviovaginal infection. In a process that takes several hours, the virions transfer from the basement membrane to the surface of keratinocytes invading the site of trauma, and the virions are then internalized. We have further determined that antibodies induced by L1 VLP vaccines (of type that are how commercially available) and L2 vaccines (which we developing as a more broadly cross type-neutralizing alternative) block in vivo infection by distinct mechanisms. L1 VLP antibodies block binding to the basement membrane, but allow binding to the keratinocytes. However, the L2 cross-neutralizing epitopes are not exposed and the virions are not internalized. L2 antibodies that broadly cross-neutralize HPV types permit the initial virion binding to the basement membrane HSPG. However, the virions are not detected in the tissue at later time points, suggesting that the L2 antibodies prevent stable transfer to the keratinocytes. These studies may well provide the most detailed mechanistic understanding of how a virus, in a living mammalian host, infects its relevant tissue and how vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies prevent infection in vivo. In vitro neutralizing assays we developed for L1 VLP vaccine analysis have proven to be insensitive for L2. Based on understanding of the in vivo infectious process, we have recently developed novel in vitro neutralizing assay that are 1000-fold more sensitive measure of L2 antibody activity. Our development of a method to induce efficient HPV pseudovirus infection of the female genital tract after transient disruption with N-9 has proven to be the key to our recent development of an effective intravaginal vaccination strategy. In patent pending studies, we have found that intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination of N-9 treated mice induces strong systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to target antigens transduced by the pseudovirions. Systemic responses rival those induced by previously optimized Ad5 vectors. Intravaginal responses are remarkably strong, with up to 80% of all intravaginal CD8 T cells staining tetramer positive for the targeted antigen. Most of the induced T appear to be intraepithelial and high level of effector memory CD8 T cells are maintained in the vaginal tract 100 days after vaccination. Intravaginal pseudovirus vaccination is a promising approach for focusing immune responses to the female genital tract and so might increase the effectiveness of vaccines directed against HSV and HIV infections and against HPV induced neoplasia. This concept is now being testing in an SIV/rhesus macaque intravaginal challenge model in collaboration with Dr. Franchini. To more generally evaluate the potential of HPV pseudoviruses as gene transfer vehicles, we have conducted a broad infection tropism survey. In patent pending studies, we demonstrated that intact murine epithelium at all sites, whether simple, columnar, or squamous, was highly resistant to both virion binding and infection, whereas disrupted epithelium was susceptible. In contrast, virtually all human-derived epithelial cell lines in the NC1-60 panel were highly susceptible to infection in vitro. The remarkable specificity of HPV pseudovirus binding and infection suggests that they may be useful in tumor diagnostic or cytotoxic gene therapy applications. In proof of concept studies, we documented highly specific binding and infection, and dramatic imaging, of human ovarian tumor nodules implanted in nude mouse peritoneum after intraperitoneal injection of RFP-expressing pseudovirus. In a preliminarly study using a mouse model of ovarian metastases, intraperitoneal injection of Herpes TK-expressing HPV psuedovirions followed by ganciclovir treatment, increased survival of tumor bearing mice.\",\n",
       " \"The RNA Viruses Section entered into a CRADA with MedImmune in 2006 to develop live attenuated vaccines against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and human parainfluena viruses (HPIV3) serotypes 1, 2, and 3. These vaccines are intended for intranasal administration to infants and young children. The first priority is to develop a bivalent vaccine against RSV-A and HPIV3, the two more prevalent and important viruses in this group. It is expected that immunization with RSV-A will provide substantial cross-protection against RSV-B. Secondary objectives are to develop live-attenuated vaccines against RSV-B, HMPV, and HPIV1 and 2. Vaccine virus candidates are generated from cDNA by reverse genetics, providing well-defined vaccines. Stepwise clinical evaluation begins in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), followed by seropositive older children (typically 15-59 months of age), followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -59 months of age). In some cases, viruses are evaluated in young infants, typically 1-3 months of age. The following is a summary of the studies to date.RSV-A vaccine:  Under the CRADA, Medimmune is conducting a Phase 1/2a immunogenicity study in young infants with a recombinant rRSV (called rA2cp248/404/1030delSH or Medi-559) that contains a set of five independent attenuating mutations.  In a previous phase 1 study by LID,  this virus was well-tolerated and immunogenic in 1-2 month old infants. The purpose of the present study is to get further data on safety and immunogenicity. LID also has initiated a clinical study of a live attenuated rRSV bearing deletion of the M2-2 coding sequence (Medi delM2-2). This virus exhibits up-regulated gene expression that may increase its immunogenicity. Manufacturing is in progress for a vaccine candidate containing a deletion in the NS1 gene. Other candidates are in pre-clinical development.HPIV3 vaccine: There are two HPIV3 vaccine candidates in ongoing clinical trials.  (i) The first is rB/HPIV3, which is recombinant chimera consisting of bovine PIV3 (BPIV3) in which the F and HN protective antigen genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3. The BPIV3 backbone provides a host-range attenuation phenotype to which each of the genes contributes. In unscreened adults (N =15) and seropositive older children (N = 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1), there was minimal shedding and no difference in illness between vaccinees and placebo recipients. In seronegative children of 6 to 36 months of age (N = 21, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1), the vaccine infected all recipients, replicated to low level (mean peak titer 2.8 log10 pfu/ml), was well-tolerated, and induced a &#8805;4-fold rise in serum antibodies in 93% of the recipients.  This, rB/HPIV3 is a promising vaccine candidate. (ii) The second HPIV3 candidate is rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that previously had been found by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons, and the attenuating mutations were identified as described in previous reports. The vaccine was evaluated in a 2-dose, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 6-12 month old serologically-unscreened infants. 12 of the 15 infants receiving the first dose shed vaccine virus at low-to-moderate titers, and there was no difference in illness between vaccine and placebo recipients. 10 of 15 vaccinated children and none of the 8 placebo recipients had a 4-fold or greater rise in virus-specific serum antibody titer. Of the 5 vaccinated infants who did not respond serologically, each was found to have pre-existing serum antibodies to HPIV3Following the second dose, given after a mean interval of 6 weeks, only 1 of 15 vaccinees shed vaccine virus; this individual was asymptomatic. 13% of recipients of the second dose had respiratory or febrile illness, compared to 63% of the second dose placebo group. None of the vaccinees or placebo recipients had a 4-fold rise in virus-specific serum antibody titer following the second dose. This indicates that the vaccine indeed induced protection against HPIV3 infection, and that a longer interval between doses may be needed to obtain a boosting effect. This protocol was amended to include screening to ensure that the infants are HPIV3-seronegative prior to immunzation, and the age group was expanded to include infants and children ages 6 to 36 months. In addition, nasal washes for viral assay were collected only in the case of respiratory or febrile illness. 21 additional subjects were enrolled, receiving vaccine or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in a double-blinded fashion. The incidence of respiratory or febrile illness was the same in the vaccine and placebo recipients. 4-fold or greater rises in HPIV3-specific serum antibody were observed in 79% and 14% of vaccinees following the first and second dose, respectively. 86% of vaccinees had a 4-fold or greater rise following either dose. In general, this study indicated that the cDNA-derived vaccine material was equivalent to its biologically-derived parent, and thus represents a promising vaccine candidate that should be evaluated further.Under a separate protocol, the effect of increasing the interval between the 2 doses to 6 months is presently being evaluated in companion protocols through Seattle Children's Hospital and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. A total of 40 children have been enrolled. This study should provide information that will help determine the dosing schedule for a phase 2b study.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that is attenuated by defined mutations including ones that have been engineered for genetic stability. This virus was immunogenic and protective in African green monkeys (AGMs). When given to 35 unscreened healthy adult volunteers, only 4 individuals were infected and shedding was minimal and with no illness, which is the desired safety profile for an attenuated virus. When evaluated in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (double-blind, 10 vaccine recipients and 5 placebo), none of the vaccinees were detectably infected, consistent with a highly attenuated nature. The vaccine presently is being evaluated in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (N = 30, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). Results are incomplete but indicate that vaccine virus infectivity and shedding were low. HPIV2 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated intranasal HPIV2 vaccine called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that, like the HPIV1 candidate, included stabilized mutations. This virus was immunogenic and protective in AGMs. When given to 15 seropositive adult volunteers, only 4 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts. The virus is presently being evaluated in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (N = 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). HMPV vaccine: LID has initiated the first HMPV vaccine clinical study to be reported. This involves a live-attenuated HMPV vaccine virus (rHMPV-Pa) in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. This virus has been administered to 15 healthy adults, with the result that there was no detectable HMPV infection or shedding, consistent with this being a highly attenuated virus.\",\n",
       " \"The goal of this contract is to provide support of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) hazard assessment activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents. An overall goal is for the National Toxicology Program's Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) and the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) to assume a greater leadership role in promoting research, development, translation, validation, and regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods. The NICEATM-ICCVAM five-year plan builds on the ICCVAM mission of facilitating the development, validation, and regulatory acceptance of new and revised regulatory test methods that reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in testing while maintaining and promoting scientific quality and the protection of human health, animal health, and the environment. The mission, vision, and strategic priorities will help NICEATM and ICCVAM achieve greater progress and inform the public of their plans and approaches. The plan also builds on the NTP's Roadmap for the 21st Century that includes the goal of developing and validating improved testing methods and, where scientifically feasible, to ensure that these methods reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals. The Roadmap also specifies that activities and assays developed under the NTP Roadmap will be conducted in cooperation and consultation with ICCVAM to maximize their value to regulatory agencies. U.S. regulatory agencies are charged with protecting human and animal health and the environment. As part of this mission, agencies need to determine whether adverse effects might result from exposures to substances such as pesticides, consumer products, medicines, medical devices, workplace chemicals, food additives, or to contaminants in air, food, or water. Many of the current test methods for evaluating hazard and risk assessments from exposure to such substances use laboratory animals. Federal agencies require that all test methods should be based on sound science. According to the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000, new, revised, and alternative test methods must be determined to be valid for their proposed use before agencies can adopt them for regulatory purposes. Validation is required to determine if the use of an alternative test method, compared to current methods or approaches, can provide equal or better protection of human and animal health and the environment. In the United States, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) coordinates interagency issues on alternative toxicological test method development, validation, regulatory acceptance, and national and international harmonization. The committee is responsible for coordinating Federal interagency technical evaluations of new, revised, and alternative safety testing methods and forwarding test method recommendations to U.S. Federal agencies. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences originally established ICCVAM in 1997. In 2000, ICCVAM was established by law as a permanent interagency committee of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences under the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods. ICCVAM is composed of representatives from the 15 U.S. Federal regulatory and research agencies that require, use, or generate toxicological testing data and information.  NICEATM administers ICCVAM and provides scientific and operational support for ICCVAM activities. NICEATM also conducts and coordinates international validation studies to evaluate the usefulness and limitations of potential new alternative test methods. NICEATM and ICCVAM work together to evaluate and promote the validation and regulatory acceptance of scientifically valid toxicological test methods based on sound science that will protect human and animal health and the environment, while reducing, refining (decreasing pain and distress), and replacing animal use where scientifically feasible. NICEATM and ICCVAM provide an essential framework for translating advances in science and technology into standardized and adequately validated safety testing methods that can be used to protect and advance public health. Since its establishment in 1997, ICCVAM has coordinated or contributed to the evaluation of 27 alternative test methods that have been accepted or endorsed by national and international authorities. The types of safety testing and available alternatives include: eye irritation and injury, acute systemic toxicity, dermal absorption, dermal corrosivity and irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, pyrogenicity, and vaccine potency. The alternative methods accepted by Federal agencies include 17 non-animal methods and 10 methods that use fewer animals and/or provide for refinement by reducing or avoiding potential discomfort. Most of the in vitro methods do not require the use of animals when positive results are obtained. Recommendations for additional alternatives for allergic contact dermatitis and ocular irritation are in development. In response to requests from the Appropriations Committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, ICCVAM and NICEATM prepared a five-year plan to describe goals and objectives for the years 2008 through 2012. This plan was developed in conjunction with Federal agency program offices and describes how NICEATM and ICCVAM will promote the research, development, translation, validation, and regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods that reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in testing while maintaining scientific quality and protecting human health, animal health, and the environment. The plan identified four key challenges that NICEATM and ICCVAM will address in conjunction with agency programs. The first challenge is to identify priority toxicity testing areas for the next five years and to conduct and facilitate activities in those areas. Currently, the four highest priority areas are ocular toxicity, dermal toxicity, acute systemic toxicity, and biologics potency and safety testing. These are based on the potential for these tests to cause animal pain and distress and the fact that these are the most commonly conducted safety tests. Other priority areas include immunotoxicity, endocrine disruptors, pyrogenicity, reproductive and developmental, and chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity testing. The second challenge is to identify and promote research initiatives that are expected to support future development of innovative alternative test methods. These new methods might incorporate techniques such as high throughput screening, computer modeling, informatics, and biomarkers. The third challenge is for NICEATM and ICCVAM to foster the acceptance and appropriate use of alternative test methods through outreach and communication. This will be accomplished by sponsoring and participating in workshops, NICEATM-ICCVAM website communications, and the development and publication of standardized test method protocols. Lastly, ICCVAM and NICEATM will develop partnerships and strengthen interactions with stakeholders to facilitate meaningful progress. These efforts are expected to facilitate research, development, translation, validation and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods that will reduce, refine, and replace animal use while maintaining scientific quality and the protection of human health, animal health, and the environment. In June 2009, ICCVAM and NICEATM released an Implementation Plan for the NICEATM-ICCVAM Five-Year Plan. This working document describes how ICCVAM and NICEATM are implementing the strategies outlined in the Five-Year Plan and includes goals, specific objectives, and planned activities for implementation. The Implementation Plan also describes NICEATM and ICCVAM accomplishments since February 2008 that relate to the goals and objectives outlined in the Implementation Plan. NICEATM and ICCVAM recently created an alternative test methods milestones page on the NICEATM-ICCVAM website to provide a comprehensive overview of available alternative methods and a quick summary of current validation and evaluation activities, (http:// http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/methods/milestones.htm.). The page provides a comprehensive summary of the status of ongoing and completed NICEATM-ICCVAM alternative test method evaluation projects and projects to which NICEATM, ICCVAM, and agency scientists are contributing. The page also provides timelines for each project with links to more detailed information and relevant documents. Additional information about NICEATM and ICCVAM test method evaluation activities can be found at http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov/. On April 27, 2009, representatives of the United States, the European Union, Canada, and Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation for International Cooperation on Alternative Test Methods (ICATM). The agreement provides a framework for enhanced international cooperation, collaboration, and communication in three critical areas: (1) test method validation studies, independent peer review of the validation status of test methods, and the development of harmonized formal test method recommendations for regulatory authorities The initial participating validation organizations are the NICEATM and ICCVAM, the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (JaCVAM), the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and the Environmental Health Science and Safety Bureau within Health Canada. The cooperation among these organizations facilitated by this agreement is expected to accelerate international adoption of scientifically valid alternative test methods. NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an international independent scientific peer review panel in 2008 and 2009 to review several new versions and applications of the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA), an alternative test method for assessing the allergic contact dermatitis potential of chemicals and products. ICCVAM originally evaluated the scientific validity of the LLNA in 1998. U.S. Federal agencies accepted the ICCVAM recommendations that the LLNA was a valid substitute for the current guinea pig test method used to assess the allergic contact dermatitis and that it could be used to evaluate most but not all types of substances. ICCVAM also concluded that the LLNA has many advantages over the traditional test methods, including using fewer animals, eliminating the potential discomfort that can occur from substances that are sensitizers, and providing dose-response information. The LLNA was subsequently incorporated into national and international test guidelines for the assessment of skin sensitization.  Accidental eye injury is a leading cause of visual impairment in the U.S., and many of these injuries occur due to contact with workplace or household chemicals. According to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), each day about 2000 U.S. workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical treatment. Even more eye injuries occur in the home; with about 125,000 eye injuries a year caused by accidents involving common household products such as oven cleaner and bleach (source, American Academy of Ophthalmology). Federal agencies require safety testing to determine whether consumer products or other substances may cause temporary or permanent damage to the eye. In October 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominated four in vitro ocular toxicity test methods for evaluation as potential screening methods for eye corrosion or severe irritation. Ocular safety testing is one of ICCVAM's top four priorities because it is one of the four most common safety tests required and therefore involves significant number of animals. Such testing also has the potential to cause significant unrelieved pain and distress when chemicals and products cause eye damage. In 2008, two ICCVAM-recommended in vitro safety testing methods, the bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) and isolated chicken eye (ICE) test methods, were accepted by U.S. Federal agencies for identifying substances with the potential to cause severe or permanent damage to eyes without using live animals. The OECD Council formally adopted TGs for these test methods in 2009, with the BCOP described in TG 437 and the ICE in TG 438. These methods can now be used worldwide to identify substances that may cause severe or irreversible eye damage. Positive results can be used for hazard classification without the need to use live animals, thereby avoiding the pain and distress that may have resulted if animals had been required. NICEATM and ICCVAM organized an international independent scientific peer review panel that met in May 2009 to evaluate nine alternative methods and strategies for ocular safety testing. These included: ¿ The routine use of topical anesthetics, systemic analgesics, and humane endpoints to avoid and minimize pain and distress during in vivo ocular irritation testing. ¿ The use of the BCOP, the Cytosensor(R) Microphysiometer (CM), the ICE, the isolated rabbit eye, and the hen's egg test ¿ chorioallantoic membrane test methods for identifying moderate and mild ocular irritants and for identifying substances that do not cause sufficient eye injury to require ocular hazard labeling (non-labeled category). ¿ The in vivo low volume eye test. ¿ Non-animal testing strategies using the BCOP, CM, and/or EpiOcular¿ test methods to assess the eye irritation potential of antimicrobial cleaning products and to determine their appropriate U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ocular hazard classification.  Highlights of the Panel's conclusions and recommendations include: ¿ Topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics should routinely be used prior to all in vivo ocular irritancy testing. The Panel recommended an enhanced protocol of specific pain-relieving drugs and schedule of administration to effectively avoid or minimize discomfort. ¿ The BCOP and CM test methods could be used as screening tests to identify some products and substances that would not require hazard labeling for eye irritation. These methods will now be recommended for use in a ¿bottom-up testing approach¿ to identify substances that are not expected to cause sufficient injury to require classification as an ocular irritation hazard. ¿ Proposed non-animal testing strategies using three in vitro test methods to assess the eye irritation potential of antimicrobial cleaning products for EPA ocular hazard classification and labeling purposes appear promising. The Panel recommended that studies should be conducted to further characterize the in vitro test methods and that testing strategies should be designed in coordination with ICCVAM.\",\n",
       " 'Mosquito-borne members of the family Bunyaviridae are recognized as a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America with 70-130 symptomatic cases each year.  Clinically important viruses include La Crosse virus (LACV) and Jamestown Canyon (JCV) in the US, and Tahyna virus (TAHV) in Europe. The majority of LACV infections are mild and never reported, however, serologic studies estimate infection rates of 10-30/100,000 in endemic areas. LACV encephalitis has become the most commonly reported pediatric arboviral encephalitis in the US with 70-130 symptomatic cases a year with severe sequelae. For these reasons we are interested in developing a vaccine to prevent this CNS disease. LACV sequence analysis: To better understand the genetic factors contributing to disease, the full genome sequence of the five known human isolates of LACV and of 13 mosquito isolates was analyzed, and a high level of genetic relatedness amongst the 18 viruses was observed.  Two major LACV genetic groupings were identified that had allelic differences in the S, M and L genome segments. Group 1 viruses were underrepresented in mosquitoes (1 of 13 isolates) but predominant in humans (4 of 5 isolates), while Group 2 viruses were isolated predominantly from mosquitoes.  The presence of Group 1 viruses in 80% of humans with severe central nervous system (CNS) disease suggested that Group 1 viruses possess a higher encephalitogenic potential than Group 2 viruses. To explore this hypothesis, viruses from both genetic groups were analyzed for their neurovirulent phenotype in mice, and a representative virus from each genetic group was analyzed in nonhuman primates. Whereas the viruses from both genetic groups exhibited somewhat similar neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in mice, the primate model demonstrated that Group 1 human virus possesses higher neurovirulence, as defined by greater levels of virus replication in the CNS and more severe virus-induced neuroinflammation. This study confirms the observation that Group 1 LACV is more likely to be associated with CNS disease. Therefore, the low incidence of encephalitis due to LACV infection in humans may be partially explained by the observed low frequency of neurovirulent Group 1 LACV among mosquitoes.  Conversely, the greater prevalence of less pathogenic Group 2 LACV in mosquito populations may account for the asymptomatic or mild nature of the majority of LACV infections in humans. A detailed study of the neuropathogenesis of LACV for the CNS of non-human primates is ongoing.JCV sequence analysis: We have completed the sequence of three isolates of JCV collected in geographically diverse locations over a 57 year time span.  The nucleotide identity for the three JCV viruses is 90, 83, and 85% for the S, M, and L segments, respectively ,whereas the percent identify for the predicted amino acid sequences of the N, NSS, M poly, GN, NSM, GC, and L proteins is 97, 91, 94, 98, 91, 94, and 97%, respectively.  In Swiss Webster mice, each JCV isolate exhibits low neuroinvasiveness but high infectivity.  Two of the three JCV isolates were highly neurovirulent after IC inoculation whereas one isolate, JCV/03/CT, exhibited low neurovirulence.  In rhesus monkeys, JCV infection is accompanied by a lack of clinical disease, a low-titered viremia, and a robust neutralizing antibody response. A relatively high level of amino acid sequence conservation was observed even for viruses isolated 57 years apart indicating that the virus is in relative evolutionary stasis. JCV is highly infectious for mice and monkeys, and these animals, especially mice, represent useful experimental hosts for further study.TAHV sequence analysis: In order to determine the genomic sequence of wild-type TAHV, we chose three geographically distinct TAHV isolates isolated over a 26-year period and are the first to determine the complete sequence of the TAHV S, M, and L segments.  TAHV maintains a highly conserved genome with both nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity greater than 99%.  In order to determine the extent of genetic relatedness to other members of the CEV serogroup, we compared protein sequences of TAHV with LACV, Snowshoe Hare virus (SSHV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), and Inkoo virus (INKV).  By amino acid comparison, TAHV was most similar to SSHV followed by LACV, JCV, and INKV.  The sequence of the GN protein is most conserved followed by L, N, GC, NSS, and NSM.  In a weanling Swiss Webster mouse model, all three TAHV isolates were uniformly neurovirulent, but only one virus was neuroinvasive.  In rhesus monkeys, the virus was highly immunogenic even in the absence of viremia. Cross neutralization studies utilizing monkey immune serum demonstrated that TAHV is antigenically distinct from North American viruses LACV and JCV. However, we have also demonstrated significant cross-neutralization which may complicate virus identification since anti-JCV serum neutralized both LACV and TAHV.  These data also suggest that a single vaccine could generate a cross-neutralizing antibody response which may provide protection against CEV serogroup viruses from a wide geographic range.Vaccine development: Given our experience with antigenic chimeric viruses of the various flaviviruses, we sought to explore the possibility that we could use an attenuated LACV as a backbone to create antigenic chimeric viruses in which the coding region of the M segment of LACV is replaced with that of a second bunyavirus. In our efforts to create live-attenuated viral vaccine candidates for this virus group, we have generated a recombinant La Crosse virus expressing the attachment glycoproteins of Jamestown Canyon virus.  The JCV/LACV chimeric virus contains full-length S and L segments derived from LACV.  In the M segment, the ORF of LACV is replaced with that derived from JCV and is flanked by the non-coding regions of LACV.  Chimerization did not affect the growth of the chimeric virus in tissue culture, and the virus remains highly infectious and immunogenic in Swiss Webster mice.  Although both LACV and JCV parental viruses are highly neurovirulent in 21 day-old mice, with LD50 values (log10 PFU) of 0.1 and 0.5 respectively, chimeric JCV/LACV is highly attenuated and does not cause disease even after intracerebral inoculation of 3 log10 PFU.  Parenteral vaccination of mice with 3 log10 PFU of JCV/LACV protected against lethal challenge with LACV, JCV, and Tahyna virus (TAHV).  The chimeric virus was infectious and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys and protected against the development of viremia after JCV challenge. The use of the LACV genetic background to deliver M segment protective antigens from pathogenic Bunyaviruses other than JCV could be an efficient method for rapid development of vaccines effective against pathogenic bunyaviruses, including Rift Valley fever virus and Hantavirus.',\n",
       " 'Ongoing research focuses on the exploration of pathologic inflammatory responses to acute respiratory virus infection and the use of this information to develop creative strategies to circumvent these lethal sequelae characteristic of this disease.We report on two primary studies and two collaborations:Our first study addresses a novel and interesting observation - specifically, that wild-type mice primed via intranasal inoculation with one of two strains of gram-positive Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus reuteri) were completely protected against lethal sequelae of infection with the virulent rodent pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice. Significant protection against lethal virus infection persisted for at least 5 months after the initial priming. Priming with live lactobacilli resulted in diminished granulocyte recruitment, diminished expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL10, CXCL1, CCL2, and TNF), and diminished virus recovery, although it is interesting to note that absolute virus titer did not predict clinical outcome. Lactobacillus priming also resulted in prolonged survival and protection against the lethal sequelae of pneumonia virus of mice infection in MyD88 gene-deleted mice, suggesting that the protective mechanisms may be TLR-independent. Overall, we have identified and characterized an effective Lactobacillus-mediated innate immune shield, which may ultimately serve as critical and long-term protection against infection in the absence of specific antiviral vaccines.  (Gabryszewski SJ, Bachar O, Dyer KD, Percopo CM, Killoran KE, Domachowske JB, Rosenberg HF.  2011.  Lactobacillus-mediated priming of the respiratory mucosa protects against lethal pneumovirus infection.  J Immunol. 186:1151-61.)   The second study emerged from the work of a colleague and now collaborator, Dr. Edward Dubovi, head of Veterinary Virology at Cornell University.  Dr. Dubovi and his group described the isolation of a pneumovirus from the nasal washings of shelter-bound dogs that bore remarkable similarity (90-95% amino acid sequence) to pneumonia virus of mice (PVM).  We then showed that this new pneumovirus, CnPnV, perhaps not surprisingly, replicates in bronchial epithelial cells in the lung tissue of BALB/c mice; sera from mice that recover from CnPnV infection contain antibodies that cross-react with and protect mice against subsequent PVM disease.  But the most interesting part was the dramatic attenuation of the virus isolated from the wild; in contrast to PVM J3666 infection, fatal CnPnV infections were observed only in response to 1000-fold higher intranasal inocula.  Dr. Dubovi has since isolated 20 additional related unique-sequence pneumoviruses from shelter-bound dogs and cats, which are available for further evaluation. This provides us with the invaluable opportunity to explore the molecular basis of the acute antiviral inflammatory response and to examine gene and virus-protein specific structure-function correlates. (Percopo CM, Dubovi EJ, Renshaw RW, Dyer KD, Domachowske JB, Rosenberg HF.  2011.  Canine pneumovirus (CnPnV) replicates in mouse lung tissue and elicits inflammatory pathology.  Virology 416:26-31.)We have also contributed to two collaborative studies.  The first of these is a clinical study under the lead of my long-time collaborator, Dr. Joseph Domachowske, Professor of Microbiology, Immunology and Pediatrics at SUNY Upstate Medical Unversity, Syracuse, NY.  The results are from a 3-year prospective study of children younger than 24 months hospitalized with a febrile respiratory illness. This study focuses on the question of co-morbidities and investigated whether virus-virus or virus-Bordetella co-infections are more frequent or more severe than previously recognized.  Virus pathogens and Bordetella infections were detected on nasal swab or washes were evaluated by PCR, multiplex PCR and/or culture.  Interestingly, of the 201 pediatric patients enrolled, respiratory viruses were detected in 187 (93%) patients (typically RSV, rhinovirus/enterovirus); 52 (28%) were diagnosed with multi-pathogen infections.  Most striking, clinical symptoms in individuals with multi-pathogen infections were no greater than in those with a single pathogen infection. (Suryadevara M, Cummings E, Bonville CA, Bartholoma N, Riddell S, Kiska D, Rosenberg HF, Domachowske JB.  2011.  Viral etiology of acute febrile respiratory illnesses in hospitalized children less than twenty-four months of age.  Clin. Peds. 50:513-7.)   The second collaborative study was performed in conjunction with another long-time collaborator, Dr. Paul S. Foster, Professor at the School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Australia.  In this study, we shared our expertise with the PVM infection model, and used it to explore the role of toll-like receptors (TLR) in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory virus infection, specifically, the contribution of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and TLR7 signaling to the development of the innate inflammatory and early adaptive immune responses. Among our findings, in wild-type, but not TLR7- or MyD88-gene-deleted mice, PVM inoculation led to a marked infiltration of pDC and increased expression of type I, II, and III IFNs.  In the absence of TLR7, PVM-specific CD8 T cell cytokine production was eliminated. The adoptive transfer of TLR7-sufficient, but not TLR7-deficient pDC to TLR7 gene-deleted mice recapitulated the antiviral responses observed in wild-type mice and promoted virus clearance.  Overall, the results indicated that TLR7-mediated signaling by pDC is required for appropriate innate responses to acute pneumovirus infection.

       " \"Acute or chronic non-A, B, C, D, E hepatitis is being studied for biological, serological or molecular evidence of transmissible agents. Fulminant non-A to E hepatitis remains a diagnostic enigma and may represent one or more previously unrecognized diseases. We are attempting to discover the etiology of this disease. Evidence for the existence of an additional water-borne hepatitis virus has come from our seroepidemiologic studies in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Hepatitis E virus may be emerging as a greater public health problem than previously thought.  We are studying its epidemiology in developing and industrialized countries worldwide. Serologic evidence of infection of swine with hepatitis E virus (HEV) was obtained. A new and unique HEV strain was recovered from infected swine and characterized.  It was shown to have a worldwide distribution. Seroepidemiological studies of swine handlers and matched blood donors have shown an excess of antibody to HEV in swine handlers, suggesting that the virus may be zoonotically spread. In addition, throughout FY 2009 and 2010, we have been evaluating the significance of antibody to HEV (anti-HEV) in domestic animals that are part of the human food chain, especially cattle, sheep and goats.  Anti-HEV has been found in all of the species, although not to the extent that it is found in swine.  Rarely, swine are an important zoonotic source of hepatitis E, especially in industrialized countries, but these don't account for the high prevalence of anti-HEV in Islamic and Jewish cultures.  In collaboration with XJ Meng, we are determining the susceptibility of goats to infection with the recognized HEV strains and attempting to recover HEV-like agents from young goats that are being intensively monitored for serologic and molecular evidence of infection.  Similar serologic evidence for infection of wild rats with HEV has also been obtained and the infecting agent has been identified. To date we have successfully transmitted the agent from rats trapped in Los Angeles to laboratory rats of the same species (Rattus norvegicus). However, transmission was difficult, suggesting that the virus replicates at low titer. In 2010, using PCR primers developed for detecting a new rat HEV in Germany, we were able to recover sequence from the Los Angeles strain of rat HEV that we had transmitted to other rats previously.  The sequence was very similar to the sequence of rat HEV recovered in Germany.  We have confirmed transmission of rat HEV to other rats and we have determined both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of rat HEV in several clinical samples from infected rats, including feces, serum and liver tissue.  We have documented that both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of the virus is relatively low in these clinical materials, thus providing an explanation for difficulty in consistent transmission.  We have also confirmed by PCR that human strains of HEV were not transmissible to laboratory rats and that the rat HEV was not transmissible to rhesus monkeys, a surrogate of man.  The low virus titers detected in rats, the difficulty in transmitting the virus to rats and the inability to transmit the rat virus to a nonhuman primate species that is susceptible to infection by human and swine HEV strains leads us to conclude that the rat virus probably does not pose a threat of zoonotic infection to humans.Modern techniques of molecular biology have been used to discover new viruses in recent years. These are now being applied to sera from patients with transfusion-associated or community-acquired hepatitis in a search for new hepatitis viruses that may cause up to 2% of such hepatitis in the US and up to one-third of hepatitis in developing countries. In addition, a significant number of cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer remain undiagnosed.  In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of virus discovery, we are applying microarray technology to attempts to transmit new agents to chimpanzees, the only species other than man that is susceptible to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses. Preliminary results are promising. Similarly, approximately one half of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases have no recognized etiology.  In collaboration with the Epidemiology Section, LID, we are applying the same approaches to attempts to identify new gastroenteritis agents. In FY 2009, while evaluating the innate and adaptive immune responses of chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV), we discovered an aberrant innate immune response in two chimpanzees that had been infected with HEV from an outbreak of hepatitis E in Pakistan.  Based on extensive experience with innate and adaptive immune responses to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses in chimpanzees, we postulated that the response in these animals was to a second agent replicating in the liver.  By attempting transmission from the second innate immune response episode to new chimpanzees, we demonstrated evidence for an infection not related to hepatitis E in the original infection.  It has been associated with only minor biochemical evidence of hepatitis, but that is also true for HEV infection of chimpanzees.  We plan to determine if this putative agent produces more severe infection on serial passage and whether it can be associated with hepatitis or other liver disease, such as liver cancer.  Liver cancer is a common sequela of infection with three of the five recognized human hepatitis viruses.In 2010, we attempted to identify an etiologic agent in clinical materials from one of the chimpanzees with evidence of infection with a possible new hepatitis agent.  Clinical samples were tested on the  virus Chip  being utilized at the time under the NCI contract with SAIC.  Although, based on sequences detected, several viruses were found to be infecting the chimpanzee, none was found to be unique to the acute phase sample but not the pre-infection sample.  Subsequently, both pre-infection and acute phase plasma samples from the chimpanzee were subjected to  next-generation  deep sequencing with  454 technology.  Both sequences of known virus families (in some cases the same as those detected by the virus Chip) and unique sequences were detected.  These are currently being subjected to in-depth analysis to determine if they include one or more previously unrecognized viruses.In 2011 we have continued to refine extraction and amplification techniques for the identification of new hepatitis viruses from primate-derived clinical materials, in anticipation of additional  next-generation  sequencing experiments.  Known viruses of known titer have been used as controls to optimize procedures.In other collaborative studies, the epidemiology of emerging norovirus infections among children were studied in stored clinical samples obtained between 1975 and 1991.  Evolutionary analysis revealed that norovirus genotype GII.3 viruses evolved at a rate comparable to that of other small RNA viruses and that these viruses evolve at a relatively steady state.  Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of prevalent noroviruses is relevant to the development of effective prevention and control strategies.\",\n",
       " 'Approach 1: Understand and improve on the protective efficacy of ALVAC & gp120 vaccination. In the last several years we have investigated vaccine approaches for HIV, based on DNA alone or in combination with poxvirus-based vaccines, and found that these vaccine modalities are able to elicit mainly memory T-cells, and when combined with gp120 protein boost can induce high titer binding antibodies. A similar strategy using the canary pox vector ALVAC in combination with gp120 was used in the recently completed RV144 trial in Thailand that showed marginal efficacy (31.2%) [Jim Tartalia NejM 2009]. The relative efficacy of similar vaccine modalities varied in animal models dependent on co-receptor usage of the virus used in challenge experiments, the viral strain, the age of the animals, and the route and dose of exposure. Recent evidence suggest that the dose of challenge exposure to SIVmac251, a CCR5 user virus, affects the read out of vaccine efficacy and that at high doses of challenge exposure, vaccine protection is diminished and several virus variants are transmitted. It is estimated that in humans, the risk of HIV transmission ranges by different routes between ten and one thousand per encounter and that when transmission occurs, only few HIV variants pass the mucosa. We explored the relevance of the SIVmac251 macaque model to vaccine efficacy in humans by using vaccines similar to those used in the AIDSVAX or the RV144 trials, and by using a dose of SIVmac251 intended to transmit few viral variants to better mimic HIV mucosal transmission in humans. We found that, in these conditions, the animal model faithfully recapitulated the efficacy of these vaccine modalities in humans. Now that we have defined an appropriate model that recapitulates the protection we are designing studies aimed at defining the correlates of protection induced by ALVAC and gp120. In attempt to improve upon the immunogenicity of ALVAC and gp120 and to investigate the importance of challenge dose on evaluating vaccine efficacy. We evaluated the effect of varying the SIVmac251 challenge dose on vaccine efficacy after immunizing with combination of a DNA, ALVAC-SIV, and gp120.  The evaluation of vaccine efficacy in the non-human primate model for HIV has been often carried out using a single high dose challenge modality. While it is now clear that low repeated doses mucosal exposure to SIV/SHIV better recapitulate sexual transmission of HIV-1 in humans, it is still not known whether a relationship exists between viral inoculum size and vaccine efficacy. Thus, we investigated the impact of the mucosal challenge dose on the efficacy of DNA-SIV/ALVAC-SIV/ gp120 protein, a strategy similar to the Thai trial vaccine. For the first time, we have demonstrated that vaccine efficacy depends on the dose of challenge. In fact while vaccination transiently decreased viral replication after a single intra-rectal dose of 6100 TCID50, it protected 3 of the 12 macaques challenged with repeated low doses of 470 TCID50 SIVmac251. Vaccination also resulted in prolonged protection from high viral replication, reduction of the number of transmitted variants and systemic and mucosal CD4+ T cell regeneration in the animals exposed to 470 TCID50, but not to 6100 TCID50 SIVmac251. Interestingly, while the temporary protection observed in the high dose challenged group was correlated with CD8 T cell responses only, both antibodies and CD8 cell responses to gag and env participated to the prolonged protection from viral replication. Our data demonstrate the importance of accuratly modeling HIV transmission in macaques then evaluating of vaccine efficacy, with particular attention to the dose of exposure. Approach 2: Targeting the Vaginal Mucosa with Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirion Vaccines delivering SIV DNA The majority of HIV infections occur via sexual transmission. HIV must survive the genital tract, cross the vaginal or rectal epithelium and then disseminate throughout the body. The failure of current vaccine strategies at providing sterilizing immunity may be due to the quantity, quality or durability of vaccine induced responses at the portal of entry. Blocking vaginal transmission of HIV may require vaccines that target the female genital tract and induce local immunity. HIV vaccines based on viral vectors, proteins, or a combination thereof, tested in phase III vaccine efficacy trials in humans, induced mainly systemic immune responses using vaccines delivered by intramuscular inoculation. While these vaccine modalities induce variable levels of HIV-specific responses in the blood, little is known about their ability to induce mucosal responses. A subset of human papillomavirus (HPVs) are sexually transmitted mucosal pathogens that naturally infect cervico-vaginal keratinocytes. HPV-VLP-based vaccines are safe and very effective at preventing the HPV infections that cause cervical neoplasia in women. HPV capsid proteins, L1 and L2, can self assemble into virus like particles (VLPs) and, when co-transfected with a plasmid containing a gene of interest, L1 and L2 will encapsidate the plasmid forming pseudovirions (PsVs). Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) pseudovirions, is a technology developed by my collaborators, Drs Buck, Schiller, and Lowy, at the NCI. HPV PsVs have been shown to effectively deliver reporter genes to the female genital tract in multiple animal models. HPV PsVs infection is limited to keratinocytes and requires minor disruption of the epithelium. Expression of the transgene is robust but transient, lasting approximately seven days in the mouse genital tract. Furthermore, HPV PsVs may serve as adjuvants, engaging toll like receptors and facilitating the activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells.  We have exploited the ability of HPV PsVs to target the female genital tract and used PsVs as vectors to deliver DNA encoding SIV genes to a site of SIV transmission in two non-human primate species. We demonstrated that HPV PsVs, used as vehicles for the delivery of SIV DNA, induced SIVmac251 specific cellular and humoral immune responses at the genital tract, in the genital draining lymph nodes, and in blood in both cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. Intravaginal vaccination results in the recruitment of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to the site of vaccination, increasing the absolute number of T-cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa. In addition, HPV PsVs induced mucosal immune responses that rapidly expanded upon vaginal exposure to SIVmac251. We are currently investingating if HPV PsV induced immune responses can protect macaques from a repeated low dose vaginal challenge with SIVmac251. Approach 3: Induce effector T-cells in the gastrointestinal tract using heat shock gp96-Igbased SIV recombinant vaccines. This is part of a collaborative effort with Dr Podack from the University of Miami and includes the preparation of cellular SIV-gp96-vaccines secreted by 293 cells. This cell-based gp96-Ig vaccine has prolonged in vivo secretion of gp96-Ig-peptide that imitates viral replication and provide immune stimuli comparable to attenuated viruses. The vaccine is composed of transfected 293 cells that secrete ER-chaperone gp96-Ig in complex with SIV derived peptides. Strong rectal and vaginal CTL reponses are achieved by i.p. immunization of macaques with the gp96-Ig-SIV vaccine. In the past year we have found that coinjection of recombinant gp120 protein with the 293-gp96SIVIg-vaccine cells provides significant protection from rectal SIV infection. As neither gp96-SIV alone or gp120-protein alone provides protection from infection we conclude that both mucosal CTL and antibodies are required to protect against mucosal SIV challenge. In the upcoming years we will asses methods of improving the protective efficacy of gp96+ gp120 vaccination.',\n",
       " 'In April 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first two cases of human infection with a novel influenza A H1N1 virus in the United States and over the course of the next several weeks, the virus spread around the world prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global influenza pandemic on June 11, 2009. Antigenic and genetic characterization of the novel influenza A H1N1 virus indicated that the virus contained a unique combination of gene segments from North American and Eurasian lineages of swine influenza viruses. The viruses isolated from human cases of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection were antigenically homogeneous and antigenically similar to North American swine H1N1 viruses, but distinct from seasonal human influenza A H1N1 viruses.  Based on antigenic and genetic analysis and epidemiologic information, the WHO selected the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus as the reference virus for vaccine development; inactivated and live attenuated vaccines for pandemic H1N1 were licensed in 2009. We initiated clinical studies to evaluate the immunogenicity and infectivity of the licensed inactivated virus and live attenuated H1N1 vaccines in different age groups. Analysis of the data from these studies is in progress.',\n",
       " 'Wild mouse species and the various inbred laboratory mouse strains differ from one another in their susceptibility to the mouse gammaretroviruses and retrovirus-induced cancers. These differences are due to variations in specific host genes, and we have been engaged in an ongoing effort to identify and characterize several mouse genes involved in virus resistance.  Our major interest has been on factors that interfere directly with virus infection and replication, and we focus our efforts on those factors that inhibit virus entry and the early post-entry stages of the virus replicative cycle.  At the level of entry, there are two types of resistance genes that target the receptor-virus interaction.  Receptors can be blocked by virus envelope glycoprotein produced by endogenous retroviruses, or resistance can be caused by polymorphisms in the cell surface receptor.  After the gammaretrovirus enters the receptive cell, reverse transcription and translocation to the nucleus can be inhibited or altered by virus resistance factors Fv1, mApobec/Rfv3, and TRIM5alpha.Our current aim is to characterize these resistance factors and the viruses they target, define the origin and extent of antiviral activity in Mus evolution, and elucidate the responsible mechanisms.  This work relies heavily on wild mice because laboratory strains provide only a limited sampling of the genetic diversity in Mus.  Also, wild mouse species allow us to examine survival strategies in natural populations that harbor virus and to follow the evolution of the resistance genes.  These mice additionally provide a source of novel resistance genes and virus variants.  One set of projects aims to identify viral and cell receptor determinants responsible for virus binding and entry.  We are currently working on the XPR1 receptor for the xenotropic/polytropic mouse gammaretroviruses (XP-MLVs) and for XMRV, a xenotropic virus-like virus isolated from humans with prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome. We have determined that, in mouse populations exposed to infectious virus, virus resistance is mediated by polymorphisms of the cell surface receptor. We have now identified a total of four XPR1 susceptibility variants in wild mice and described the geographic and species distribution of the Mus Xpr1 variants. Three of the four receptors restrict entry by two or more of the virus host range variants that rely on XPR1, and all three of these receptors evolved in populations exposed to X-MLVs.  We used mutagenesis and phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the functional contributions made by conserved, variable and deleted residues in this receptor.  Rodent Xpr1 is under positive selection indicating a history of host-pathogen conflicts; several codons under selection have known roles in virus entry.  All non-Mus mammals are susceptible to mouse X-MLV, but some restrict other members of this family of viruses and the resistance of hamster and gerbil cells to the human-derived XMRV indicates that XMRV has unique receptor requirements.  We also showed that the hypervariable fourth extracellular XPR1 loop (ECL4) contains 3 evolutionarily constrained residues that do not contribute to receptor function.  We also identified two novel residues important for virus entry, and we described a unique pattern of variation in the 3 virus-restrictive Xpr1 variants found in MLV-infected house mice; these mice carry different deletions in the receptor determining region of XPR1 suggesting either that these sites or loop size affect receptor function.We also determined that the XPR1 receptor variant found in the laboratory mouse is not found in wild mouse populations. This laboratory mouse allele encodes a receptor that is uniquely resistant to xenotropic gammaretroviruses.  We screened laboratory mouse strains for sequence and functional variants of the XPR1 receptor, and identified the permissive wild mouse variant of this receptor in 7 laboratory strains.  We also typed these strains for Bxv1, an endogenous germline copy of the xenotropic virus that is capable of producing infectious virus.  We identified Bxv1 in many strains of mice, and traced its ancestry to the Japanese wild mouse, M. m. molossinus.  Bxv1 and the permissive allele were found together in one strain, F/St, which is characterized by lifelong viremia with xenotropic virus.    In another series of experiments, we have been using phylogenetic methods to identify and characterize host genes that have had an anti-viral role in the genus Mus. Among the mouse genes responsible for resistance to mouse leukemia viruses is Rfv3 (recovery from Friend virus).  This gene was recently shown to be encoded by the mouse APOBEC (mA3) gene, a cytidine deaminase gene known to restrict other retroviruses in mice and in humans.  We sequenced mA3 from multiple laboratory and wild mice to examine its evolution.  We discovered that the mA3 allele in virus resistant mice is disrupted by insertion of the regulatory signals of a mouse leukmia virus that correlated with enhanced mA3 expression in virus resistant mouse strains and species.  We also identified sites in mA3 under positive selection that specify residues in two loops along the groove that forms the mA3 active site.  We demonstrated by mutagenesis and functional assays that one of those two loops affects mA3 antiviral activity.  We thus showed that mA3 has had an antiviral role throughout mouse evolution, and we identified an inserted regulatory sequence and two clusters in the protein coding sequence that contribute to this antiviral function.More recently we focused on the fact that mA3 transcripts have different splicing patterns in virus-resistant mice like C57BL/6 compared with virus-sensitive strains like BALB/c.  C57BL/6 transcripts lack exon 5; this exon is spliced into mA3 of BALB/c and separates the two cytidine deaminase domains. We have now showed tht mA3 exon 5 is a functional element that influences protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level.  We also used in vitro splicing assays to identify two critical polymorphisms affecting the inclusion of exon 5 into mA3 transcripts: the number of TCCT repeats upstream of exon 5 and a single nucleotide substitition within exon 5.  We also found that distribution of exon 5 into mA3 mRNA is a relatively recent event in the evolution of mice.  The widespread geographic distribution of the exon 5-including genetic variant suggests that in some Mus populations the cost of maintaining an effective but mutagenic enzyme may outweigh its antiviral function.',\n",

       " '(I) Disease Models and Pathogenesis Goal: To develop disease/infection models for studying pathogenesis and research on vaccines/therapeutics.Rodents as disease models: The Syrian hamster has been broadly used in infectious disease research but research tools are limited. We have developed quantitative real time RT-PCR for monitoring hamster immune response genes (Zivcec 2011) and sequenced the transcriptome of the Syrian hamster. Annotation is still ongoing in collaboration with RTB (Dr. S. Porcella).The Andes virus hamster model is characterized by a strong suppression of innate immune responses during the early stage of infection and massive activation of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th2 responses during the symptomatic phase suggesting that infection-derived immune modulation is important to pathogenesis (Safronetz, in revision). The lethal Syrian hamster model for Nipah and Hendra virus infections is characterized by acute severe respiratory distress and severe neurological symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in animals challenged with a high dose, whereas animals challenged with a low dose mainly showed neurological signs of infection (Rockx 2011).We established an acute disease model for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) using mice lacking the type I interferon receptor. This model recapitulates most hallmarks of human CCHF disease including coagulation abnormalities (Zivcec, in preparation).  The emergence of Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) in domestic swine in the Philippines has caused a renewed interest in its pathogenicity. We have established a mouse disease models based on STAT1-/-mice, which may allow future pathogenesis studies (deWit 2011).Nonhuman primates as disease models: We have established lethal disease models in African green monkeys for Nipah and Hendra virus infection. Animals showed severe lesions in lungs and brains which are the main target organs of the infection.  The primary cause of death is severe respiratory distress (Rockx 2011). The virulence of a new Lassa strain from Mali was assessed in cynomolgus macaques in comparison with well studied isolates from Sierra Leona and Liberia. This virus (Soromba-R) was found to be less pathogenic which might be explained by a stronger early innate immune response (Safronetz, in preparation). (II) Vaccines and Therapeutics  Goal: To develop and characterize fast-acting vaccines and targets for therapeutic intervention for emerging/re-emerging viruses. Our main platform is based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine vectors. For post-exposure treatment of filovirus infections with rVSV vectors we could increase the treatment window to 24 and 48 hours post-infection with 80 and 30% success, respectively. This supports the use of the rVSV in cases of emergencies such as laboratory exposures (Geisbert 2010). Cross-protective vaccines would be very desirable for filoviruses in Central Africa due to overlapping endemicity zones. Recent studies in guinea pigs demonstrated that an rVSV vaccine expressing a single filovirus glycoprotein cannot achieve cross-protection, but the use of a bivalent vector expressing a second filovirus immunogen in a two-dose regime strongly increased cross-protective immunity (Marzi 2011). Multivalent vaccine vectors targeting different viruses with overlapping endemicity zones are of even greater public health interest. We performed a proof-of-concept study using a bivalent rVSV vector expressing glycoproteins of Ebola and Andes viruses. Complete protection was achieved against lethal challenge with both viruses in the common Syrian hamster model (Tsuda 2011). We have generated a new rVSV vector expressing Andes virus glycoproteins that provided complete protection in the Syrian hamster model. High titered neutralizing antibodies following a single vaccination seem to be important for protection in pre-exposure vaccination. The vaccine was protective when given three days prior to challenge and remained 90% effective even when administered 24 hours post-challenge. Here, a strong innate immune response seems to be the mechanism of protection (Brown 2011).  Ebola is a serious problem for the endangered great ape population in Central Africa. To address vaccine needs for remote wildlife populations we evaluated in a proof-of-concept study the use of a disseminating cytomegalovirus vaccine vector expressing a single Ebola nucleoprotein T cell epitope. The strategy provided complete protection against lethal challenge in the Ebola mouse model.  Future studies will focus on a disseminating vaccine vector for nonhuman primates (Tsuda 2011).The cellular cysteine proteases cathepsin B & L are proposed to play an important role in Ebola virus replication. We tested Ebola virus replication in cathepsin B & L knockout mice and could demonstrate that cathepsin cleavage is not necessary for Ebola virus replication. We conclude that other proteases can substitute for cathepsins making it difficult to use proteases as antiviral targets (Marzi, in preparation).We identified a new soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein (ssGP) generated through RNA editing of the glycoprotein gene. ssGP is a disulfide-linked dimer and exclusively N-glycosylated, but a function could not yet be assigned to this new protein (Mehedi 2011).  We are currently studying the mechanism of editing and its importance for pathogenesis. Preliminary studies have identified Ebola virus VP30 as a necessary factor for RNA editing.  We confirmed that the glycoproteins of pathogenic New World hantaviruses appear to be the primary antagonist of RIG-I directed IFN production.  In addition, we showed that the ANDV nucleocapsid protein (NP) serves as the primary antagonist in JAK-STAT signaling (Levine 2010). We tested the in vivo efficacy of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the G glycoprotein of henipaviruses. This mAb has potent in vitro neutralizing activity against Nipah and Hendra viruses. Intravenous application of the antibody as late as three days post infection completely protected African green monkeys against lethal Nipah or Hendra virus challenge (Bossart 2011). We tested the in vivo efficacy of ribavirin against Hendra virus infection in African green monkeys. Treatment did prolong and alter disease progression but was largely unsuccessful (Rockx 2011).  We also tested the effect of ribavirin on ANDV replication in the established lethal Syrian hamster model. We concluded that ribavirin treatment is beneficial for postexposure prophylaxis against HPS-causing hantaviruses (Safronetz 2011). (III) Ecology and TransmissionGoal: Understanding the interaction of virus and reservoir species to prevent transmission into end host. We collected Mastomys natalensis in southern Mali and isolated an arenavirus. Genetic analysis confirmed a unique Lassa virus, Soromba R, and demonstrated for the first time the presence of Lassa in southern Mali (Safronetz 2010). We have developed a framework for animal and human filovirus surveillance in the Republic of Congo. In addition, facilities for basic research will be created for holding, quarantine and breeding of indigenous fruit bat species. This will allow pathogenicity and transmission studies in the potential reservoir species of filoviruses. We have already identified long-term sampling sites (Munster, in preparation). We have established an infection model for Sin nombre virus (hantavirus) to study the immune response to infection in the natural reservoir species, the deer mouse. We have found that the deer mouse mounts a strong anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response to infection, thereby limiting pathology and allowing virus persistence (Prescott, in preparation)',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. The virus has spread efficiently to both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres and has been associated with over 16,000 deaths. Zoonotic infections with H1N1 influenza viruses that evolved initially from the 1918 virus and adapted to swine threatened a pandemic in 1976 (1976 swH1N1) and a novel reassortant H1N1 virus caused a pandemic in 2009-2010 (2009 pH1N1).  We previously showed that protection from severe 2009 pH1N1 infection is conferred by vaccination or prior infection with 1976 swH1N1 or 1918 in mice supporting available epidemiological data.  In a follow-up experiment, we sought to demonstrate cross-protection by immunization with 2009 pH1N1 or 1976 swH1N1 vaccines following a lethal challenge with the 1918 influenza virus.  Mice were immunized with 1976 swH1N1, 2009 pH1N1, 2009 seasonal trivalent, or 1918 virus vaccines and challenged with a lethal dose of the 1918 influenza virus. Cross-reactive antibody responses were assessed and protection monitored by survival, weight loss, and pathology.  Vaccination with the 1976 swH1N1 or 2009 pH1N1 vaccines protected mice from a lethal challenge with 1918, and these mice lost no weight and had significantly reduced viral load and pathology in the lungs.  Protection was likely due to cross-reactive antibodies detected by microneutralization assay.  Our data suggest that the general population may have some protection from a future 1918-like pandemic because of prior infection or immunization with 1976 swH1N1 or 2009 pH1N1.Obesity was identified as an independent risk factor for severe or fatal infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (2009 pH1N1), but was not previously recognized for previous pandemic or seasonal influenza infections.  A study was conducted to evaluate the role of obesity as an independent risk factor for severity of infection with 2009 pH1N1, seasonal H1N1, or a pathogenic H1N1 influenza virus in a mouse model.  Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and their non-obese, age-matched control counterparts were inoculated with a 2009 pH1N1, A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) virus, a current seasonal H1N1 virus, A/NY/312/2001 (NY312), or a pathogenic 1918-like H1N1 virus, A/Iowa/Swine/1931 (Sw31).  Following inoculation with CA/09, DIO mice had higher mortality (80%) than control mice (0%) and lost more weight during infection.  No effect of obesity on morbidity and mortality was observed during NY312 or Sw31 infection.  Influenza antigen distribution in the alveolar regions of the lungs was more pronounced in DIO than control mice during CA/09 infection at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), despite similar virus titers.  During CA/09 infection, localized interferon-&#946; and proinflammatory cytokine protein responses in the lungs were significantly lower in DIO than control mice.  Conversely, serum cytokine concentrations were elevated in DIO, but not control mice following infection with CA/09.  The effect of obesity on differential immune responses was abrogated during NY312 or Sw31 infection. Together, these data support epidemiological reports that obesity may be a risk factor for severe 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection, but the role of obesity in seasonal or highly virulent pandemic influenza infection remains unclear.In a collaboration with Heinz Feldmann, NIAID Laboratory of Virology, the pathogenicity of 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses was studied in a nonhuman primate model using cynomolgus macaques. In this experimental pathogenesis study, the parameters of clinical disease, virology, host immune response, and histopathology were compared among animals infected with different strains of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus along with a current seasonal H1N1 virus. Infections with the pandemic isolates resulted in more severe disease than infections with seasonal influenza, however heterogeneity in disease progression was noted between pandemic strains used.  The clinical course and disease progression in nonhuman primates mimicked influenza infection in humans, supporting the use of this experimental model for influenza.',\n",
       " 'Internal death programs play significant roles in many diseases.  Pathogenic effects can result from inefficient cell death or from inappropriate or excessive death such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during AIDS or the SAR-CoV virus during SARS. In this project, we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular mechanisms of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death programs in lymphocytes as well as other cell types. A major focus of our investigations are death-inducing cell surface receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as TNFR1 and CD95/Fas/APO-1.  Both receptors play an important role in stimulating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death of cells principally in immune processes. Little is known about how these alternative death pathways are entrained to receptor signaling.  Interestingly, both receptors can have effects beside death such as the induction of transcription factors. We are trying to understand how these receptors stimulate the intracellular machinery that causes cell death in preference to other cellular outcomes. We have devoted many of our efforts  to understanding the activation of a protease called caspase-8 which regulates the death program. We have characterized two death programs that emanate from TNFR1 and the Fas receptor, one which is caspase-8 dependent and has an apoptotic morphology and the other which is caspase-8 independent and involves necrosis. Interestingly, the latter death program is only observed when caspase-8 is inhibited. The regulation and molecular pathways of these two forms of lymphocyte death are distinct. In addition, we have discovered that inhibition of caspase-8 in non-lymphoid cells can lead to another form of cell death  exhibiting particular cytoplasmic double membrane structures called autophagy.  Although initially controversial, several labs have now shown that this form of death is particularly important for the demise of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. We have now shown that the mechanism of autophagic death program is selective degradation of catalase which leads to a marked overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage and death. Furthermore, we have focused on genes that play key roles in this process of death.  We have found that the human homologue of the Drosophila spinster protein, called hSpin, is essential for autophagic cell death.  We have studied the biochemical function of this protein and found that it is important for proper lysosome biogenesis and vesicle trafficking. In particular, it plays a vital role in lysosomal reformation at the end of  autophagy.      Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process from humans to yeast by which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are catabolized but very little was known about results at the end of autophagy when cells were selecting between autophagic cell death and survival. During starvation, the protein TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient-responsive kinase that controls cellular metabolism, is shut off, and autophagy is activated. Double-membrane autophagosomes sequester intracellular components and then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which to catabolize their contents to regenerate nutrients. Ourpresent understanding of autophagy is that it terminates with cargo degradation within autolysosomes, but how autophagy is controlled by nutrients and the subsequent fate of the autolysosome were unknown. We discovered that mTOR signalling in mammalian cells is inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated during extended starvation. Reactivation of mTOR depends on the degradation of autolysosomal products and release of nutrients. mTOR activity in turn terminates autophagy and stimulates impressive proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional lysosomes.  This process, that we term autophagic lysosome reforation (ALR), restores the full complement of lysosomes in the cell. This evolutionarily conserved cycle in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during starvation.     In parallel, we are exploring how the regulation of cellular death programs may play a role in cytopathicity associated with virus infections in AIDS and SARS.  In particular, a critical effect in the onset of AIDS following infection with HIV is the death of T lymphocytes caused by the virus. We have found that this death process is necrotic rather than apoptotic and have now identified two viral gene products, vif and vpr, that are involved in this process. We have found that vpr alters the cell cycle and promote death by binding to cellular proteins that have a role in cell cycle progression.  In order to study this process rigorously we have constructed a mathematical model to analyze cell death in tissue culture during HIV infection. Remarkably, both of these cytotoxic gene products cause says cycle arrest at the boundary of the G2 and M phases. The mathematical model reveals that the principal cause of cell loss is cell death rather than cell cycle arrest. We are using molecular genetic approaches to determine if cell cycle arrest actually causes cell death and how this might come about. The HIV vpr protein is a small protein (100 amino acids) with no obvious structural domains or enzymatic motifs other than three alpha helices.  We have determined that vpr promotes the formation of an apparently abortive complex between mitotic regulators such as CyclinB and Cdk1, and the theta isoform of the 14-3-3 protein which inhibits the cell cycle in the G2 phase.  The complex appears to be nucleated by a particular hydrophobic patch on the third helix of the vpr protein. We have also studied how vif causes cell cycle arrest and found that it is a distinctive mechanism from that induced by vpr.  We find that vif can alter the nucleocytoplasmic localization of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases which leads to disruption of normal cell cycle progression.  We continue to explore how HIV-1 alters to cellular  machinery to cause the demise of CD4 T cells.We investigated the functions of the largest of the accessory proteins, the ORF 3a protein, of SARS-CoV and found that ORF 3a accounted for cell death caused by this virus. In addition, ORF 3a causes SARS-CoV-induced Golgi fragmentation and that the 3a protein accumulates and localizes to vesicles containing markers for late endosomes. These results establish an important role for ORF 3a in SARS-CoV-induced cell death, Golgi fragmentation, and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles.  The overarching conclusion that we can draw from these studies is that cell death can be programmed in many different ways in the cell depending on the cell-type and conditions.  Various cell biological mechanisms can participate which means that the genetic control varies depending on the specific mechanism of death.  By understanding the molecular mechanisms of death, we hope to gain better insight into normal cellular homeostasis as well as degenerative disease processes.',\n",

The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S. and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza cases are also very significant resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths in the US annually.Given pre-existing cross-reactivity of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus with previously circulating H1N1 viruses, history suggests that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus may face extinction unless it mutates to escape the already high global population immunity. The immune escape mechanisms potentially at its disposal include antigenic drift, antigenic shift via genetic reassortment, and intra-subtypic reassortment. Going back to the late 19th century, the evolutionary histories of past pandemic viruses are examined in an effort to better understand the nature and extent of the immune pressures faced by the 2009 pandemic virus in the immediate future. While human influenza viruses have often surprised us, available evidence leads to the hope that the current pandemic virus will continue to cause low or moderate mortality rates if it does not become extinct.It is important to develop clinical natural history studies to compare natural infections with the new H1N1 pandemic virus with those from seasonal influenza viruses. The major goal of this project is to evaluate the natural history of pandemic influenza virus infection in comparison to infection with seasonal influenza viruses in both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients.  We plan to ultimately recruit up to 1000 patients with pandemic or seasonal influenza virus infection. Recruitment occurred in both inpatient and outpatient settings at multiple sites including the NIH Clinical Center, Suburban Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center. Careful clinical evaluation, analysis of viruses collected from patients, and studies of the immune response of the patients is being performed.  An ongoing effort is continuing to analyze the data collected over the past 3 years of this study and a report on these data is planned within the next 6 months.    The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic called attention to the limited influenza treatment options available, especially in individuals at high risk of severe disease. Neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant seasonal H1N1 viruses have demonstrated the ability to transmit well despite early data indicating that resistance reduces viral fitness. 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses have sporadically appeared containing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and the adamantanes, but the ability of these viruses to replicate, transmit, and cause disease in mammalian hosts has not been fully characterized. Two pre-treatment wild-type viruses and 2 post-treatment multi-drug-resistant viruses containing the neuraminidase H275Y mutation collected from immunocompromised patients infected with pandemic influenza H1N1 were tested for viral fitness, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in ferrets. The pretreatment wild-type viruses and post-treatment resistant viruses containing the H275Y mutation all demonstrated significant pathogenicity and equivalent viral fitness and transmissibility. The adamantane-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus can develop the H275Y change in the neuraminidase gene conferring resistance to both oseltamivir and peramivir without any loss in fitness, transmissibility, or pathogenicity. This suggests that the dissemination of widespread multi-drug resistance similar to neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in seasonal H1N1 is a significant threat.During the past year viral seed stocks have been produced and manufacturing has begun of influenza A challenge virus strains for the purpose of human influenza challenge studies.  A protocol has been developed, approvals sought, and resources put into place for such a study.  A healthy volunteer screening study has already begun at the Clinical Center to begin identifying patients who will qualify and be available for these challenge studies during the next year.',\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype, including H5N1 viruses that have caused human infections since 2003. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a disease of poultry that is caused by H5 or H7 avian influenza viruses and is associated with up to 100% mortality. H7 subtype viruses have significant pandemic potential. Influenza A H7 subtype viruses from both Eurasian and North American lineages have resulted in more than 100 cases of human infection since 2002 in the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A live attenuated H7N7 candidate vaccine virus was generated by reverse genetics using the modified hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of HP A/Netherlands/219/03 (NL/03) (H7N7) wild-type (wt) virus and the six internal protein genes of the cold-adapted (ca) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (AA ca) (H2N2) virus. The reassortant H7N7 NL/03 ca vaccine virus was temperature sensitive and attenuated in mice, ferrets, and African green monkeys (AGMs). Intranasal administration of a single dose of the H7N7 NL/03 ca vaccine virus fully protected mice from lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous H7 viruses from Eurasian and North American lineages. Two doses of the H7N7 NL/03 ca vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies in the serum and provided complete protection from pulmonary replication of homologous and heterologous wild-type H7 challenge viruses in mice and ferrets. One dose of the H7N7 NL/03 ca vaccine elicited an antibody response in one of three AGMs that was completely protected from pulmonary replication of the homologous wild-type H7 challenge virus. The contribution of CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells to the vaccine-induced protection in mice was evaluated by T cell depletion; T lymphocytes were not essential for the vaccine-induced protection from lethal challenge with H7 wt viruses. Additionally, passively transferred neutralizing antibody induced by H7N7 NL/03 ca virus protected mice from lethality following challenge with H7 wt viruses. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of H7N7 NL/03 ca vaccine virus in mice, ferrets and AGMs support the evaluation of this vaccine virus in Phase 1 clinical trials. While LAIVs have been shown to be efficacious and have been licensed for human use, the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) have to be updated for optimal protective efficacy.  Little is known about the effect of different HA and NA proteins on the immunogenicity of LAIVs developed using the same backbone.  A panel of LAIVs that share the internal protein genes, with unique HA and NA gene segments from different influenza subtypes were rescued by reverse genetics and a comparative study of immune responses induced by these vaccines were conducted in mice.  The results suggest that the magnitude of lung immunity, including pulmonary IgA antibody and memory CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by the vaccines depends on the replication efficiency of the LAIVs, as well as the induction of cytokines/chemokines in the lungs.  However, these factors are not important in determining systemic immunity such as serum antibody titers and memory CD8+ T cells in the spleen.  A qualitative analysis of immune responses induced by a single dose of an H5N1 LAIV revealed that the vaccine induced robust systemic and mucosal immunity in mice.  In addition, antibodies and memory lymphocytes established in the lungs following vaccination were required for protection against lethal challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses. Our results highlight the different requirements for inducing systemic and lung immunity that can be explored for the development of pulmonary immunity for protection against respiratory pathogens.Several H5N1 LAIV vaccines possessing a modified HA and neuraminidase (NA) of an H5N1 virus and the six internal protein gene segments of the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) cold-adapted (AA ca) master donor virus were previously generated and evaluated for their immunogenicity and efficacy in mice and ferrets.  A single dose of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN04 ca) LAIV elicited very low levels of serum neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous wild-type (wt) H5N1 viruses four weeks after administration to mice and ferrets.  In contrast, a single dose of A/Hong Kong/213/2003 (H5N1) (HK03 ca) LAIV was more immunogenic. A specific amino acid residue at position 227 in the HK03 HA has been reported to be responsible for the greater immunogenicity of HK03.  VN04 and HK03 also differ in their receptor binding specificity. The VN04 HA mainly recognizes &#945;2,3SAL while the HK03 HA recognizes both &#945;2,3SAL and &#945;2,6SAL.  Sequence alignment of the two H5 HA proteins revealed nine amino acid (aa) differences in their HA1 region.  We evaluated the impact of these amino acid differences on H5N1 VN ca vaccine strain replication and immunogenicity. Among the 9 amino acids that differed between the two H5 HA1 proteins, several HK03-specific residues enabled the VN04 ca virus to bind to both &#945;2,3SAL and &#945;2,6SAL receptors, but only the removal of the 158N glycosylation site together with an S227N change resulted in more efficient viral replication in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and increased serum antibody response.  However, the antibody response was HK03 strain-specific and did not significantly cross-neutralize VN04 virus.  A second approach was taken to adapt the H5N1 VN04 ca virus in MDCK cells to select HA variants with larger plaque morphology. Although a number of large-plaque HA variants with amino acid changes in the HA receptor binding region were identified, none of these mutations affected virus receptor binding preference and immunogenicity. In addition, the known receptor binding site changes, Q226L and G228S, were introduced into the HA protein of the VN04 ca virus.  Only in conjunction with the removal of the 158N glycosylation site did the virus replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and became more immunogenic, yet the response was also HK03-specific. Our studies indicate that the 158N glycosylation site and the receptor binding preference of the VN04 ca vaccine virus affect virus antigenicity and cause poor replication in the host resulting in a lower antibody response.  In collaboration with scientists at Yale University, we analyzed the ability of a vaccine vector based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to induce a neutralizing antibody (nAb) response to avian influenza viruses in rhesus macaques. Animals vaccinated with vectors expressing either the A/Hong Kong/156/1997 or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5 hemagglutinin (HA) were able to generate robust nAb responses. The ability of the vectors to induce nAbs against homologous and heterologous avian influenza viruses after a single dose was dependent upon the HA antigen incorporated into the VSV vaccine.  The vectors expressing the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5 hemagglutinin were superior to those expressing the A/Hong Kong/156/1997 HA at inducing cross-clade nAbs.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and its impact is not yet fully understood. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Re-evaluation of the histopathology in 1918 influenza cases: We performed a detailed histopathologic review of 1918 pandemic influenza autopsy cases from 68 influenza and pneumonia cases of patients dying between May and October 1918, a period which includes approximately 4 months before the 1918 pandemic was recognized, and two months (September-October, 1918) during which it appeared and peaked.  The cases were from the archives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  The lung tissues of 37 of these cases were positive for influenza viral antigens or viral RNA, including 4 from the pre-pandemic period (May-August).  The pre-pandemic and pandemic peak cases were indistinguishable clinically and pathologically.  All 68 cases had histological evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and 94% showed abundant bacteria on Gram stain.  Sequence analysis of the viral hemagglutinin receptor-binding domain performed on RNA from 13 cases suggested a trend from a more avian-like viral receptor specificity with G222 in pre-pandemic cases to a more human-like specificity associated with D222 in pandemic peak cases.  Viral antigen distribution in the respiratory tree, however, was not apparently different between pre-pandemic and pandemic peak cases, or between infections with viruses bearing different receptor binding polymorphisms.  The 1918 pandemic virus was circulating for at least 4 months in the U.S. before it was recognized epidemiologically in September 1918.  The causes of the unusually high mortality in the 1918 pandemic were not explained by the pathological and virological parameters examined.  These findings have important implications for understanding the origins and evolution of pandemic influenza viruses.  The distribution of viral antigen was similar to that observed from autopsy studies previously performed on fatal 2009 pandemic influenza autopsy cases. Prominent staining was observed in the respiratory epithelium of the tracheobronchial tree, but with clear evidence of viral antigen in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. One 1918 pneumonia case also showed abundant erythrocyte sickling. DNA sequence analysis of the hemoglobin beta gene identified the mutation associated with sickle cell anemia.Influenza infections, as seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza, and animal epizootics of influenza have been reported in the medical literature for hundreds of years.  In a series of analyses of historical data, information on past pandemics as early as 1510 were reviewed.  Despite the current notion that pandemic influenza is a distinct phenomenon obeying such constant (if incompletely understood) rules such as dramatic genetic change, cyclicity,  wave  patterning, virus replacement, and predictable epidemic behavior, much evidence suggests the opposite. Pandemics arise as a result of various genetic mechanisms, have no apparent predictable patterns of mortality among different age groups, and vary greatly in how and when they arise and recur. Some are followed by new pandemics, whereas others fade gradually or abruptly into long-term endemicity. Human influenza pandemics have been caused by viruses that evolved singly or in co-circulation with other pandemic virus descendants and often have involved significant transmission between, or establishment of, viral reservoirs within other animal hosts. In recent decades, pandemic influenza has continued to produce numerous unanticipated events that expose fundamental gaps in scientific knowledge. Influenza pandemics appear to be not a single phenomenon but a heterogeneous collection of viral evolutionary events whose similarities are overshadowed by important differences, the determinants of which remain poorly understood. These uncertainties make it difficult to predict influenza pandemics and, therefore, to adequately plan to prevent them.',\n",
       " 'An experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease is critical for the study of human AIDS. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. The purpose of this project is to investigate host and viral factors involved in variable disease progression in SIV-infected macaques and the lack of disease in African primates infected with their own strains of SIVPATHOGENESIS OF SIVsm-INFECTION OF MACAQUESTo investigate the role of host factors in SIV-infection of macaques, we used a well-defined molecularly cloned virus (SIVsmE543-3). Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that PBMC of individual macaques show vastly different susceptibility to SIVsmE543-3 infection in vitro and susceptibility is predictive of subsequent plasma viremia following inoculation. Recent studies have now identified that this difference is attributable to allelic polymorphisms in the SPRY domain of TRIM5 alpha gene. In contrast, SIVmac appears to be uniquely adapted for resistance to multiple alleles of rhesus macaque TRIM5.  We evaluated the effect of expression of the restrictive alleles on subsequent viremia in a cohort of 43 rhesus SIVsmE543-3-infected rhesus macaques.   The restrictive genotypes were associated with significantly lower viremia than observed in macaques with the permissive genotype, as well as emergence of escape mutations in the SIV capsid protein.  The specific amino acid substitutions found in viruses that escaped from TRIM5 restriction have been introduced into an E543-3 background in an effort to generate more reproducible viremia.  These substitutions confer resistance to TRIM5 restriction by previously resistant alleles in a single cycle assay and greater replication ability in primary PBMC of macaques homozygous for the resistant allele. This difference in susceptibility to TRIM5 polymorphism between SIVsm and SIVmac may explain the greater degree of protection achieved in immunized macaques challenged with repeated low dose intrarectal challenges with SIVsmE660 versus SIVmac251.Full length infectious clones of the related challenge stock, SIVsmE660 have also been generated by close to full length RT-PCR from the virus stock.  Three of these viruses replicate efficiently in rhesus PBMC in vitro and both have Tier 1 neutralizing antibody sensitivity.   It terms of TRIM5 restriction, all three are sensitive to the TRIM-TFP allele but two have mutations in the cyclophylin A binding loop that confer resistance to TRIM-CypA restriction.  Two clones are presently being evaluated for in vivo viral replication and pathogenesis in TRIM-TFP/Q expressing rhesus macaques following both intravenous and intrarectal inoculation.  Both clones resulted in robust and persistent viremia that was associated with significant loss of CD4+ memory T cells. The molecular and biologic evolution of neutralization resistance is currently being evaluated in these animals.SIV NEUROPATHOGENESIS.  SIV and HIV are both associated with the development of encephalitis. For HIV, the onset of AIDS dementia is generally a late stage finding. In contrast, most models of SIV encephalitis (SIVE) use animals that progress rapidly to disease and for that reason use pigtail macaques. We observed a small number of rhesus that developed SIVE over a more protacted course. The evolution of SIV in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was compared with the virus that evolved in the plasma of two rhesus macaques that developed SIVE. While the virus in the CSF and plasma were similar during primary infection, distinct substitutions were observed sequentially in the two compartments. These findings are consistent with compartmentalization between the brain and blood during development of neuro-AIDS and the evolution of viruses with distinct genotypes and potentially distinct biological phenotypes in the brain. One of these isolates, SIVsmH631Br induced SIVE in one of four macaques; virus isolated from the brain off this animal (SIVsmH783Br) induced SIVE or meningitis in 4 of the 6 animals. Evolution of virus in the brain, CSF, blood and lymphoid tissues was evaluated using single genome amplification of selected samples and demonstrated compartmentalization of virus in the brain and CSF as compared to blood and plasma.   An additional passage of virus (SIVsmH804E) has been inoculated into four rhesus and preliminary results show high plasma viremia and moderate CSF viremia.  Studies are also underway to study the molecular features of virus in the parenchyma and meninges using laser capture microdissection (LCM).  Full-length infectious clones representative of this virus will be generated. ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION OF NATURAL HOST SPECIES.  A second goal of this project is to study the mechanisms underlying the lack of pathogenicity of SIV for their natural host species, with emphasis on SIVagm from vervet monkeys. SIVagm is capable of inducing AIDS in PT macaques but African green monkeys (AGM) do not develop overt signs of disease following infection. We previously perturbed the development of adaptive immune responses by combined administration of anti-CD8 and CD20 antibodies during primary infection of PTM, and AGM and compared these animals to historical controls infected with the same virus. Depletion resulted in a 1-log increase in primary viremia and a 4-log increase in post-acute viremia in PTM and three of the four PTM were euthanized within 6 weeks of inoculation due to massive CMV reactivation and disease. In contrast, all four lymphocyte-depleted AGM remained healthy. Plasma viremia showed only a brief trend to a higher level viremia during primary infection but the groups were indistinguishable during chronic infection. These data suggest that adaptive immune responses are critical in pathogenic SIV infection in PTM. However, the maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms including non-adaptive immune mechanisms. In a study of a cohort of SIV-infected and naive vervet AGM, we found that many of the CD4+ T cells from African green monkeys down-regulate CD4 in vivo as they enter the memory pool and that this occurs independent of SIV infection. These CD4-negative memory T cells maintain functions that are normally attributed to CD4 T cells including production of IL-2, production of IL-17, expression of FoxP3 and expression of CD40L; however lack of CD4 expression apparently protects these activated cells from infection by SIVagm in vivo. Thus the absence of SIV-induced disease progression in natural hosts species may be partially explained by preservation of a subset of T cells that maintain CD4 T cell function while being resistant to SIV-infection in vivo.   We also observed that infant AGM have very few memory CD4+ T cells which might make them more resistant to SIV infection.   Therefore we have been conducting small scale breeding of SIVagm-infected AGM using pair housing; this has been successful with the production of 14 infants over a five year period.   None of these infants became infected despite being nursed by their infected mothers for a year  following birth.   We have therefore initiated studies of SIVagm infection in three infant AGM (1 year of age).   There was no adverse clinical consequence of infection in all three infants with normal kinetics of viremia observed in two of the 3 animals. These animals will be monitored longterm for clinical progression and future studies will focus on infants closer to the neonatal period.',\n",
       " \"Diarrheal diseases are the second leading single cause of death (behind pneumonia) in children under 5 years of age, accounting for approximately 15% (1.336 million) of the estimated 8.795 million deaths in this age group annually, with the greatest toll in the developing countries. Rotaviruses (RVs) have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries accounting for approximately 500,000 deaths in the under 5 year age group, mostly in developing countries. RVs are uniquely egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions. We developed an oral, live, attenuated RV vaccine in a quadrivalent formulation to protect against the four epidemiologically important serotypes (G1-4).The vaccine was comprised of representatives of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus rotavirus (RRV), a G3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and three human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing ten RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype G1, G2, or G4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the candidate vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease, the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Subsequently, in August 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV) to Wyeth Laboratories. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception. Following additional CDC investigations, in October 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported the vaccine's link with intussusception. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Laboratories withdrew the vaccine from the market. Later data demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor in the link with intussusception. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to intussusception (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately. In addition, there are questions regarding the vaccine's actual attributable risk of intussusception, a risk estimate that has ranged widely. Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 epidemiologically-important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-Univ.of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study in Finland, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule, the BRV-TV and RRV-TV induced a high level of protection against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH collaborative study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in three different schedules, showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition, the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at two months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company (which was later transferred to the non-profit International Medica Foundation (IMF). This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially but was revived when funding became available from the IMF. Thus, a quadrivalent RRV-TV vaccine (RotaShield) was produced by The IDT Biologika GmbH in Germany, and became available in 2009 for clinical trial. A placebo-controlled phase II safety and efficacy trial began with RotaShield in Ghana on August 28, 2009 when 9 neonates were given orally the vaccine or placebo. By the end of Nov 2009 almost 1000 infants were given the 2nd dose of RotaShield or placebo: the 1st dose within the first 29 days of life and the 2nd dose before 60 days of age with a minimum interval of 3 weeks . The study period  ended at the end of November, 2010 when the final participant  reached an age within two weeks of the first birthday. The vaccine demonstrated 67% efficacy against  pooled G1-G4 diarrhea in almost 900 study individuals  and induced a 4-fold or greater IgA ELISA antibody response in over 50% of vaccinees.  In addition, efforts to implement our second generation vaccine, the human RV-bovine RV reassortant vaccine (BRV) for the developing countries have advanced. The NIH OTT initially granted licenses to develop the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions, one in the U.S. and seven in developing countries (Brazil, China and India).Three of the 8 have engaged in vaccine production and in various stages of early clinical trials (one of these was suspended- contamination) and a fourth licensee is producing pre-vaccine materials. Requests for licenses have continued with the OTT granting licenses for BRV vaccine to an additional 2 laboratories in 2009 and 2 in 2010 in China with pending requests for licenses by 5 additional labs in China and one in India. Also, one laboratory in China was granted a license to manufacture a human-porcine (Gottfried) reassortant vaccine in 2008 and additionally is seeking a license for the BRV vaccine. LID serves as the unofficial reference laboratory for this program performing various functions (e.g. ranging from temperature stability, to sequence analysis, etc). We are proposing that  the second generation RV vaccine be comprised of 6 serotypes (G1-4, 8 and 9) as a universal vaccine or as a specifically designed vaccine for different areas of the world.  The proposed manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its availability at low cost, which would facilitate its implementation in the developing areas of the world. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world was given an unsolicited boost, when we were notified in Oct 2006 by PATH that the Gates Foundation had approved their application with funding  ... to support the process and clinical development of the NIH bovine rotavirus vaccine through Phase 2 at two selected manufacturers; and address product development challenges relevant to all emerging manufacturers of this vaccine.  This grant has been extended through  2012. In addition, in Nov 2010 PATH received a new grant from the Gates Foundation which will support a large phase 3 trial of one our licensees in India of a pentavalent BRV vaccine. In 2010, PATH also received a grant from the Dep't for Int'l Dev (DFID), which in part is for the support of a reference lab in Vellore, India for BRV vaccine candidates which will   ... provide  technical support and training on immunological assays to four BRV producers.\",\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. A single polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and at least seven non-structural proteins. The genome organization of the DEN viruses is 5-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3 (UTR  untranslated region, C  capsid, prM  membrane precursor, E  envelope, NS  nonstructural). There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) that circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million dengue infections and hundreds of thousands of cases of the more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) with children bearing much of the disease burden. DEN viruses are endemic in at least 100 countries and cause more human disease than any other mosquito-borne virus. In at least eight Asian countries, the DEN viruses are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Unfortunately, many countries affected by DEN viruses have very limited financial resources for healthcare, and the economic burden of DEN disease is considerable. As such, an economical vaccine that prevents disease caused by the DEN viruses is a global public health priority.The cost-effectiveness, safety, long-term immunity, and efficacy associated with the live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus, serves as a model for the feasibility of a live attenuated DEN virus vaccine. However, the development of a live attenuated dengue vaccine has been complicated by several factors. First, it has been difficult to develop monovalent vaccines against each of the four serotypes that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Second, an effective live attenuated dengue virus vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation of components representing each serotype because multiple serotypes typically co-circulate in a region, each DEN serotype is capable of causing disease, and the introduction of additional serotypes is common. In addition, the association of increased disease severity (DHF/DSS) in previously infected persons undergoing an infection by a different dengue serotype necessitates a vaccine that will confer long-term protection against all four serotypes. Third, it has been difficult for developers to formulate a tetravalent vaccine with low reactogenicity that induces a broad neutralizing antibody response against each DEN serotype. Fourth, a dengue vaccine must confer protection against a wide range of genetically diverse subtypes that are dispersed around the world and can be readily introduced into a new region by international travel.  Fifth, a dengue vaccine must be produced economically so that it can be made available to populations that need it most. We have tried to address these issues as part of a program to generate a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. To maximize the likelihood that suitable vaccine candidates would be identified, monovalent vaccine candidates for DEN1-4 were generated by several distinct recombinant methods and found to be attenuated and immunogenic in mouse and rhesus monkey models. In one method, deletion of 30 contiguous nucleotides (del30) from the 3 UTR of wild type cDNA clones of DEN1-4 was used to generate vaccine candidates such as rDEN1del30 and rDEN4del30.   Point mutations previously selected for their attenuation phenotype were also introduced into rDEN4del30 to yield vaccine candidates rDEN4del30-200,201 and rDEN4del30-4995.  Because the del30 mutation failed to properly attenuate DEN2 and DEN3, alternative strategies were employed to create vaccine candidates for these serotypes. Antigenic chimeric viruses were generated by replacing wild type M and E structural genes of rDEN4del30 with those from DEN1, DEN2 or DEN3, and the resulting chimeric viruses, rDEN1/4del30, rDEN2/4del30, and rDEN3/4del30 were attenuated and immunogenic in rhesus monkeys.  Two additional vaccine candidates for DEN3 were generated by 1) exchanging the 3 UTR of rDEN3 with that derived from attenuated rDEN4del30 to generate rDEN3-3D4del30, and 2) introducing a pair of 3 UTR deletions into DEN3 to create vaccine candidate rDEN3del30/31.  Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials.  During the past year, tetravalent mixtures have been successfully tested in over 80 subjects.Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of vital functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits, preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data.Efforts to develop a live attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine are ongoing.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with the live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory has successfully recovered these engineered viruses and evaluated their pathogenicity in mice.  The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and thus provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations.  A number of the rJEV/DEN4 chimeric viruses are highly attenuated in mice and will be further studied as vaccine candidates.',\n",
       " 'Findings from FY11 are summarized below.1.  Orthopoxvirus pathogenesisThe threat of intentional release of variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, continues to be a chief biodefense concern.  Zoonotic orthopoxviruses including cowpox (CPXV) and particularly monkeypox virus (MPXV) currently cause sporadic disease in humans, with case-fatality rates from MPXV infections reaching as high as 10%.  Based on the above considerations, investigations into orthopoxviral pathogenesis and the identification of countermeasures have recently accelerated. The development of animal models that accurately reflect human disease is critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis of VARV infection and evaluation of countermeasures against the orthopoxviruses.  Because of the successful eradication of smallpox and the sporadic and geographically isolated nature of MPXV outbreaks, the only option for licensing new drugs and vaccines for smallpox and other orthopoxvirus diseases is extrapolation of data derived from accurate, validated animal models.  Furthermore, the underlying viral and host mechanisms that control disease outcome in orthopoxvirus infection are poorly understood and in need of continued study.  While VARV and MPXV nonhuman primate (NHP) models in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques have been used for evaluation of vaccines and antiviral therapies, biosafety and security restrictions on the use of both viruses limit their widespread use by the research community.  A NHP model that mimics VARV induced disease and is readily available to the broader research community (a BSL-2 agent) would serve as a distinct advantage to accelerate research and, if necessary, potentially replace the VARV NHP model.  Therefore we have investigated whether cowpox, a BSL-2 agent which causes occasional NHP infections in European zoos, might be a useful model of orthopoxvirus infection.  Unexpectedly, we found that intravenous inoculation of cynomolgus macaques  with cowpox Brighton resulted in a lethal disease across all doses tested (5x10e5 to 5x10e7 PFU) within 12 days post-inoculation in two independent experiments.  Clinical observations and hematological and histopathological findings supported hemorrhagic disease that resembled human hemorrhagic smallpox.  Specifically, petechial rash, hemorrhagic lesions in skin and gut, hematuria, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated prothrombin times (PT), and increased concentrations of fibrin degradation products and D-dimers were consistently observed.  Cowpox virus replicated to high levels in blood (8.0-9.0 log10 gene copies/mL) and tissues including lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, bone marrow, and lungs.  While hemorrhagic smallpox was a rare manifestation of disease (<3% of cases), it was rapid, severe, and nearly uniformly fatal.  The mechanisms that resulted in this form of disease are unknown. The characterization of this model and the hemorrhagic manifestations serves as an additional model to test countermeasures as well as a model to determine the pathogenesis of this most severe form of poxviral disease.  Such studies will serve to complement the existing nonhuman primate models of more classical poxviral disease.We have also continued our studies of monkeypox pathogenesis.  Specific highlights of FY2011 include expanded monitoring of disease progression in macaques by FDG-PET/CT by monitoring of bone marrow and lymph node immune activation in untreated or Cidofovir-treated macaques.  In addition, we have identified cytokines that are associated with disease outcome after intravenous monkeypox infection. Finally, we have investigated the host kinome response to monkeypox virus infection with strains of differing virulence.2.  Pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic feversViral hemorrhagic fevers are amongst the most deadly viral infections, but our understanding of viral pathogenesis, the host response to infection, and factors affecting disease outcome is limited.  Simian Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (SHFV) has caused outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in Asian origin macaques that have occurred sporadically at primate research facilities after first being identified in 1964.  SHFV is a BSL-2 pathogen that has not been linked to human disease; as such, investigation of SHFV pathogenesis in non-human primates (NHPs) could serve as a model resulting in a better understanding of human hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses.  We described the pathogenesis of SHFV in rhesus macaques inoculated with doses ranging from 50 PFU to 500,000 PFU.  Disease severity was independent of dose with an overall mortality rate of 64%.  Infected NHPs developed disease suggestive of multi-organ system involvement including the mononuclear phagocyte, circulatory, lymphoid, renal, and hepatic systems.  Analyses comparing survivors and non-survivors were performed to identify factors associated with survival revealing differences in the kinetics of viremia, immunosuppression, and regulation of hemostasis.  Statistical analyses showed an association between lethal disease and increases in aPTT, AST, ALP, ALT, MCP-1, and IL-6 concentrations and a decrease in ALB. These results are important for several reasons. First they have demonstrated notable similarities between the pathogenesis of SHFV in NHPs and hemorrhagic fever viruses in humans suggesting that SHFV is an appropriate model of BSL-4 pathogens at the BSL-2 level. Second, the identification of biomarkers associated with disease outcome and severity points to factors that can be targeted for treatment or disease monitoring. Finally, examination of cytokine levels has implicated MCP-1 levels as predictive of severe disease in an additional viral infection suggesting further study and therapeutic potential.3.  Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and Ebola virusThe search for a safe and efficacious vaccine for Ebola virus continues as no current vaccine candidate is nearing licensure.  Ebola virus is a concern for humans and nonhuman primate populations living in Africa and a chief biodefense concern of the United States.  We have developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University.  ZEBOV GP is efficiently expressed by these vaccine candidates and is incorporated into virions.  The vaccine candidates were avirulent after inoculation of adult mice, and viruses with a deletion in the RABV glycoprotein have greatly reduced neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation in suckling mice.  Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice.  Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the bivalent vaccines are able to induce anti-EBOV immunity in the presence of pre-existing RABV antibodies, and that the RABV/EBOV vaccines can be added to multivalent formulations.  The bivalent RABV/ZEBOV vaccines described here have several distinct advantages that may speed the development of inactivated vaccines for use in humans and potentially live or inactivated vaccines for endemic nonhuman primates at risk of EBOV infection.  Problems with pre-existing vector immunity, safety, dosing schedule, and manufacturing obstacles that are associated with current competing Ebola vaccine candidates are largely absent from the RABV/EBOV approach.  Rabies virus is still a severe and common disease in Africa, so vaccination of individuals with this bivalent vaccine would serve as a public health success',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in approximately 36,000 deaths in the US annually.The influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for binding sialic acid containing glycoproteins on cells to initiate infection.  The specificity of HA binding to terminal sialic acid (SA) residues is dependent on the conformation of the bond to the penultimate carbohydrate.  In general, avian-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,3 Gal and human-adapted IAVs have a binding preference for SA alpha2,6 Gal.  To understand how changing HA binding specificity affects IAV virulence in a mouse model, we studied the growth, virulence and pathogenicity of a number of recombinant influenza viruses expressing wild-type and mutant avian and human HA genes created using reverse genetics on the backbone of a contemporary low passage human H1N1 virus.  Chimeric influenza viruses with the hemagglutinin segment of the 1918, 1957, 1968, or 2009 pandemic influenza viruses in the context of a seasonal H1N1 influenza genome were constructed to analyze the role of hemagglutinin (HA) in pathogenesis and cell tropism in a mouse model. We also explored whether there was an association between the ability of lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) to bind to the HA and the ability of the corresponding chimeric virus to infect bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract. Viruses expressing the hemagglutinin of pandemic viruses were associated with significant pathology in the lower respiratory tract, including acute inflammation, and showed low binding activity for SP-D. In contrast, the virus expressing the HA of a seasonal influenza strain induced only mild disease with little lung pathology in infected mice and exhibited strong in vitro binding to SP-D.In collaboration with Paul Digard, Cambridge University, the regulation of expression of different viral proteins encoded by the influenza A virus segment 2 (PB1) was examined.  The PB1 mRNA expresses three polypeptides: PB1, PB1-F2 and PB1-N40, from AUGs 1, 4 and 5 respectively. Two short open reading frames (sORFs) initiated by AUGs 2 and 3 are also present. To understand translational regulation in this system, AUGs 1-4 were systematically mutated and polypeptide synthesis was monitored from plasmids and recombinant viruses. This identified sORF2 as a key regulatory element with opposing effects on PB1-F2 and PB1-N40 expression. Overall, it was concluded that segment 2 mRNA translation is regulated by a combination of leaky ribosomal scanning and reinitiation, and that the sequences surrounding the PB1 AUG codon are multifunctional, containing overlapping signals for translation initiation and for segment-specific packaging.Secondary bacterial infections increase disease severity of influenza infections and contribute greatly to increased morbidity and mortality during pandemics, including the 1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics. To study secondary bacterial infection following primary influenza virus infection, BALB/c mice were inoculated with sub-lethal doses of 2009 seasonal H1N1 virus (NIH50) or 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus (Mex09) followed by inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) 48h later.  Disease course was characterized by weight loss, survival, titration of virus and bacteria by qRT-PCR and histopathology.  Host responses were studied by expression microarray and immunohistochemistry.  Mice inoculated with virus alone showed 100% survival for all groups.  Mice inoculated with Mex09+SP showed severe weight loss and 100% mortality with severe alveolitis, denuded bronchiolar epithelium and widespread expression of apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3.  In contrast, mice inoculated with NIH50+SP showed increased weight loss, 100% survival and slightly enhanced lung pathology.  Mex09+SP co-infection resulted in increased SP replication in lung, and bacteremia that occurred late in infection.  Global gene expression profiling revealed that Mex09+SP co-infection did not induce significantly more severe inflammatory responses, but featured significant loss of epithelial cell reproliferation and repair responses.  Histopathological examination for cell proliferation marker MCM7 showed significant staining of airway epithelial cells in all groups except Mex09+SP.  This study demonstrated that secondary bacterial infection during 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus infection resulted in increased bacterial replication, more severe disease and loss of lung repair responses compared to 2009 seasonal influenza viral and bacterial infection. Moreover, this study provides novel insights into influenza and bacterial co-infection by showing a correlation of lethal outcome with loss of airway basal epithelial cells and associated lung repair responses.',\n",
       " \"The HVS in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium,  developed several candidate live attenuated HAV vaccines. One such candidate was modified to become the currently licensed GSK inactivated HAV vaccine. In addition, the HVS developed a candidate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine that was highly promising and that completed phase II clinical trials. In studies to characterize this candidate hepatitis E vaccine, we performed extensive pre-clinical trials to determine the potency of the vaccine, the duration of protection, the optimum regimen for administration, its protective efficacy against homologous versus heterologous virus strains, its ability to prevent infection as well as hepatitis and the minimum antibody titer that was effective in preventing infection and hepatitis, respectively. In the clinical trial, the vaccine was 96% efficacious in preventing hepatitis E following three doses of vaccine and 87% efficacious following two doses.  The vaccine had no detectable side effects.  These results are outstanding for a vaccine.  However, GSK elected not to pursue the manufacture of this vaccine and the NIAID is exploring other options for licensing the intellectual property for a hepatitis E vaccine.  Several Asian pharmaceutical companies have expressed an interest in making a hepatitis E vaccine, perhaps in conjunction with a hepatitis A vaccine.The study of HCV, including vaccine development, is complicated by the genetic heterogeneity of the virus, which has resulted in the recognition of at least six major genotypes and many subtypes.  Detecting and quantifying the virus requires different sets of primers for PCR amplification.  We  developed real-time PCR assays for the six major genotypes and have compared their specificity and sensitivity with other published assays.  In addition, in FY 2009 and FY 2010, we further characterized the six major genotypes of HCV by preparing chimpanzee-derived plasma pools for each and determining the infectivity titer of them by reverse titration in additional chimpanzees.  We are distributing these pools to the scientific community for vaccine studies and anticipate that they will be useful in furthering hepatitis C vaccine development.  As an extension of these studies and as an aid to furthering basic research on HCV, we are preparing infectious cDNA clones of those HCV genotypes for which such clones are not available (genotypes 3, 4, 5 and 6).  These studies are being performed in collaboration with Dr. Jens Bukh and Dr. William Satterfield.  Considerable progress was made in 2010: infectious clones of genotypes 3 and 4 were completed and their infectivity confirmed by percutaneous intrahepatic transfection of chimpanzees.  Less progress has been made with HCV genotypes 5 and 6.  Despite repeated transfection attempts, neither of these full-length clones was infectious in chimpanzees.  We are currently re-examining sequence data and attempting to replace parts of the clones that are suspected of being defective.  Attempts to demonstrate infectivity of modified clones is being carried out at Bioqual Inc.Immunity  to HCV is poorly understood and there is controversy over how complete and how long-lasting immunity to prior exposure of the virus is.  This has implications for preventing chronic infections and their sequelae, cirrhosis and liver cancer.  We have demonstrated that immunity to repeated exposure to HCV is genotype-specific, incomplete and relatively short-lived: even reexposure to the homologous virus can result in persistent infection.In other studies, GB virus-B (GBV-B) immunity was further studied. GBV-B is the closest relative to hepatitis C virus, which is very difficult to study because it is  transmissible only to chimpanzees. In contrast, GBV-B is transmissible to tamarins, a species of New World monkey not considered to be endangered. Tamarins that had previously been infected with GBV-B were re-challenged with the same virus and shown to be immune to reinfection; this immunity was long-lived and apparently more complete than immunity to HCV in chimpanzees and humans.  In additional studies to further characterize the similarity between infections by HCV and by GBV-B, in FY 2009 and FY 2010, we examined the mutation rate of acute, self-limiting versus chronic GBV-B infections in tamarins and demonstrated genetic changes similar to those observed in HCV infections.  To date, liver cancer has not been observed in chronic GBV-B infections, perhaps because chronic infections are so uncommon, but we will monitor any additional chronically infected animals for evidence of liver cancer.In 2008, in collaboration with Michael Houghton (formerly of Chiron Corp.), we tested sera from the Chiron HCV vaccine trials in chimpanzees.  Specifically, we tested serial sera from chimpanzees that had received Chiron's E1-E2 dimer vaccine (derived from the HCV-1 strain) that had been expressed from mammalian cells.  Testing was performed with pseudo-typed retrovirus particles bearing the envelope glycoproteins of each of the major HCV genotypes (HCVpp).  The magnitude of the antibody response against HCVpp bearing the envelope glycoproteins of a heterologous genotype 1a strain  (H77C) paralleled the degree of protection of the chimpanzees: those animals with a high titer of neutralizing antibody against HCVpp were protected, whereas those with a lower titer were not.  In addition, the neutralizing antibody was broadly cross-reactive, also neutralizing principally HCVpp bearing envelope glycoproteins of HCV genotypes 4a, 5a and 6a as well as those bearing the envelope glycoproteins of genoytpe 1a.We also tested in chimpanzees an HCV vaccine consisting of expressed HCV E1 protein, either with or without expressed HCV NS3 protein.  The vaccine was manufactured by Innogenetics N.V. and was tested under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the company.  In contrast to the experience with the Chiron vaccine, none of the chimpanzees was protected from infection or from persistent infection and none had neutralizing antibody to HCV as measured with the HCVpp test.  The decisive results of this study led to the abandonment of the E1 vaccine by Innogenetics.Also in 2010, we developed the chimpanzee model for norovirus infection and vaccine development.  Susceptibility of chimpanzees to Norwalk virus was reported in 1978, when oral infection was documented.  However, the animal model was not utilized again until recently.  Using the same inoculum as used in the earlier studies, we could infect chimpanzees orally but only with very high doses of virus.  We demonstrated that it was more practical to infect them intravenously, a procedure that has been used extensively for infections of nonhuman primates with hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus.  After establishing the infectivity titer of the Norwalk virus inoculum, we immunized chimpanzees with recombinant viruslike particles (VLPs) consisting of the two capsid proteins of the virus.  We demonstrated that such vaccinated chimpanzees were protected against challenge with live virus and that the protection was  Geno group-specific.  Thus, norovirus vaccines will need to be multivalent to be effective.  We next plan to determine if lack of cross protection exists within Geno groups.In 2011 we collaborated with scientists in California and Japan to study the three-dimensional structure of HEV viruslike particles bound to a specific antibody.  Such viruslike particles retained the antigenicity of the native HEV virion.  The study revealed that the monoclonal antibodies bound to the protruding domain of the capsid proteins on the lateral side of the virion's spikes.  This information will be useful for designing new hepatitis E vaccine candidates.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goals of this line of research are to develop innovative methods to treat cigarette smokers, and to understand the processes related to smoking and relapse. The proposed research is based upon a chronic disorder model of cigarette smoking that suggests that long-term treatment targeted at relapse precipitants may be useful. Based on this model, we have developed a relapse prevention treatment that uses a cognitive-behavioral framework to intervene on five areas important in relapse prevention, according to the 2000 Practice Guidelines. These areas are fluctuating motivation, depression, withdrawal, weight gain, and social support. [Data] from this line of research and [preliminary data from a] related line of research (Maintaining Abstinence in Chronic Cigarette Smokers, R01 DA015732) suggest that this targeted relapse prevention treatment provided over a one year period can produce CO-verified abstinence rates of [over 50%]. These high rates are maintained at a two year follow-up. It is important to extend these findings from a smoking research clinic to a health care setting, using recruiting procedures, personnel, and patient populations prototypical of health care settings. There is also a need to extend them to smokers with a range of medical and psychiatric disorders. Last, it will be useful to establish the effects of the targeted relapse prevention intervention on abstinence over and above those obtained with extended nonspecific supportive treatment [based on a Health Education model]. Thus, the proposed research will test a series of hypotheses about the efficacy of targeted relapse prevention treatment in relation to extended nonspecific treatment and brief treatment. Participants (N=360) are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. All participants, smokers of e10 cigarettes per day, receive 12 weeks of combined pharmacological treatment (varenicline) and group psychological intervention. During the 40 week extended treatment period, participants will receive either: (1) 40 weeks of varenicline availability + Relapse Prevention Treatment (Relapse Prevention + varenicline); (2) 40 weeks of Relapse Prevention Treatment (Relapse Prevention); (3) 40 weeks of Extended Nonspecific Treatment [based on a Health Education model (Extended Nonspecific) ]; and (4) No further treatment (Brief Treatment). Participants will be assessed at baseline on smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, depression diagnosis, alcohol problems, demographics, mood disturbance, treatment support, stress, health status, motivation for change, and licit and illicit drug use. At weeks 12, 24, 52, 64, and 104, participants will be assessed on self-reported smoking verified by carbon monoxide and cotinine assays, as well as on psychometric measures. The primary hypotheses, which posit differences between conditions, will be evaluated by GEE using intent to treat analysis. We will also test a series of secondary hypotheses that evaluate a series of moderating and mediating variables to determine more precisely how treatment is related to abstinence. If this research is successful, it will provide a treatment that produce abstinence rates considerably higher than those obtained from those currently available.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project evaluates a new treatment for cigarette smokers. In two studies to date, this treatment has produced very high abstinence rates at long-term follow-up. In the current study, we will determine whether it is the content of the treatment, or the increased contact time. We will evaluate the intervention with smokers typical of those seen in a primary care setting. We will also determine whether the abstinence rates obtained in with this treatment are enhanced by adding a new smoking treatment adjunct, varenicline. Cigarette smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the United States and innovative treatment methods are much needed. The proposed research will contribute to the development of new treatments and their assessment.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although genital human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection among young sexually active populations worldwide, no epidemiological studies of anogenital HPV infection have been conducted in Puerto Rico. Given that infection with certain types of HPV has been associated with cancer of the anus and cervix, information on the distribution of HPV types at anogenital sites is essential for the design, implementation and evaluation of vaccine studies and programs. Given the lack of available data for Puerto Rico, this study aims to determine the prevalence of cervical, anal and concurrent cervical/anal HPV infection and factors associated to HPV anogenital infection among a population-based sample of 600 women aged 18 to 64 years living in the San Juan, Metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, using a self-sampling collection methodology previously tested in a clinic-based sample population. In addition, we aim to determine the concordance of HPV types in the anus and cervix among infected women and to explore the frequency distribution of HPV variants among women with concurrent infection with HPV types 16, 18 and 31. A face-to-face interview and a computer-assisted self-interview (Audio CASI system) will collect information on risk factors for HPV infection including demographic characteristics and lifestyles. Anal and cervical specimens will be collected using Dracon swabs, which will be placed in separate 5-mL vials containing 1 mL Qiagen Specimen Sample Transport Medium (Qiagen Corp.) after collection. HPV DNA testing will be performed at the University of California, San Francisco, using a modified pool of MY09/MY11 consensus HPV L1 primers as well as primers for amplification of the human beta-globin gene. PCR products from positive samples will be typed by dot-blot hybridization using 39 individual type-specific probes. Strain variant typing from the E6 region will also be done. HPV-DNA prevalence will be calculated by HPV-type and all types combined. Crude and covariate adjusted Prevalence Odds will be estimated by logistic regression models. Three different logistic regression models will be constructed to evaluate factors associated with the following infection status: 1) anus HPV+/cervix HPV- , 2) anus HPV-/cervix HPV+, and 3) anus HPV+/cervix HPV+. On each of these models, women negative for both anal and cervical HPV infection (anal HPV-/ cervix HPV-) will be used as the reference group. Concordance of HPV-type among HPV infected individuals will be assessed by the kappa statistic and the concordance rate. This study will provide insights on the epidemiology of anogenital HPV infection and it will explore the distribution of HPV 16, 18 and 31 variants in this population in Puerto Rican women. This information is relevant to identify groups of population at risk for HPV infection and related anogenital cancers and to assess the impact of HPV vaccine programs.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will be the first to estimate the prevalence of anogenital and concurrent (anus and cervix) HPV infection, to describe the distribution of HPV types, and to assess factors associated with HPV anogenital infection in a population-based sample of Puerto Rican women. In addition we will explore the distribution of HPV 16, 18 and 31 variants in this population. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to assess anal infection among a homogenous Hispanic population in the U.S. This study will provide insights on the epidemiology of HPV infection and of the relationship between anal and cervical HPV infection in this population, information that will contribute to the development of future studies of the etiology and transmission dynamics of HPV infection in Puerto Rico. Further, it will allow us to explore the burden of HPV types currently included (6, 11, 16 and 18) and not included in the available vaccines. These assessments are necessary to understand the burden of HPV in this population, to identify groups at risk for HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV related malignancies, and to determine the impact of vaccine programs. Information on the distribution of HPV types at anogenital sites will also guide the development of effective primary and secondary prevention interventions to reduce the burden of HPV infection and anogenital cancers among the Puerto Rican population and will aid in the design and implementation of future HPV vaccines and vaccine studies in the island.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the emergence of new human viral pathogens such as the SARS virus, Nipah virus, and the avian influenza viruses, the importance of investigations on the genetic basis of viral infections becomes clear. A major goal of this lab is to study the structure and function of Sendai virus proteins as they relate to viral pathogenicity. Sendai virus is a murine parainfluenza virus similar in structure to other paramyxoviruses that continue to be a major cause of human infection in modern man. Knowledge gained from studying Sendai virus may be applied to paramyxoviruses and other similar viruses that infect man and may lead to new therapeutic interventions. Wild-type (wt) Sendai virus causes a pneumotropic infection in mice. F1-R, a pantropic variant, causes a systemic infection. We previously hypothesized that the pantropism of F1-R is due to two phenotypic differences of the virus as compared to wt virus. One difference is the enhanced proteolytic cleavability of the fusion (F) protein of F1-R which we attributed to amino acid changes in F. Another difference is the microtubule disruption and subsequent viral bipolar budding in F1-R infections which we attributed to two amino acid differences in the matrix (M) protein of the virus. To prove our hypothesis we used reverse genetics to create recombinant viruses containing various combinations of theF1-R F and M mutations. The only virus that was able to form plaques and undergo multiple rounds of replication in LLC-MK2 cells in the absence of trypsin, or cause a systemic infection in mice was RRGV0, a virus containing all F1-R M and F changes. From these studies we could conclude that changes in the F and M genes of F1-R are sufficient to allow the virus to cause a systemic infection. The first specific aim is to determine what combination of mutations in F and M are required for the virus to form plaques and/or to undergo multiple rounds of replication in LLC-MK2 cells in the absence of trypsin and to correlate these phenotypes with virulence in mice. In tissue culture infections F1-R produces fewer viruses than wt virus or RGV0. RGV0 appeared to be more pathogenic to the mice than F1-R. We hypothesize that it is due to a higher rate of virus production in the infection caused by RGV0 as compared to the F1-R infection and that this is due to changes in the P and/or L genes of F1-R. The second specific aim of this project is to create variants of Sendai virus with all F1-R F and M mutations combined with F1-R mutations in the P and/or L genes. The purpose is to identify mutations in the F1-R that contribute to the decreased virus production and decreased pathogenicity of the virus. The third specific aim of this project is to determine if the decreased production of virus in F1-R infections is due to decreased replication/transcription rates, decreases in viral assembly and budding, or decreased inhibition of the host innate responses.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the emergence of new viral human pathogens from variants of viruses that infect other animals, such as the Nipah and SARS viruses and the avian influenza virus, the importance of investigations on the genetic basis of viral infections becomes clear. The studies described in detail in this proposal provide a platform to study how changes in the genes of Sendai virus, which causes a respiratory tract infection in mice, contribute to viral pathogenesis (ability to cause disease) in tissue culture cells and in mice. Studies on the molecular mechanisms of Sendai virus infections in mice are significant in that they may provide important insights on how to more effectively control similar infections in man.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a paramyxovirus that infects essentially all persons by their second birthday. Infants experiencing their first infection are most susceptible to lower airway infection in the form of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, but older adults and immunocompromised patients also experience severe RSV disease. In addition, this virus frequently reinfects healthy, immunocompetent individuals throughout life. Disease in seropositive adults and older children is usually limited to the upper airway, but significant virus shedding has been observed at each reinfection thus maintaining the virus within an immune population. The reason for this relatively ineffective immune response to RSV infection is not well understood, but the poor immunogenicity of this pathogen has so far confounded attempts to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine. Currently there is no treatment for RSV, only transient prophylaxis in the form of a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the RSV F protein. In a new approach to RSV vaccine design we made use of a viral vector derived from an avian paramyxovirus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), chosen because it is known to be a very strong trigger for IFN-¿/¿ production in mammalian species As expected, intranasal instillation of recombinant NDV encoding the RSV F gene (NDV-F) into mice induced 1000 times more IFN-¿/¿ than did an equivalent dose of RSV, and 3 weeks after NDV-F priming mice were protected from live virus challenge. In addition, as we had hoped, NDV-F priming elicited significantly more RSV F protein-specific memory CD8+ T cells than did RSV itself. This result has now been reproduced in two additional rodent species (chinchillas and cotton rats).To test the NDV-F vaccine candidate for safety, efficacy, and establishment of long-lived protection we propose the following aims: 1) Generation of an optimized NDV-F vaccine candidate. 2) Assessment of T and B cell responses to the HRSV F protein following NDV-F priming, protection from live virus challenge, histopathology, and immunological memory in the cotton rat. 3) Assessment of T and B cell responses to the BRSV F protein following NDV-FB priming, protection from live virus challenge, histopathology, and immunological memory in the cow. 4) Large scale production of genetically stable NDV-F under GMP conditions. There is a large body of evidence to suggest that vaccinations placed in the nose may be the most effective means of protection against respiratory viruses. Our laboratory is working to develop an intranasal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, a virus responsible for the majority of nose and lung infections in children. The approach involves using Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which is not harmful to humans, to deliver pieces of RSV for processing by the immune system. This idea has worked very well in mice; one dose of the vaccine protects the animals from being infected later with RSV. In this proposal we will test this vaccine for safety and effectiveness in cotton rats and cattle, the animals who suffer a similar disease with this virus. If it appears safe and effective, we can move this into human trials.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a protective HIV vaccine would have great impact in stemming the HIV pandemic. Placebo-controlled preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trials and controlled non-human primate (NHP) vaccine challenge trials are important components of vaccine development. This renewal application proposes to continue development of novel statistical methods to address key issues in the design and analysis of such trials. Aim 1 ( Sieve Analysis ) develops statistical methods for evaluating the impact of HIV genotypic and phenotypic variation on the effects of HIV vaccines evaluated in efficacy trials. The methods build on previous work to address three key challenges: (1) ideally the sieve analysis assesses HIV sequences measured on acute-phase samples of breakthrough infected subjects, yet for some subjects only post-acute-phase sequences can be measured; (2) the analysis of longitudinal HIV sequences is needed to discriminate whether an observed difference in sequences (vaccine-vs-placebo) is due to strain-specific blockage of HIV acquisition or to post-acquisition T-cell driven HIV sequence evolution; and (3) achieving high statistical power requires that the measure of genetic distance between a subject's breakthrough sequences and the vaccine-insert sequence be highly immunologically relevant, based on T cell epitopes that a subject can recognize given his/her HLA alleles. Aim 2 ( Immune Correlates ) develops statistical methods for evaluating vaccine-induced immune responses as surrogates of protection within vaccine efficacy trials. The methods build on previous work for evaluating an immunological surrogate endpoint, with new directions to: evaluate and compare surrogate value of multiple immunological biomarkers; improve efficiency by leveraging baseline covariates; improve robustness by weakening assumptions; develop an innovative one-way crossover design; provide assumption-diagnostics and sensitivity analyses; and develop meta-analysis methods for evaluating immunological surrogates over multiple efficacy trials. The methods will be applied to the six HIV vaccine efficacy trials that have been conducted. The meta-analysis methods will also be employed to predict efficacy of influenza A H1N1 vaccines. Aim 3 ( NHP Trials ) develops statistical methods for evaluating vaccine efficacy on SIV acquisition, viral load, and survival endpoints, and for evaluating immunological surrogates for these endpoints within NHP trials. The methods (1) provide exact estimation and testing of vaccine efficacy, leveraging baseline covariates to improve efficiency; (2) address the challenge that viral load trajectories are  truncated by death;  and (3) utilize novel study designs for evaluating surrogate endpoints. This research will be developed in collaboration with international leaders in pre-clinical HIV vaccine evaluation, and will be applied to several large NHP repeated low-dose challenge trials.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a protective HIV vaccine would have great impact in stemming the HIV pandemic. Three research areas central to developing a vaccine are the evaluation of how vaccine efficacy depends on HIV sequence variability, the evaluation of whether and how measurements of vaccine-induced immune responses predict vaccine efficacy, and the evaluation of vaccine efficacy in the non-human primate (NHP) model. For making progress in these areas, this proposal develops novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trials and of NHP challenge trials.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is 3% and constitutes a major public health burden. The true incidence of acute hepatitis C is unknown, although injecting drug users (IDUs) remain the population at greatest risk in the developed world. Currently, there is no effective HCV vaccine and only 15- 45% will spontaneously clear infection. Treatment in the acute stages of infection has been shown to be highly effective in non-IDU populations; however, few large studies have specifically addressed the question of the optimal treatment regimen in IDUs, many of whom are identified through asymptomatic seroconversion rather than symptomatic acute hepatitis. In the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC) we demonstrated that subjects with recently acquired HCV infection (predominantly IDUs) can be successfully recruited, engaged and followed longitudinally. Overall, 167 individuals were enrolled and followed for up to 36 months. 76% of treatment eligible individuals (111/146) chose to commence treatment, including 37 individuals with HIV co- infection. Treatment success (defined as a sustained virological response, SVR) occurred in 55% of HCV monoinfected individuals, despite a high proportion of IDU (80%). SVR rates in the HIV/HCV group who were treated with combination therapy (peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin) were higher at 74%. Both superinfection and reinfection with HCV were observed with possible impact on treatment response rates. Although demonstrating encouraging results, evaluation of strategies to further enhance treatment response rates are obviously required, particularly among IDUs with recently acquired infection. We propose to 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy versus PEG-IFN monotherapy among individuals with recent HCV infection 2) define the incidence, risk factors and natural history of HCV superinfection during treatment and its impact on virological response and 3) determine the prevalence and complexity of HCV protease and polymerase inhibitor mutations in recently acquired infection. The study will be identified as ATAHC II and will involve a randomized clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of combination versus monotherapy for 24 weeks. The same definition for newly acquired HCV infection will be used as in ATAHC to include individuals with an estimated duration of HCV infection up to 18 months. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals will be included. The primary endpoint of the study will be SVR. Secondary virological and safety secondary endpoints will be evaluated as will the impact of treatment on injection drug use, social stability and mental health. The prevalence of mixed infection at baseline and the incidence of superinfection in those without HCV suppression in the first 12 weeks of therapy will be assessed using both standard bulk sequencing and novel methods designed to detect the presence of low level HCV quasispecies. All individuals will be assessed for the presence of protease and polymerase resistance at screening using a panel of well characterised nucleic acid mutations in the NS3 / 4a and NS5 gene regions.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus infection represents a significant global health burden affecting over 3% of the world population. In developed countries the majority of incident cases occur in injection drug users (IDUs), many of who have significant other health and social issues, and in whom uptake of treatment is generally low. Whilst most treatment studies in recently acquired HCV infection have either excluded or enrolled few IDU participants, ATAHC 1 demonstrated the feasibility and successful engagement of IDUs in treatment for acute HCV. Determining the most effective treatment strategies to enhance outcomes in this population is now required to address this important public health burden.',\n",

The South Pole ice core will be drilled to a depth of 1500 m, providing an environmental record spanning approximately 40 kyrs.  This core will be recovered using a new intermediate drill, which is under development by the U.S. Ice Drilling Design and Operations (IDDO) group in collaboration with Danish scientists.  This proposal seeks support  to provide: 1) scientific management and oversight for the South Pole ice core project, 2) personnel for ice core drilling and core processing, 3) data  management, and 3) scientific coordination and communication via scientific workshops.  The intellectual merit of the work is that the analysis of stable isotopes, atmospheric gases, and aerosol-borne chemicals in polar ice has provided unique information about the magnitude and timing of changes in climate and climate forcing through time.  The international ice core research community has articulated the goal of developing spatial arrays of ice cores across Antarctica and Greenland, allowing the reconstruction of regional patterns of climate variability in order to provide greater insight into the mechanisms driving climate change.  The broader impacts of the project include obtaining the South Pole ice core will support a wide range of ice core science projects, which will contribute to the societal need for a basic understanding of climate and the capability to predict climate and ice sheet stability on long time scales.  Second, the project will help train the next generation of ice core scientists by providing the opportunity for hands-on field and core processing experience for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  A postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington will be directly supported by this project, and many other young scientists will interact with the project through individual science proposals.  Third, the project will result in the development of a new intermediate drill which will become an important resource to US ice core science community.  This drill will have a light logistical footprint which will enable a wide range of ice core projects to be carried out that are not currently feasible.  Finally, although this project does not request funds for outreach activities, the project will  run  workshops  that  will  encourage  and  enable  proposals  for  coordinated  outreach   activities  involving the  South  Pole  ice  core  science  team.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposal is to provide proof of concept evidence that a newly-developed prototype laser system can result in dose-sparing of existing influenza (flu) vaccines without any additives. Flu continues to be a significant public health problem and is responsible for up to 3~5 million cases of severe disease and 500,000 deaths a year worldwide. It costs more than 4 billion dollars a year in the US alone. Annual vaccination still remains one of the most cost-effective means to prevent the spread of the virus and decrease flu-caused morbidity and mortality, which, however, creates a huge burden economically, clinically and manufacturally. That is because time of a new vaccine matching the antigen alteration in the circulating virus is relatively short and yet the vaccine demand is massive and continuously increasing drastically every year, in particular, during an outbreak of a new strain or pandemic of flu virus. Vaccine adjuvant can significantly reduce vaccine doses or dosages, reducing the cost enormously. Unfortunately, aluminum-based adjuvant, the only FDA-approved, widely used vaccine adjuvant in the US, failed to provide satisfactory augmentation of immune responses for flu vaccines in humans. We develop a prototype laser system capable of enhancing and prolonging immune responses against protein-based vaccines including season flu vaccine with few side effects. We are exploring this laser vaccine adjuvant (LVA) for dose- sparing of existing seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines. We will investigate whether immune protection elicited by a low dosage of season flu vaccine intradermally or intramuscularly injected into a site of laser exposure is equal to or greater than that induced by a higher dosage of the vaccine injected similarly in Balb/c and C57BL/6 (B6) mice and in minipigs to verify the feasibility of this technology in different animal species with varying skins. A similar study will also be conducted in old and young mice to corroborate that LVA can reduce vaccination doses from two to one in naive young mice and significantly enhance a respondent rate of flu vaccination in old mice. Finally, we will extend the investigation to H5N1 pandemic flu vaccine, protecting mice and ferrets from a lethal challenge of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 flu virus after one dose of the stockpiled H5N1 vaccine delivered via a combination of LVA and MF59 adjuvant. The laser  adjuvant  does not need cold chain storage or any modification to the existing vaccines, and it can be used immediately and repeatedly without a limit. These unique characters make this technology ideal for coping with flu vaccine shortages.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brief illumination of the skin with a safe laser before vaccination may result in dose-sparing of existing influenza vaccines, leading to cost-effective savings in billions of dollars each year for seasonal flu vaccines, and higher vaccine availability in the event of an influenza pandemic.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An estimate 6,800 new HIV-1 infections daily dramatically underscores the desperate need for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine. Despite significant advances in our understanding of both the humoral and cellular immune response in HIV-1 infection, the correlates of protection have still not been defined. The recent failure of the Merck vaccine trial and the unexpected modest success of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial using ALVAC-HIV (vCP1521) in a prime boost combination with AIDSVAX B/E, have challenged our notion of what constitutes a protective vaccine. Strikingly, the vaccine induced not only strong antibody responses, but also a robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell response. Approaches to induce HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses have been met with skepticism thus far as these attempts may expand the pool of HIV-1 specific CD4+ T cells targets. However, compelling studies in the lymphochoriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model suggest that virus-specific Interleukin-21 (IL21) secreting CD4+ T cell responses are a critical key factor to establish effective and long-lived virus-specific immunity. Mice lacking IL21 or IL21 receptor (IL21R) were more susceptible to chronic LCMV infection. IL21+CD4+ T cell responses have been shown to enhance cytotoxicity of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and direct antibody class switching and activation of B cells. Thus, IL21+CD4+ T cell responses play a central role in the coordination of virus-specific immunity. Surprisingly little is known about the role of IL21+ CD4+ T cells in human viral infections. Our preliminary data suggest that robust HIV-1- specific IL21+CD4+ T cell responses exist in HIV-1 elite controllers with a preferential targeting of epitopes within the Gag protein. In contrast, in subjects with chronic-progressive HIV-1 infection virtually no IL21+CD4+ T cell responses are detectable. Moreover, we have evidence that IL21 signals can transform non-controlling CD8+ T cell responses into CD8+ T cell responses with strong inhibitory activity. Thus, our preliminary data suggest that IL21+CD4+ T cell responses might be a critical factor for the generation of an effective CD8+ T cell or B cell based vaccine. Specifically we propose to: 1) Determine the presence and specificity of HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T cells as well as their role in the control of viral replication. 2) Determine whether early antiretroviral treatment in primary HIV-1 infection preserves these particular responses. 3.) Assess how HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T responses modulate HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells and enhance their capacity to inhibit viral replication. 4.) Investigate whether therapeutic CD4-targeted vaccination can induce such responses and finally 5.) assess how IL21+CD4+ T cells modulate HIV-1-specific B cell functions. The underlying hypotheses of this proposal are that HIV-1-specific IL21+ CD4+ T cells have a key function in the control of viral replication by modulating HIV-1-specific B cell function and increasing the inhibitory activity of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells. The induction and propagation of these responses in a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine will be essential for long-lived effective virus-specific immunity.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With 33 million HIV-1 infected individuals world-wide an HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed. The recent failure of the Merck vaccine trial and the unexpected modest success of a vaccine consisting of a combination of two vaccine candidates (ALVAC/AIDSVAX;  Thai trial ) drastically demonstrate our poor understanding how to develop an effective vaccine. Strikingly, the used vaccine not only induced antibodies, but also a robust HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell response. Recent data from the mouse model suggest that virus-specific Interleukin-21 (IL21)-secreting CD4+ T cell responses are critical to support virus-specific CD8+ T cell and B cell immunity. Thus in this proposal we aim to define the role of HIV-1-specific IL21+CD4+ T cell responses in the control of HIV-1 infection to determine whether the induction of these responses should be a key component of a prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human semen contains cationic amyloid fibrils, termed the  Semen Enhancer of Virus Infection  (SEVI), which strongly enhance HIV-1 infection and may play an important role in viral transmission. Our preliminary data show that amyloid-binding molecules bind to SEVI, and block semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. This suggests that (i) SEVI is responsible for semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection and (ii) SEVI represents a novel microbicide target. We therefore propose to explore a novel, innovative approach to HIV-1 microbicide development, using agents that selectively target SEVI. This high-risk/high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target the virus itself, and is expected to be highly complementary with direct antiviral approaches. Indeed, our long-term goal is to use SEVI-targeting agents in combination with traditional microbicides, to achieve optimal antiviral effectiveness. In the R21 phase, we will test whether novel amyloid-binding small molecules inhibit semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. The feasibility of this approach has been established using two amyloid-binding small molecules which contain  shielding  oligo-ethylene glycol (EG) moieties: BTA-EG4 and -EG6. These agents efficiently inhibit SEVI- and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. In Aim 1, we will generate and test novel derivatives of these and other amyloid-binding molecules, including oligovalent molecules that are expected to possess increased SEVI binding affinity. We will then test their ability to inhibit SEVI- and semen- mediated enhancement of HIV infection using a panel of R5 virus strains (including different clades and transmitted strains). In Aim 2, we will examine the interaction between novel amyloid-binding small molecules and cells from the female reproductive tract. We will evaluate whether our compounds are toxic to human cervicovaginal epithelial cells (HCEC), and we will test whether they inhibit SEVI-enhanced binding of HIV-1 to HCEC and/or SEVI-enhanced trans-infection of PBMC by HCEC exposed to HIV-1 virions. The R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved. In Aim 3, we will use structure-activity relationship (SAR) data to refine our chemical compositions. We will also test whether our lead molecules have efficacy in a cervical explant model for HIV-1 infection, and whether they have a synergistic or additive effect on the ability of other candidate microbicides to inhibit HIV-1 infection in the presence of semen. In the final Aim, we will assess the toxicity and inflammatory effects of the most promising candidate molecules, using beneficial Lactobacillus strains and cervical explants. The R33 phase will culminate with an evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the most promising compound in the rabbit vaginal irritation (RVI) model. The overall goal of these studies is to carefully determine whether small molecules that target SEVI have potential utility as a novel class of microbicides.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New approaches to prevent the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are urgently needed. This application seeks to develop a new class of microbicidal agents that are targeted not to the virus itself, but to a host protein found in semen that strongly enhances HIV-1 infection. This high risk, high reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional microbicidal strategies that target the virus, and is expected to be highly complementary with direct antiviral approaches.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical barrier for the treatment of viral encephalitis is the ability to effectively treat patients after they present to their physicians when the virus as likely infected neuronal cells. Unfortunately, neurons are typically not neuro-regenerative, so therapeutic modalities should focus on preventing the death of neurons, as well as to limit virus replication with compounds that can effectively penetrate the blood brain barrier. This project will develop a strategy to accomplish this. The purpose of the R21 phase of the project is to determine if increased calcium buffer proteins can definitively protect neuronal cells in culture and animals from West Nile virus (WNV)-induced death, and to establish the utility of specific cellular metabolites to activate calcium buffer proteins in neuronal cells. The purpose of the R33 phase is to identify the lead metabolite based on cell culture-efficacy and blood brain barrier permeability, to establish activity of the lead compound in rodents, and to investigate this therapeutic approach with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The specific aims are based on published results that WNV infection in different cell lines leads to Ca++ influx, which benefits is replication, but induces caspase 3 cleavage and increase the risk of cell death. Conversely, inhibitors of Ca++ influx decreases viral titer by >2 log10, and decreased caspase 3 cleavage. In an innovative hamster model of WN neurological disease, induction of calbindin D28k correlates with neuronal survival. Conversely, low basal levels of calbindin D28k correlates with increased TUNEL staining, and cell injury or death. Moreover, the specific metabolites to be investigated are well recognized to co-translocate to the nucleus with the receptor to activate production of calcium buffer proteins. The Specific Aims are: R21 SA #1. Test the hypothesis that calcium buffer proteins can protect neuronal cells in culture and animals from WNV-induced death. R21 SA #2. Establish a neuro- protection cell culture assay for evaluation of vitamin D3 metabolites for induction of calcium buffer proteins, and for monitoring the survival of WNV-infected neuronal cells. R33 SA #1. Identify lead candidate of vitamin D3 metabolites using the neuro-protective cell culture assay and a transendothelial permeability assay. R33 SA #2. Obtain preclinical data supporting the treatment of WNV encephalitis with lead candidate in animals with different routes of administration and treatment schedules. R33 SA #3. Determine the broad-spectrum therapeutic activity in JEV. Because of expertise in neurovirology, antiviral research, vitamin D metabolism, and calcium signaling, we are uniquely positioned to discover therapy for viral encephalitis. This project could provide new avenues of basic research for WNV and JEV neuro- pathogenesis, and enhance clinical practice for the management of WNV, JEV, and viral encephalitis in general.

To test the hypothesis that calcium buffer proteins can protect neuronal cells in culture and animals from WNV- induced death, we will correlation of neuronal survival with induction of calbindin D28k in the hamster model. We will also test if increased levels of calcium binding proteins from expression vectors will increase thesurvival of WNV-infected cells and rodents. We will establish a neuro-protection cell culture assay for evaluation of selective metabolites for induction of calcium buffer proteins, and for monitoring the survival of WNV-infected neuronal cells. Candidates will also be screened using a BBB transendothelial permeability assay. These assays will be necessary to select the most efficacious metabolite. The lead test agent will be evaluated in hamsters and in knockout transgenic mice. We will obtain preclinical data on more appropriate parenteral or oral treatment regimens in animal models. If there is evidence for animal efficacy of the lead metabolite, there is a possibility that dietary deficiency could correlate with severe neurological disease. Therefore, studies with deficient, normal and super levels of the metabolite in the diet of hamsters will be conducted. Also, serum samples from a cohort of 100 WNV patients will be assayed for the surrogate metabolite. In light of similarities of JEV with WNV, and that JEV is listed in the RFA instructions, the therapeutic calcium binding target will also be investigated fo JEV. Because of expertise in neurovirology, antiviral research, vitamin D metabolism, and calcium signaling, we are uniquely positioned to discover a therapy for viral encephalitis. This project could provide new avenues of basic research for WNV and JEV neuro-pathogenesis, and enhance clinical practice for the management of WNV, JEV, and viral encephalitis in general.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of a vaccine against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major public health priority. Of particular urgency is the need to protect newborn infants from the devastating consequences of congenital HCMV infection, including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and deafness. Recently, a subunit vaccine based on recombinant HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) showed efficacy in a clinical trial. However, it is not clear that a vaccine based on a single HCMV protein will provide robust, long-term protection, particularly for women in their childbearing years. A potential significant advantage of the live, attenuated approach to HCMV vaccines is that such vaccines could elicit an immune response that mimics natural immunity and hence provide broader protection to a wide variety of virus-encoded targets of the host immune response. However, such vaccines carry the theoretical risk of establishing latency, reactivating under conditions of immune suppression, or causing chronic HCMV-associated diseases. An approach to generate an immunogenic, yet safe live vaccine is the deletion of viral genes that subvert host defense mechanisms to infection. Using the guinea pig model of congenital CMV infection, we propose to test this approach by targeting viral genes that subvert two key host defenses: MHC I homolog genes (NK cell evasins) and protein kinase R (PKR) evasins. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated efficacy and safety of a recombinant GPCMV vaccine which had a genomic deletion of a block of MHC I homologs. We propose to identify the key viral gene involved in this attenuation and to test our hypothesis that this gene product evades host defenses by inhibition of the NK cell response (aim 1). We hypothesize this virus will demonstrate superiority immunogenicity over wild-type virus, as assessed by cytokine response, CD8+ response, and antibody titer. A recombinant virus deleted of the MHC I function, ?(MHC, will be evaluated for attenuation in animals, and immune mechanisms will be confirmed by immune assays and NK depletion studies. In the previous funding period we have also identified a GPCMV gene involved in the inactivation of PKR. We propose to characterize this and other PKR evasins (aim 2) toward the goal of generating a deletion virus incapable of inhibiting the PKR response ((PKR). We will combine PKR and MHC mutations in a single attenuated virus construct that we predict will yield a safe, highly attenuated vaccine with improved immunogenicity. Despite tight innate immune control, this (MHC/(PKR construct is hypothesized to elicit strong, long-lasting protective immunity. This concept will be further tested in the GPCMV congenital infection model by evaluating and comparing the (MHC and (MHC/(PKR vaccines (aim 3). We hypothesize these vaccines will demonstrate equal or superior protection to infection with wild-type (control) virus against congenital infection and disease. By identifying optimal attenuated vaccine strategies in the GPCMV model, the translational prospect of genetically designing a vaccine for HCMV that has strong immunogenicity and improved safety will emerge.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infectious agents can cause birth defects in newborn infants, and the most common of these infectious diseases in the United States is human cytomegalovirus (CMV). A vaccine given to a woman before pregnancy would likely prevent CMV from causing injury to the fetus and newborn infant. An attractive approach is to design a vaccine that is attenuated, meaning that the vaccine is very similar to the natural virus itself, but unable to cause disease. However, such a vaccine must be safe, so there needs to be more knowledge gained about how to modify the virus so that it is very safe, but still able to induce a strong immune response. These studies use an animal model in guinea pigs to generate this new knowledge. These studies will examine ways to engineer the CMV virus, by deleting genes that contribute to its ability to evade immune clearance, in order to design a safe vaccine that is also highly protective for the developing fetus.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I have over 12 years of experience in the area of viral pathogenesis and immunity. My doctoral studies and postdoctoral training gave me a broad understanding of poxvirus biology, and of the biology of xenotransplantation. My more recent work, which forms the basis of the science in the current application, is focused on generation and study of human monoclonal antibodies to dengue viruses. This information is of timely importance, as it is needed for the rational design of an effective dengue virus vaccine. I am also trained, and board certified, in Internal Medicine and as an Infectious Diseases clinical specialist. My long-term career goal is to remain in academic medicine as a physician-scientist and conduct translational research in immunovirology while growing my clinical skills and knowledge of infectious diseases. By utilizing the knowledge that I gain from this proposed work, I hope to develop my career in a direction independently of my mentor and begin to work on the rational design of a hepatitis C virus vaccine. My surroundings at Vanderbilt are ideal for my proposed project and my career development. The intellectual environment could not be better, and I intend to take full advantage of this by attending a structured program of coursework. My mentor's laboratory has a tremendous amount of experience isolating and studying human monoclonal antibodies, central to my proposal and to the concept of rational vaccine design. My mentor, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, also has great expertise in vaccinology, immunology, and viral pathogenesis. While at Vanderbilt and under his mentorship, my work has been rapidly evolving so as to launch my career as an independent investigator. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges in disease severity from an influenza-like illness to life-threatening shock. One model of the mechanism underlying severe disease proposes that weakly cross-reactive antibodies induced during a primary infection facilitate virus entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells during a subsequent secondary infection. This is thought to increase viral replication and release of cytokines and vasoactive mediators, culminating in shock. This unique process, known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, has significantly hindered vaccine development. There is a concern that potent neutralizing antibodies must be generated to all four dengue virus serotypes, as a vaccine that induces weakly cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies may increase the likelihood of developing severe disease upon re-exposure. Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies using mouse mAbs. However, antibody responses in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology developed in our laboratory, it is now possible to generate human hybridomas reliably with B cells from the peripheral blood of individuals who have recovered from an infection. Employing this technology, we have generated over 250 hybridomas secreting human mAbs to dengue virus from subjects who had recovered from primary or secondary infection. The vast majority of these antibodies are broadly serotype cross-reactive, directed against either envelope or pre-membrane protein, and capable of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Interestingly, very rare serotype-specific, potently neutralizing antibodies, which are nearly devoid of enhancing activity, are also produced by humans in response to infection. Understanding the epitopes and activity of these naturally-occurring antibodies is critical for vaccine development, as vaccines that induce high potency neutralizing antibodies that lack enhancing activity are desirable. Ideally, the reactivity of epitopes bound byenhancing antibodies should be reduced or eliminated in candidate antigens during the rational development of a dengue vaccine, so as to discourage such dominant recognition of these antigenic features by the humoral immune response. The long-term goal is to use such molecular information in the rational design of dengue vaccines that enhance the induction of protective neutralizing antibodies and reduce the risk of development of severe disease.  NARRATIVE: This mentored proposal outlines ambitious studies and career development, in which I will isolate potently neutralization human monoclonal antibodies to dengue viruses and determine the biochemical, structural, and genetic basis for their binding. In the process of determining fine details of the dengue virus neutralizing immune response, I will acquire skills inthe areas of virology, immunology, genetics and recombinant antibody techniques. These skills, along with didactic coursework, will help me to develop my career, as a physician-scientist, in a direction independently of my mentor.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication treatments for opiate addiction or abuse are available and effective, but each has real or perceived drawback that result in low acceptability. As a result, the vast majority of opiate addicts or abusers are not receiving pharmacotherapy for this disorder. Additional treatment options might increase the number of opiate users interested in treatment. The overall aim of this study is to develop and evaluate an opiate vaccine in rats as a potential treatment for opiate addiction or abuse. Vaccines which alter drug pharmacokinetics have shown substantial preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence of efficacy for nicotine and cocaine addiction, and several heroin vaccines have shown promise in animal models. Challenges for translating this approach to clinical use for opiate addiction include 1) providing efficacy against the wide range of commonly abused opiates, 2) avoiding blockade of key opiates needed for potential medical use, and 3) providing sufficient antibody titers to block the effects of the large doses of opiates used by addicts. We hypothesize that a multivalent opiate vaccine (MOpV) consisting of 3 immunogens, each targeting a specific group of structurally related opiates, can be designed which will attenuate the effects of a broad range of opiates yet avoid blocking non-targeted opiates. Potential advantages of an opiate vaccine, as an additional treatment option, include a long duration of action, lack of agonist effects (for those with real or perceived objections to taking an addictive medication), a novel mechanism of action and the possibility of being combined with existing medications to augment compliance or efficacy, and use in developing countries which lack the infrastructure needed to deliver agonist or partial agonist treatment. Immunogens will undergo an iterative, integrated series of developmental steps to identify and evaluate the efficacy of candidate MOpVs. Aim 1 will design appropriate haptens and optimize efficacy through the use of a variety of linkers, carrier proteins and adjuvants. Aim 2 will characterize the immunogenicity of individual immunogens and select the most effective for formulation into a single MOpV. Aim 3 will provide rapid-throughput screening of pharmacokinetic and behavioral (hot plate analgesia) efficacy in mice, identify a lead MOpV, and test the hypothesis that immunogens can be combined into a single MOpV without loss of activity. Aim 4 will characterize the effects of MOpV on opiate pharmacokinetics in a second species (rats) over a range of opiate doses and during both acute and repeated drug dosing. Aim 5 will test MOpV efficacy in blocking opiate self-administration in rats, a key behavioral model. Aim 6 will evaluate MOpV safety. These data will provide a comprehensive test of opiate vaccine feasibility, and the novel strategy of using a multivalent vaccine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heroin addiction has profound adverse effects on public health. In addition to disrupting the lives of the addict, family and friends, it is associated with crime, increased health care expenditures, and intravenous drug abuse contributes substantially to the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and other infections. Abuse of prescription opiates has also emerged as a major public health concern, with more use of these opiates currently in the U.S. than heroin, and a substantial number of users becoming addicted. Medication treatments for opiate addiction or abuse are available and effective, but each has real or perceived drawback that result in low acceptability. As a result, the vast majority of opiate addicts or abusers are not receiving medication treatment for this disorder. Alternative medications, which could provide a greater choice of therapeutic options, might increase the number of addicts electing and staying in treatment. Vaccines have been developed for nicotine or cocaine addiction whereby vaccination stimulates the production of antibodies that can bind the addictive drug and reduce the amount that reaches brain. This reduces the drug's rewarding or pleasurable effects. Three nicotine vaccines (for smokers) and one cocaine vaccine are currently in clinical trials as addiction treatments. Initial work in animals suggests that a heroin vaccine could be similarly effective. One challenge in developing an opiate vaccine is that there are many different opiates that can substitute for each other, so that a vaccine would need to block each of these. We propose to develop an opiate vaccine which can block the effects of most of the opiates that are commonly abused. This will be accomplished by taking 3 or more individual vaccines, each of which blocks certain opiates, and combining them into a single  multivalent  vaccine. Our hypothesis is that this approach will provide safe and effective blockade of opiate effects in mice or rats, and provide a vaccine that is suitable for potential clinical development. This could provide an additional type of medication for those opiate addicts or abusers who find the currently available options unacceptable, or possibly for use in addition to existing medications to enhance their efficacy.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While evidence-based treatments for opioid dependence are available, only 15 percent of affected individuals receive treatment. The availability of buprenorphine, an opioid dependence treatment approved by the FDA in 2002 with similar efficacy to methadone, was expected to lead to increased treatment rates. Although treatment rates have increased somewhat, they remain alarmingly low, leaving the majority of affected individuals at risk for adverse consequences including financial hardship, under-employment, transmission of hepatitis C and HIV, impaired driving, and crime. Restrictive insurance benefits for substance abuse may partially explain low treatment rates among the 53 percent of opioid dependent individuals with private insurance. The aim of the newly-enacted federal substance abuse parity law is to equalize private coverage for behavioral and physical illnesses. This law, which will be implemented in January 2010, has the potential to substantially affect treatment patterns for opioid dependence. However, other access-related factors are also likely to be relevant. Almost no research has focused specifically on barriers to treatment among the privately insured, and these individuals may have different financial constraints, time costs, and attitudes towards treatment compared with uninsured or publicly insured opioid dependent individuals. We propose two specific aims: (1) to study the effects of federal substance abuse parity on use of opioid dependence treatment financed by private insurance and (2) to estimate the relative importance of attributes of opioid dependence treatment on privately insured individuals' decision to enter treatment. First, we will compare treatment utilization by individuals newly covered by federal substance abuse parity regulations beginning in 2010 with treatment utilization by individuals already covered under pre-existing state substance abuse parity laws. We will adapt current substance abuse identification, treatment initiation, and treatment engagement measures to compare treatment patterns for these two groups before and after federal parity implementation. Second, we will conduct an analysis of demand for treatment by eliciting opioid dependent individuals' preferences for price and non-price related treatment attributes. We will conduct qualitative interviews to identify treatment attributes that affect the decision to enter treatment. Next, we will field a web-based survey of treatment-seeking and non-treatment-seeking opioid dependent individuals with private insurance to elicit information on the relative value of different treatment attributes and to estimate how improvements in treatment options will affect treatment rates. Both the IOM Report Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental Health and Substance- Use Conditions and NIDA's 2004 Blue Ribbon Task Force on Health Services Research identified a pressing need to improve receipt of effective services in real world settings. To transform care for opioid dependence, it is vital to identify the effects of both benefit expansion and attributes of treatment on utilization rates.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Opioid dependence is a major public health concern in the United States, with economic costs estimated at $21 billion per year. While evidence-based treatments for opioid dependence are available, only 15 percent of affected individuals receive treatment. With the goal of increasing treatment rates, this project aims to evaluate the effects of federal parity on rates of use for opioid dependence treatment and to estimate how improving treatment options will affect rates of use among the 53 percent of opioid dependent individuals with private insurance.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on development of an effective vaccine for filovirus infection, which is an etiologic agent of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever and can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat of an epidemic outbreak. We have studied the development of VLP vaccines against virus infection, and have shown that EBOV VLPs produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system, which gives high VLP production yield, exhibit DC-stimulating activity and induce strong antibody responses that neutralize EBOV GP mediated virus infection, indicating that such VLPs could be safe and effective vaccines to induce protective immunity against EBOV infection. We also found that immunization with a mixture of DNA and VLP vaccines (DNA/VLP) induced higher levels of both antibody and cellular immune responses in comparison to immunization with either alone. We hypothesize that the novel DNA/VLP vaccine will elicit strong cellular and antibody responses against filovirus infection and that the employment of a new vaccine delivery technology will further augment induction of such responses, with the aim to obtain a vaccine strategy that can confer rapid and long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 1. To improve the immunogenicity of DNA and VLP vaccines for eliciting more potent and durable protective immunity against pan-filovirus infection. We will explore different strategies to modify filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity for inducing both antibody and T cell responses as well as their production yield and will determine the immune responses that contribute to and are critical for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the microneedle (MN) technology for filovirus vaccine delivery. We will develop the technology to encapsulate filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines into bio-absorbable MNs and investigate the biological property, stability, and immunogenicity of encapsulated vaccines and investigate different geometrical designs and chemical formulations to further improve the MN vaccine delivery technology for achieving more efficient and reproducible vaccine encapsulation, and improved vaccine stability. Specific Aim 3. To compare the protective efficacy of different vaccine approaches and determine the immune correlates for protection against filovirus infection. We will compare immune responses induced by different vaccine formulations using both conventional intramuscular injection as well as the novel MN vaccine delivery technology and evaluate their protective efficacy against lethal filovirus challenge in small laboratory animal models as well as non-human primates and will determine the correlates of immune responses that are important for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. The results will set the foundation for selection of the most effective candidate vaccine strategy for GMP production and human trials. The successful development of this vaccine strategy may also be readily applied to vaccines against other viral hemorrhagic fevers which still lack effective vaccines.  Public Health Relevance: Filoviruses are etiologic agents that cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers and can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat to public health. We have recently demonstrated the combined benefit of two non-viral-vector based vaccine platforms and its potential for the development of an efficacious vaccine against EBOV infection. In this project we will further develop the novel DNA/VLP vaccine strategy for eliciting strong cellular and antibody responses against EBOV infection and develop a new vaccine delivery technology to further augment induction of such responses.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite vaccination, influenza and secondary pneumonias are the fourth leading cause of death in individuals 65 years and older. The recent emergence of the novel 2009-H1N1 influenza, to which vaccines are limited or unavailable, has the potential to cause 30,000-90,000 deaths in people under 65 years of age. These staggering statistics mandate the need to better understand age-related changes in primary immune responses to acute influenza infection. We have recently identified a critical role for natural killer (NK) cells in controlling early influenza infection ex vivo and in vivo. Aged C57BL/6 mice exhibited increased lung virus titers, weight loss, decreased NK cytotoxicity, and a reduced number of NK cells during early influenza infection. Importantly, in vivo NK cell depletion by anti-NK1.1 IgG antibody (PK136) treatment induced marked weight loss and increased lung virus titers after influenza infection of both young and aged mice. These data suggest that NK cells are essential in early control of influenza infection. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that the induction of an effective NK cell response is vital for controlling early influenza infection in vulnerable populations, including the elderly. Our studies will characterize age-related changes in NK cell function, elucidate potential intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms for impaired NK cell function, and establish the critical role of NK cells in controlling early infection to influenza virus in vivo. In Aim 1, age-related differences in susceptibility and the role of NK cell function during the first critical four days of infection will be assessed. We will perform influenza dose responses and measure age-related differences lung virus titers, pathology, histology and cellular infiltrates in lung, weight loss, and recovery from infection. Age-related changes in NK subsets, cytolytic function of NK cells, dendritic cell (DCs) function, and local and systemic cytokine production will be measured during infection. In Aim 2, we will elucidate age-related changes in intrinsic and extrinsic mechanism(s) for impaired NK cell function during influenza infection. Age-related differences in lytic efficiency, activation receptor function/signaling, and cytokine receptor/function will be measured in purified NK cells to identify intrinsic NK cell defects. Adoptive transfer studies will delineate between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on NK cell proliferation, apoptosis, and homing as related to susceptibility to influenza. We hypothesize that DCs are critical extrinsic effectors on NK cell function in early infection. Thus, we will measure DC activation of NK cells, DC cytokine production, and the effects of DC ablation on NK cell function. In Aim 3, we will validate the essential role of NK cells in controlling the in vivo response to influenza. In vivo NK cytolysis in young and aged mice will be assessed along with survival, weight loss, and lung virus titers. The specific role of NK cells in controlling susceptibility to influenza will be addressed in mice after NK depletion in vivo with PK136 or in RAG-1-/- or NKD transgenic mice. These three mouse models will afford a clear delineation of the specific contribution of NK cells in controlling the early response to influenza.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of seasonal influenza and the recent emergence of swine 2009-H1N1 mandate the need to study age-related changes in the primary response to influenza infection. Aged mice show decreased NK cell function and elevated lung virus titers during the first four days of infection, and more importantly, die prior the initiation of an adaptive primary response. If applicable to humans, this suggests that the ability of young and aged individuals to mount an early and effective NK cell response to influenza infection is vital, especially when vaccine is limited or unavailable.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Subjective tinnitus is perception of sound like ringing, buzzing, or hissing in the absence of external stimulation. Tinnitus is a significant neurological disorder that affects 51 million US citizens. There is no cure. Twelve million patients seek treatment for disturbances of sleep, affect and concentration and 3 million are unable to function occupationally. Current treatments do little to actually reduce tinnitus perception. In contrast, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method of regional brain stimulation that can significantly reduce subjective tinnitus in 50% of patients; however, the treatment effect is temporary, lasting 1 to 2 weeks after a week-long course of standard treatment. Our preliminary work indicates that this limitation can be overcome by changing the way rTMS is applied. We have observed that the rTMS effect on tinnitus is very reliable among persons who respond positively to a standard course of treatment (i.e., treatment responders) and that reapplying rTMS when tinnitus returns (i.e., maintenance treatment) produces added benefits that are sustained over time. We hypothesize that maintenance rTMS works by reversing pathological processes which are set in motion by a loss of normal sensory input (i.e., a thalamocortical dysrhythmia) and we will test this hypothesis using high density EEG recordings before and after treatment. We expect that maintenance treatment will improve tinnitus in an additive fashion and that it will impede relapse relative to standard treatment and to a sham-treatment control. We will focus the study on 30 treatment responders who will receive sham and active maintenance rTMS using a blinded study design with treatment crossover. Thirty non responders will be studied to learn what patient characteristics predict a treatment response. Maintenance treatment will consist of four, 3-day courses of rTMS separated by fixed 3-week intervals. Primary outcome measures will include a questionnaire of tinnitus severity, visual analogue ratings of tinnitus loudness and annoyance, forced- choice measures of improvement/worsening, a physically anchored measures of tinnitus frequency and loudness and the spectral power and coherence of EEG frequency bands. The timing and duration of maintenance treatment effects will be assessed by counting the number of days between the end of a course of treatment and the return of tinnitus. Follow-up assessment will be conducted at 3 months to evaluate change in the primary outcome measures and in the baseline assessments of clinical, behavioral, emotional, and perceptual aspects of tinnitus related to quality of life. Analyses will compare change scores from baseline on the primary outcome measures between standard and active maintenance treatment and between active and sham maintenance treatment. Attrition and missing data will be treated with subject replacement. This project is significant because it has potential to produce a treatment that decreases tinnitus perception chronically. Our innovative approach of using maintenance rTMS can shift current paradigms and models of how rTMS is applied in other clinical disorders treated with rTMS. We expect maintenance rTMS to benefit half of patients with tinnitus. We anticipate that these findings will support larger, multisite trials that can establish rTMS as a frst line treatment approach for tinnitus and gain FDA approval for this use.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to produce a lasting treatment for subjective tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ); a significant and disabling neurological condition tha lacks effective treatment. Tinnitus will be treated noninvasively by stimulating auditory regions o the brain with strong magnetic pulses delivered at scheduled intervals over a course of 13 weeks (i.e., Maintenance rTMS). Our unique method of applying rTMS could establish it as a first-line approach for tinnitus and possibly other clinical disorders treated with rTMS.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ideal tool for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, will be a highly effective vaccine that prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents all disease and transmission. Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a Pf sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine that prevents Pf blood stage infection in > 90% of recipients. Immunization of humans by the bites of > 103 mosquitoes introducing attenuated PfSPZ can elicit > 90% protection against infection challenge. Based on these data, Sanaria developed a vaccine composed of attenuated, purified, aseptic, cryopreserved PfSPZ, the PfSPZ Vaccine. In the 1st Phase 1 clinical trial the PfSPZ Vaccine was administered to 80 volunteers subcutaneously (SC) or intradermally (ID) and shown to be safe, well tolerated, and moderately immunogenic. However, protection against infection was low, raising questions about immunogen potency and route of administration. Subsequent studies in non-human primates (NHPs) and mice have unequivocally demonstrated that the SPZ in the PfSPZ Vaccine are highly potent, and that the poor immunogenicity was due to inefficient administration of PfSPZ. In the next clinical trials at NIH and in Tanzania, the PfSPZ Vaccine will be administered IV. In the Phase II SBIR and supplement that lead to this Competitive Renewal, we aseptically produced and cryopreserved purified PfSPZ from 3 different Pf strains, and manufactured under cGMPs a lot of one of these strains, designated PfSPZ Challenge, for infection of volunteers by ID inoculation. This work was done to facilitate the testing of malaria vaccines against challenge with multiple strains of Pf, and to create the parasite components of a multi-strain PfSPZ vaccine, if necessary. In this Competitive Renewal: lots of PfSPZ Challenge from the 2 additional strains; determine if each of the 3 strains is equally immunogenic and antigenic for CD8+ T cell induction in NHPs, and whether one of the strains is more broadly immunogenic against all strains. We also begin the development of a new approach to vaccine development called PfSPZ Challenge Vaccine, in which individuals undergoing malaria chemoprophylaxis are inoculated with PfSPZ (i.e. PfSPZ Challenge) as the approach to immunization. Each of the following capabilities - 1) to challenge volunteers immunized with PfSPZ Vaccine with multiple strains of PfSPZ Challenge by ID inoculation in multiple clinical trials centers; 2) to determine whether the immunogenicity and antigenicity of PfSPZ (PfNF54) is broadly reactive, and if not, whether Pf7G8 or PfNF135.C10 is more broadly reactive; and 3) to initiate PfSPZ Challenge Vaccine development - has the potential to reduce the time to market for the attenuated PfSPZ Vaccine or the non- attenuated PfSPZ Challenge Vaccine by at least 2 years, thereby reducing development costs by tens to perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To protect individuals against malaria and to aid in eradicating this disease, a highly effective vaccine is needed. Sanaria is in the process of developing such a vaccine: a live attenuated whole organism vaccine called the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) Vaccine. This proposal aims to broaden the protective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine by incorporating multiple strains of Pf SPZ derived from different geographic areas, and to speed progress towards licensure. The results of this study will help to make the vaccine universally effective and available more quickly for travelers and African children.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a safe vaccine to halt the HIV-1 epidemic is an urgent global public health priority. Our Seattle vaccine unit and community have devoted more than 17 years to clinical HIV vaccine development. Our accomplishments include long-standing leadership with the HVTN, an outstanding track record in volunteer enrollment and retention in phase l-lll vaccine trials, and extensive mentorship to new vaccine investigators. In this application, we renew our overall goal to accelerate HIV vaccine development by joining the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) as a single comprehensive clinical vaccine trials unit. We propose four specific aims to accomplish our goals: In Aim 1, we will provide the administrative infrastructure to conduct high quality clinical HIV vaccine research and evaluation. In Aim 2, we will contribute scientific leadership and clinical research expertise to advance HIV vaccine development through the HVTN. In Aim 3, we will partner with the Seattle community to enhance communication, education, outreach and recruitment for the successful implementation of HIV vaccine clinical research. In Aim 4, we will execute phase l-lll HIV vaccine clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. We recognize that many obstacles remain in developing a successful HIV-1 vaccine, and the Seattle HVTU will continue its commitment to seek a long-term solution to the HIV-1 epidemic.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the career goal of becoming an independent investigator, Dr. Aaron Fox describes a mentored research project and specific career development plan, which will prepare him to study interventions that improve treatment of opioid dependence post-incarceration. Following release from correctional facilities, opioid-dependent former inmates are at high risk of relapse to drug use, HIV-infection, and overdose-related death. Buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence is effective, but underutilized, which makes behavioral interventions that encourage treatment critical. This proposal aims to: 1) determine the barriers to and facilitators of initiating buprenorphine treatment post-incarcerationfor opioid-dependent former inmates, 2) to tailor an intervention, using peer mentorship, to provide BUPrenorphine Facilitated Access and Supportive Treatment (BUP-FAST) to former inmates, and 3) to pilot test the feasibility and effectiveness of BUP-FAST at increasing initiatio of buprenorphine treatment. With guidance from a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, Dr. Fox will conduct semi-structured interviews with opioid-dependent former inmates using Social Cognitive Theory as a theoretical framework to understand barriers to and facilitators of buprenorphine treatment. Based on these findings, he will tailor a previously developed intervention to encourage initiation of buprenorphine treatment by using peer mentors and targeting former inmates. The resulting intervention, BUP-FAST, will have specific components that are determined by applying Social Cognitive Theory to our findings, but we anticipate that peer mentors will provide: buprenorphine education, facilitated access to buprenorphine treatment, accompaniment to appointments, and supportive counseling. To pilot test BUP-FAST for feasibility and effectiveness, we will conduct a pilot randomized trial of BUP-FAST (vs. simple referral to buprenorphine treatment) collecting data on process measures to test feasibility and examining initiation of buprenorphine treatment to pilot test effectiveness. We hypothesize that compared to simple referral participants randomized to BUP-FAST will be more likely to initiate buprenorphine treatment. Subsequently, we will submit an R01 grant application to fully examine the effectiveness of BUP-FAST at improving buprenorphine treatment outcomes and reducing HIV-risk behaviors, opioid use, and re-incarceration in a multi-site randomized controlled trial. During the award period, Dr. Fox will pursue training in advanced qualitative methods, design of behavioral interventions, hierarchical modeling (for analysis of clustered data), and will gain experience in health care linkage following incarceration. With completion of these activities, along with intensive mentorship, Dr. Fox will be well prepared to fully test BUP-FAST and for his career goal of becoming an independent investigator.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the high rates of relapse to substance use upon release from correctional facilities, our project seeks to link opioid-addicted former inmates to buprenorphine treatment through peer mentorship. We will tailor a previously developed intervention to target former inmates and to use peer mentors. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to increase initiation of buprenorphine treatment, an effective treatment for opioid addiction, and reduce HIV risk behaviors, overdose-related deaths, and re-incarceration. This study's findings will be used to guide a large-scale study of our intervention.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood depression constitutes a major public health concern, requiring effective interventions. The effects of treatments for childhood depression are relatively modest and short-lived, with sizeable percentages of children who maintain depressive symptoms following treatment. A potential barrier to treatment success is the single uniform format of treatment protocols, addressing all depressed children similarly, regardless of clinical presentation. One strategy for addressing this barrier is to personalize treatment, fitting intervention to the specific needs of the children being targeted. This approach is consistent with the strategic plan of NIMH to emphasize the development of personalized interventions. Studies have documented the importance of family context in the development and maintenance of childhood depression; however, the limited number of clinical trials that involved caregivers provided mixed results, with only some youths benefiting from caregiver involvement in treatment. A logical first step in personalizing treatment is to develop decision rules about which children are likely to benefit from caregiver involvement in treatment, and at what point in treatment caregiver involvement should occur. The proposed K- award will take the first step toward addressing these key personalizing questions, using the Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) design, an experimental method that is well-suited to the development of personalized treatments. The proposed K-award fits well with the PI's research interests in the development and dissemination of evidence-based treatments for depressed children, and with the PI's long-term career goals of becoming an independent effectiveness and dissemination researcher in the area of childhood depression. The PI's previous research experiences include development of a psychotherapy manual focusing on positive parenting and assessing it, together with an individual CBT treatment, in two treatment studies. The proposed project will focus on the first step in the development of personalized treatment for depressed children, piloting use of the SMART design. The study has two aims. Aim 1 includes the refinement of the individual CBT and caregiver-child treatment manuals for use in the SMART trial. Refinement will be conducted using feedback from primary mentor (Dr. John Weisz) and CBT and parent training experts. Aim 2 includes a pilot study of the SMART experimental design, with 48, 8-12 year-old children who meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and/or Dysthymic Disorder. The pilot study will provide information about the acceptability of the treatment manuals, assessments, and study procedures and about the feasibility of the two-step randomization used in the SMART design. The resulting information will inform the development of a full-scale properly-powered SMART trial (to be proposed in a later application). The long-term objective is to use the SMART trial methods to guide development of personalized treatment for child depression. The PI's immediate career goals for the K-award emerge from her long-term career goals and fit well with the proposed project. Goal 1 is enhancement of training in cognitive behavioral strategies and parent training for treatment of child depression, needed for refinement of the individual and the caregiver-child treatment manuals. Goal 2 is obtaining advanced training in methods for enhancement of caregiver involvement in the treatment. Goal 3 is obtaining advanced training in innovative experimental methods, particularly the SMART experimental design, with the developer of the design (Dr. Susan Murphy, co-mentor for this project), and through coursework, workshops, and practice. Learning from Dr. Murphy will build the PI's expertise as an expert in the use of the SMART experimental design and will promote the success of the pilot study, the later full-scale SMART trial, and the development of personalized treatment for depressed children. The career training goals and the research plan outlined in this proposal will provide the PI with the experience and expertise needed for an independent research career in the field of childhood depression treatment.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child depression is among the most prevalent and impairing pediatric conditions and constitutes a major public health concern. Unfortunately, treatment benefits are relatively modest and short-lived with sizeable percentages of children who maintain depressive symptoms following treatment. This problem may be addressed in part by personalizing treatment, including determining which children will benefit from caregiver involvement in treatment. The goal of the current proposal is to pilot test an innovative experimental design called Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), which is used for development of personalized treatments, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of using this design, in preparation for a full-scale SMART in a larger clinical trial and for the development of personalized treatment.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural stem cells play a critical role in normal nervous system development and dysregulated neural stem cell death contributes to brain and spinal cord malformations, brain tumor formation, and possibly, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Cell death pathways are remarkably cell- and stimulus- specific and are dependent on interactions between an array of molecules including p53, Bcl-2 family members, caspases, and a variety of autophagy-associated proteins. In a series of studies supported by this grant, we have defined several stimulus-specific neural stem cell death pathways involving p53 and/or Puma, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. In this revised competitive renewal application, we propose a series of novel studies focused on p53 and Puma regulation of physiological and pathological neural stem cell death. In addition to the well known role of apoptotic cell death (Type I Programmed Cell Death), autophagic cell death (Type II Programmed Cell Death) has been increasingly recognized to occur under neuropathological conditions. Studies supported by our grant have demonstrated a role for p53 and Bcl-2 family members in regulating both apoptotic and autophagic cell death in neural stem cells. Our recent data indicate that neural stem cell death is triggered in vivo by a variety of pathological stimuli including genotoxic stress, hypoxic- ischemic injury, and glucocorticoid exposure. These stimuli have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human neonatal and pediatric neurological disorders. In this application, we focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptotic and autophagic neural stem cell death, with a particular emphasis on the in vivo relevance of these overlapping death pathways in two important neonatal mouse models of human neuropathology. To accomplish our goals, we will pursue three specific aims. In aim one, we will test the hypothesis that p53 is a potent regulator of autophagic stress-induced neural stem cell death through its ability to engage both Puma-dependent and -independent death pathways. Aim two will characterize the molecular pathways involved in hypoxia-ischemia-induced neural stem cell death in the neonatal mouse brain in vivo, a model of human cerebral palsy, and test the hypothesis that p53 regulates neural stem cell death, at least in part, through a transcription-independent action. Aim three will extend our preliminary studies indicating that Puma, in a p53-independent fashion, regulates glucocorticoid-induced neural stem cell death in the neonatal mouse brain, and is a likely contributor to the neurological deficits associated with human premature birth. In total, these proposed studies of novel p53- and/or Puma-dependent neural stem cell death pathways represent an important extension of our highly productive investigations of apoptotic and autophagic cell death pathways and will yield new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell death under physiological and pathological conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neural stem cells control nervous system development and too much, or too little, neural stem cell death is implicated in developmental brain malformations, brain tumor formation, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Defining the molecular pathways regulating neural stem cell death is important for understanding how the nervous system normally develops and identifying molecular targets for therapeutic interventions in a variety of human neuropathological disease states, including cerebral palsy, neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, autism, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: CSF shunt infections are extremely difficult to treat, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations, repeated shunt revision surgeries, and re-infection at rates as high as 25 percent. Our understanding of appropriate treatment of CSF shunt infection is limited and, as a result, management is highly variable. A recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop highlighted a need to optimize treatment of CSF shunt infection and prevent CSF shunt re-Infection. As a pediatrician who cares for children in the inpatient setting (pediatric hospitalist), I frequently care for children with CSF shunt infection, hydrocephalus and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The research and career development aims of this proposal will focus on the conduct of multicenter longitudinal studies, which are necessary to generate adequate sample sizes to study clinical problems in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Central to the proposed project is the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN), a philanthropically-funded, centrally coordinated research effort between four pediatric neurosurgical hospitals. My affiliation with the HCRN offers a unique opportunity for a prospective, multicenter study of CSF shunt Infection treatment with adequate sample sizes. My career development aims Include the following: 1) expand my existing skills in data acquisition and management, 2) expand my existing skills In study design, analysis, and interpretation of results, 3) learn how to measure quality of life and psychometrics to assess long-term outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, 4) learn neurobiology methodologies to better understand emerging basic neuroscience findings, and 5) develop expertise In conducting multicenter studies. These alms will facilitate my overarching career goal- to transition to an independent physician-scientist capable of performing rigorous multicenter studies needed to improve the evidence base of Inpatient health care delivered to children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that variation in medical and surgical decision-making in the treatment of CSF shunt infection results in different rates of shunt re-infections. Specific Aims include: 1) Identify patient risk factors associated with CSF shunt infection, and 2) determine the association of intravenous antibiotic duration for treatment of CSF shunt infection with CSF shunt re-infection and 3) design a multicenter randomized controlled trial for the treatment of CSF shunt infection in the HCRN.  Public Health Relevance: Children with hydrocephalus have a neurodevelopmental disorder whose principal treatment is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt placement. Shunts often require surgical revision which increases the risk of infection. CSF shunt infections lead to prolonged hospitalizations, high expenditures, repeated shunt revision surgeries, and re-infection at high rates. A recent NIH-sponsored workshop called for renewed research in hydrocephalus, including a need to optimize treatment of CSF shunt infection and prevent CSF shunt re-infection.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by selective destruction of insulin secreting beta-cells found in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Viral infection is one event proposed to initiate beta-cell damage during the development of this disease. While recent studies have begun to unravel the mechanisms by which virus infection modulates the lymphocytic response, few studies have examined the impact of virus infection on macrophage activation or the direct effects of virus infection on beta-cell function and viability. The broad goals of this research are to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which virus infection regulates macrophage activation and to determine the virus-activated pathways that contribute to the loss of beta-cell function and viability. Using a virus known to induce diabetes in susceptible mice, we have recently identified three novel antiviral signaling pathways that regulate inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. In response to a virus infection, the fate of beta-cells appears to be dependent on the response elicited, where an inflammatory response appears to result in beta-cell necrosis, and in the absence of inflammation beta-cell apoptosis ensues. There are two specific aims: 1. To test the hypothesis that the activation state of PI3K determines the response of macrophages to virus infection. When PI3K is in an activated state, virus infection stimulates the expression of inflammatory genes such as IL-1, iNOS and COX-2. When inhibited, virus infection induces macrophage apoptosis. 2. To elucidate the pathways responsible for regulating the response of beta-cells to a virus infection. Specific experiments will determine the mechanisms by which virus infection stimulates inflammatory gene expression by beta-cells, and the pathways and determinants that are responsible for beta-cell death, either by necrosis or apoptosis. A number of biochemical, molecular, immunological, histochemical, and transgenic techniques will be utilized to investigate the cellular pathways through which viral infection stimulates macrophage activation and modulates beta-cell function and viability. It is hoped that insights into regulation of macrophage and beta-cell responses to virus infection gained from these proposed studies will influence the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention of this debilitating disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to determine how human lung epithelial homeostasis is regulated in acute lung injury induced by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. Because of the rapid transmission and high potential for increased pathogenicity of the H1N1 pandemic virus, there is an urgent need to understand the host response against viral infection. This virus targets distal lung cells and causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza virus, including diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary edema. To define the mechanism of this tissue injury, it is important to study the specific cells that are infected by te virus. Therefore, our studies will focus on the cells in the alveolar region of the human lung. Ourapproach is novel in that we will study the effect of 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus on primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages isolated from the same healthy lung donors. We have preliminary data using this system that suggests the involvement of both the AIM2 inflammasome and the cytokine TSLP in host response to influenza virus infection. The AIM2 inflammasome is important for host defense against bacteria and DNA virus infection, but a role for it in RNA virus infection has not previously been identified. Here we wil determine the function and mechanism of the AIM2 inflammasome in primary human ATII cells and in a mouse model during H1N1 influenza-induced epithelial injury. We hypothesize that AIM2 is the primary inflammasome induced by influenza virus in alveolar epithelial cells. AIM2 deficient cells and AIM2 deficient mice will have more impairment of the epithelial barrier during influenza infection. TSLP plays a key role in allergic diseases such as asthma, but its effect on the epithelial barrier is not yet defined. We will determine the role of TSLP in protecting the alveolar epithelial barrier during influenza infection using both in vitro and in vivo models. We hypothesize that inflammasome activation will enhance the TSLP production by alveolar epithelial cells. Influenza-stimulated TSLP will improve the damaged barrier by influenza both in vitro and in vivo through enhancing the tight junctions between cells and/or stimulating epithelialproliferation. In addition, the cell-cell interaction between alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages will enhance the release of TSLP by epithelial cells. Our study will reveal novel mechanisms for the regulation of the alveolar epithelial barrier during acute lung injury by influenza, thereby uncovering potential novel therapeutic strategies for reducing influenza-induced mortality.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza is a common public health problem. It causes more than 35,000 deaths, 200,000 hospitalizations, and more than $37.5 billion in economic loss (www.cdc.gov). Recently, 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus led to over 18,000 verified deaths according to the WHO. The gas exchange cells deep within the human lung are the primary targets for 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. We propose to study the regulation of the influenza-induced innate immune response with a focus on the epithelial barrier. By studying influenza infection in human lung alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, our proposed studies aim to identify the regulation mechanism of lung epithelial homeostasis during influenza-induced acute lung injury and to reveal novel therapeutic agents to protect the epithelial barrier, therefore reducing influenza-induced mortality.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a devastating infection of the brain by JC virus, a virus that may remain dormant and inactive until its activation is triggered by immunological disturbances that produce immunosupression in humans. Patients affected by AIDS or immunosuppressive disorders such as cancer or rheumatological disorders are highly susceptible for developing PML. One of the most evident limiting factors in our lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of infection in PML is the lack of reliable in-vitro cell or tissue models for studying the pathobiology of JCV infection. This proposal directly addresses this critical desirable need for the development of an in-vitro brain tissue model of JCV infection. By taking advantage of surgically removed brain tissues from patients undergoing surgical treatment of epilepsy, we developed an in-vitro human organotypic brain tissue culture (HOBTC) system suitable for long-term studies of neuroglial cells, microvascular networks and neuronal-glial interactions. This proposal will further characterize the use of the in-vitro model of JCV infection in HOBTC to assess critical questions about the biology of JCV infection of neuroglia cells and cellular responses to infection, but most importantly to develop a model that may facilitate testing of potential approaches in the treatment of PML. We plan to characterize the profile of neuroglial cell responses to JCV infection in the HOBTC model and also to study the effects of HIV co-infection in the dynamic and patterns of neuroglia infection in the HOBTC model. We will study whether molecular differences and disarrangements in the JCV genome of viruses isolated from CSF of PML patients affect the dynamic and pattern of neuroglia infection in the HOBTC model. Our ability to develop an in-vitro tissue model of PML infection will improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms of JCV infection and above all identify viral and host factors that modulate and determine the pattern of infection of neuroglial cells within the CNS. That ability will also expedite the development of strategies to modify and control JCV infections and to eventually find specific treatments for PML.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare but fatal infection of the brain produced by the JC virus, a virus that may remain dormant in humans until activation produced by immunosupression. The mechanisms and modes of invasion of the brain and remain unknown due to the lack of in-vitro models. This proposal focuses on the development of an in-vitro organotypic brain tissue culture system to study the mechanisms of JCV infection of brain cells and for testing potential strategies for treatment PML.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses and their hosts have co-evolved an intricate interplay that is delicately balanced during the course of infection. The value of exploring such a natural relationship, rather than the mismatched experimental systems that currently prevail, is becoming increasingly clear. This program will focus squarely upon ectromelia virus (ECTV), a genuine mouse pathogen with several attractive properties. First, routes of transmission are similar to those of other orthopoxviridae in their natural hosts. Second, mousepox disease is remarkably similar to that of human monkeypox and smallpox. Third, some mouse strains are resistant to ECTV while others are highly susceptible, analogous to natural variations within human populations. None of this is true for vaccinia virus (VACV), an orthopoxvirus of unknown origin, frequently used in mouse models of immunity, and made all the more suspect by preliminary results presented below. Headed by three PIs with extensive experience in host defense against poxviruses, the program will comprehensively dissect the interplay between ECTV and resistant/susceptible strains of mice, referencing to VACV when appropriate. Project 1 will examine the cells and cytokines of the innate system that play critical roles in keeping the virus in check at the site of infection. Project 2 continues inspection of innate/natural immunity by examining the mechanisms by which type 1 interferons limit spread of the virus beyond the draining lymph node. Finally, Projects 2 and 3 will investigate all three major arms of the adaptive immune system to understand how they defend against primary infection and establish protection from subsequent challenge. All three projects will examine strategies by ECTV to thwart these different levels of host defense. Administrative, Biological Reagent, and Imaging Core Components will provide a wide range of support to the program, with the latter two carrying out their own exploratory projects. Our goal with this hypothesis-driven, highly interactive program is to develop an understanding of virus-host relationships that provides a framework for many other natural virus infections.   PROJECT 1: THE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO MOUSEPOX AT THE SITE OF INFECTION (Norbury, C)  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During a natural virus infection small doses of infectious virus are deposited at a peripheral infection site and then a  race  ensues, in which the replicating virus attempts to  outpace  the host's immune system. In the early phases of infection, the innate immune system must contain the infection prior to the development of an adaptive response. In Project 1 we will examine the mechanisms that are used by the innate immune system to contain infection with mousepox, a lethal mouse disease caused by ectromelia virus (ECTV), an exclusive mouse pathogen. This system is unique because it allows us to examine the innate response in susceptible and resistant mouse strains. The three Specific Aims will examine the cells that are required to slow the systemic spread of ECTV at the site of infection, the chemoattractants that mediate their migration to the site of infection and the cell biological mechanisms that are used by both the virus and the immune system during virus-cell interaction. In Aim 1 we will characterize the cellular infiltrate to the site of ECTV infection in resistant or susceptible mice and identify the innate immune effector cell types that are required to slow the systemic spread of ECTV and allow the development of an adaptive response that can clear the infection. In this aim we will also examine the effector functions that are required by innate immune cells to retard ECTV infection. In Aim 2 we will determine the chemokines and chemokine receptors expressed at the site of ECTV infection in resistant or susceptible mice, and the chemokines that are essential to attract innate effector cells that slow replication and spread of the virus. We will also study the role of immune modifiers of cellular migration encoded by ECTV in the innate response to the virus, and will identify the targets of these genes in vivo. In Aim 3 we will study the interaction of ECTV and innate immune cells in vitro, focusing primarily upon macropinocytosis, which has recently been described as the mode of infection of orthopoxviruses. Macropinocytosis has an important role in the sampling of extracellular solute for initiation of an adaptive immune response and we will examine its contribution to sampling of the environment for initiation of an innate response. We will also examine the trafficking to macropinosomes of TLR9, an innate receptor that is required for survival from ECTV challenge. The results from this Project will provide a comprehensive picture of the innate response to a peripheral virus infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This U19 research grant application responds to the Hepatitis C Cooperative Research Center (HC CRC) RFA to establish the Center for the Study of Innate Immunity to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Infection. The Center is comprised of three projects, an Administrative Core, and a Clinical Core, integrated into a Program of study aimed at defining the innate immune mechanisms that control hepatitis C virus infection and the response to antiviral therapy. HCV is a major public health problem, infecting nearly 200 million people worldwide. Most people exposed to HCV go on to develop a chronic infection that often associates with liver disease or liver failure, and can result in death. Infection with HCV is treated with alpha interferon (IFN)- based therapy but only 50% of patients respond to treatment. Thus, there is a great need to understand the basis of HCV persistence and IFN actions in order to improve HCV Infection and treatment outcome. Our studies have defined specific virus and host processes that control the hepatic innate immune response against HCV as major determinants directing the outcome of HCV infection and treatment. The studies in this U19 Program are therefore focused on the common theme of understanding hepatic innate immune programs that control HCV infection, and will investigate the overarching hypothesis that virus and host control of innate hepatic immune defenses define the outcome of HCV infection and IFN therapy. To investigate this hypothesis our Program will include studies to: Project 1) Define the viral and host genetic determinants that confer pathogen recognition of HCV, regulate hepatic innate immune triggering, and that mediate effector and evasion responses during infection; Project 2) Define the HCV/host interactions that drive hepatic IFN production and response between hepatocytes and liver dendritic cells to control HCV infection; Project 3) Determine the role of hepatic microRNA effectors in regulating hepatic innate immunity and the response to IFN therapy in HCV patients. The management for the U19 Program will be conducted though an Administrative Core. The research materials support and clinical data support for this Program will be facilitated through a Clinical Core. Overall, the proposed projects are unique to focus on understanding the virus/host interface that controls hepatic innate immunity to govern the outcome of HCV infection. Results from these studies will provide novel insights to guide the design of improved therapeutic strategies and vaccine approaches aimed at modulating HCV infection.  RELEVANCE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects the liver and causes liver disease and death. There are nearly 200 million people with HCV infection in the world but the molecular mechanisms that support infection are not understood. Our studies have now linked HCV infection with virus and host processes that control innate immunity of the liver. We propose to investigate these processes of innate immunity in order to understand how innate immune programs of the liver can control HCV infection and the outcome of antiviral therapy. Results from these studies will provide novel insights to guide the design of improved therapeutic strategies and vaccine approaches aimed at controlling HCV infection and associated liver disease.  PROJECT 1: Title: Mechanisms of Pathogen Recognition and Innate Immune Control of Hepatitis C Virus Project Leader: GALE, M.  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project 1 comprises a component of our Hepatitis C virus Cooperative Research Center (HC CRC) U19 application. The focus of Project 1 is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which HCV is recognized by the host cell as a foreign pathogen to trigger immunity against infection, and to learn how HCV evades these processes to mediate infection outcome among clinical cases of HCV. HCV is a hepatotropic virus that mediates a persistent infection and chronic liver disease in millions of people worldwide. HCV persistence is associated with viral strategies to evade innate immune defenses and a¿ interferon (IFN) immune actions that normally limit Infection. We have identified HCV genome RNA and the cellular RIG-I protein as the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and host pathogen recognition receptor that interact to trigger the expression of RIG-l-responsive genes that serve as immune effectors to control innate immunity and HCV infection. We have found that HCV can disrupt innate immune signaling via the actions of the viral NS3/4A protease, thus providing an evasion strategy that allows HCV to persist. We hypothesize that viral PAMP signaling and gene expression mediated through the RIG-I pathway are critical determinants controlling hepatic immunity and the outcome of HCV infection. Our studies are therefore deigned 1) Define the structure-function relationship of viral PAMP recognition by RIG-I among clinical isolates of HCV, 2) Identify the RIG-l-responsive genes of the liver that regulate HCV infection, and 3) Determine the function of NS3/4A to regulate the RIG-I pathway among clinical cases of HCV infected with different viral genotypes. Our studies are linked with the U19 Clinical Core, and Projects 2 and 3 to feature translational approaches aimed at defining the virus-host interface that controls hepatic innate immunity and HCV infection.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This U19 application for a Multi-Investigator Program to examine Immune Mechanisms of Virus Control focuses on the role of CD8 + effector T-cells in orchestrating clearance of virus and in the control of tissue inflammation and injury associated with the host response to virus infection. Four highly interactive and synergistic Projects and two supporting scientific cores comprise program. These projects are designed to explore the role of innate immune cells (notably natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cell/macrophages) and their products in regulating the development of effector CD8 + T cells which can efficiently eliminates virus/virus infected cells and control excess and potentially injurious inflammation associated with T cell recognition of viruses at different sites of infection. The Specific Aims of the Program fulfill several of the stated Aims of the RFA including understanding and defining the role of innate immune cells in regulating adaptive responses at different sites of virus infection.' This Program also deals with a topic as important as effective virus clearance that is the control of tissue inflammation and injury and explores the contribution of intrinsic mechanisms of control of tissue inflammation and injury exhibited by effector CD8 + T cells (i.e. effector T cell derived I L-10 and inhibitory NK receptor expression by the effector T cells). The Program brings together project leaders with unique expertise and diverse and complementary skills in the areas of Viral Immunology, Mammalian Genetics, Virology and Clinical Medicine. The individual Project Leaders and Core Directors have both prior and ongoing collaborations. In this program we proposed to examine the following questions: How does I L-10 (interleukin-10) produced by antiviral CD8 + effector T-cells affect virus clearance and control lung inflammation in acute respiratory virus infection and what factors control the production of this regulatory cytokine by effector T-cells (Project 1)?; 2. What is the nature of the defect in the CD8 + T-cell effector response to hepatotropic virus infection and adaptive immune induction in the liver and how do liver NK cells (and liver dendritic cell-NK cell interactions) regulate the magnitude and the quality of the CD8 + T cell response (Project 2)7; 3. How does NK cell mediated control of early virus replication at the site of infection in a secondary lymphoid organ i.e. the spleen, and the activation state of the NK cells, affect virus elimination and the tempo and quality of the antiviral CD8 + T cell response (Project 3)?; 4. What are the factors that control the expression of an inhibitory NK-type receptor NKG2A on CD8 + effector T cells and how does that engagement of this inhibitory receptor control excess Inflammation and inhibit immune pathology in the virus infected lungs (Project 4)?   PROJECT 1: lnterleukin-10 in acute respiratory virus infection (Braciale, T)  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary inflammation and injury is a frequent (and, in some instances, lethal) outcome of virus infections of the respiratory tract. Respiratory virus infection triggers a coordinated response from the host innate and adaptive immune systems. The host response is essential for virus clearance and recovery, but is also a significant cause of pulmonary injury that can accompany virus elimination. Relevant recent examples of this are the immune-mediated lung inflammation/injury observed in human infections with the SARS coronavirus and the H5N1 avian influenza viruses. The long-term goal of Project 1 is to define and characterize the interactions between cells of the innate immune system i.e. dendritic cells, monocyte/ macrophage, NK cells and adaptive immune effector T lymphocytes (Te) in the process of virus clearance and in the control of inflammation/injury during experimental virus infection of the respiratory tract.  The foundation for this application is our recent and unexpected findings in the murine model of type A influenza infection that anti-viral effector T-cells (both CD4 +Te and more prominently CD8 +Te) infiltrating the infected lungs produce high levels of the anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokines IL-10 during the Te response to infection and virus elimination. Furthermore, we found that blocking the effect of Te-derived IL- 10 during infection results in increased pulmonary inflammation and lethal injury. Our evidence further suggests that this Te-derived IL-10 plays a central role in controlling the level of lung inflammation/injury produced by mononuclear cells infiltrating the infected lungs in response to virus infection and the proinflammatory mediators released by virus- immune (Te). We wish to analyze the expression and regulation of IL-10 and specifically Te-derived IL-10 in the infected lungs and the impact of this cytokine on the control of virus clearance and lung inflammation/injury. The aims of Project 1 are: 1. To evaluate the cellular sources and effects of IL-10 on influenza virus infection; 2. To analyze the regulation of IL-10 production by Te during influenza infection; 3. To determine the impact of viral infection on the production of Te-derived IL- 10. The proposed studies are designed to complement ongoing related studies in Projects 2, 3 and 4.\",\n",
       " \"This application is responsive to: PA-07-089 HIV Infection of the Central Nervous System andpartially responsive to: PA-07-338 HIV Treatment Adherence Research. Co-infection with thehuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a burgeoning healthcareconcern, as approximately one third of all HIV-infected patients in the United States are co-infectedwith HCV. Infection with HIV and HCV can give rise to a host of cognitive, psychiatric and centralnervous system abnormalities. Increasingly, there is reason to believe that HCV, even in theabsence of HIV or other cormorbid conditions, is itself neuropathogenic. The main treatment forHCV is pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV). Treatment success is linked towhether patients can tolerate prescribed dosages and duration of therapy. Research has yet tofocus on whether patients may miss or skip doses, an analogous situation to what has been wellstudied in HIV mono-infection. Given the relatively low rates of sustaining HCV remission(approximately 40-50%) and given the difficulty of taking a potent combination of medications for asustained period of time (most will be on treatment for 48 weeks), it is reasonable to assume thatsuboptimal adherence might share some responsibility for treatment failure.This five year longitudinal study seeks to determine: (1) The impact of treatment with PEG-IFN/RBV on neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, and neuroimaging parameters and the degree towhich comorbid HIV infection alters this response; (2) whether participants who achieve a SVRdemonstrate statistically and clinically significant improvements in neuro-function compared tobaseline performance and (3) the degree to which adherence to participants' anti-HCV medicationregimen impacts neural function as well as the likelihood of obtaining a sustained virologicresponse. We are particularly interested in determining how (or if) co-morbid HIV infection altersthe expression of treatment related neuro-changes. We will enroll 330 participants, 165 who areHIV/HCV co-infected and 165 who are HCV mono-infected in order to obtain an ultimate sample of200 participants who complete therapy. Study participants will be evaluated with a series ofneuropsychological and psychiatric measures prior to beginning treatment, 12 weeks aftertreatment has been initiated, and then 12 weeks following treatment completion. A nested cohortwill undergo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) ateach study timepoint. We will employ growth modeling and multiple group path analysis as theprimary analytic techniques. Project Narrative: Co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) is increasingly recognized as a pressing public health concern as the number ofdeaths due to HCV will soon outpace deaths due to HIV in the United States. While there aremedications for HCV that are frequently effective, these drugs are also toxic and may adverselyaffect brain function and cause problems with medication adherence. This study will determine howco-infection with both HIV and HCV affects the brain, how treatment for HCV affects brain function,and how adherence to HCV medications affects response to treatment and neurological functions.Of particular interest is how HIV co-infection affects response to treatment.\",\n",
       " \"This is a renewal of the REU site at the Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (LAR) at Washington State University (WSU), which for many years has successfully engaged undergraduate students in research activities involving atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate change.  Ten students will be recruited each summer, targeting underrepresented communities in the Pacific Northwest (including Northwest Indian College and Columbia Basin College) and students funded through WSU's Undergraduate Research Opportunity (URO) program.  During the 9.5-week program, students will participate in several half-day workshops focusing on atmospheric chemistry, measurement and modeling techniques, data interpretation, and scientific communication.  In parallel with the workshops, students will be trained on the specific research tools required for their individual projects and will conduct these projects under the mentorship of faculty and graduate students.  The individual projects will be part of LAR externally-funded research programs that focus on current problems in atmospheric chemistry.  The summer will culminate with poster presentations at the WSU Undergraduate Research Symposium. The focus on atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate change will foster the participants' appreciation for the importance of interdisciplinary and collaborative research.  It will also encourage some students to pursue graduate school opportunities and careers in an environmental field.  By targeting underrepresented groups outside WSU, the REU renewal will help increase diversity both within the program and across broader engineering and scientific disciplines.  Before, during, and after their summer at WSU, REU participants will be interviewed to determine how their views of research were affected by the program.  This assessment of the program's impact on participants' beliefs and perspectives regarding scientific research will contribute to the broader education community and also help guide future REU programs nationally.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opiate abuse and overdose have surged in the past 15 years. Drug overdose, mostly from opiates, is now the US' second leading cause of accidental death. Most drug abuse treatment systems use passive approaches to link drug abusers to treatment, resulting in delayed entry into treatment, often subsequent to adverse impacts on health and society. Major structural and motivational barriers impede opiate abusers' engagement in treatment. Recent healthcare reform legislation presents opportunities to test proactive, public health approaches to identifying and linking drug abusers to treatment. While screening and brief intervention (BI) have shown effectiveness in addressing alcohol abuse in healthcare settings, research suggests that for those drug dependent, there is a need for enhanced BI and linkage to specialty treatment. Opiate abusers disproportionately use emergency medical services (EMS), as they do EDs, and our research suggests a significant number refuse transport to EDs. While EMS systems are in a prime position to intervene on drug abuse, few currently do so. Research suggests drug abusers may be motivated to engage in treatment at times of health emergencies, and that brief intervention (BI), free treatment, and incentives may further enhance treatment entry. In a prior study, EMS providers' discussing drug treatment with patients at times of overdose was associated with their entering treatment. Yet only 17% of EMS providers discussed treatment then, representing a missed opportunity for intervention. The proposed study tests the feasibility and effects on opiate abuse treatment entry of a novel EMS approach to drug abuse screening, and coordinated, enhanced BI to improve current linkage to treatment practices. All participants will be given vouchers for free treatment and active referral for on-demand treatment at any of the city's treatment facilities through the Baltimore City Health Department's (BCHD's) usual practice, a treatment information and referral (I&R) phone line. The half of participants randomized to the incentive arm will receive a nominal tangible incentive for treatment entry confirmed by record review. The study will compare outcomes across study arms and to a matched sample of I&R clients who (self-) refer using usual linkage to opiate abuse treatment practices. The study is enabled by electronic information systems seldom used in drug abuse treatment research. The academic-interagency collaboration builds on study team members' decades of successful relevant research with the study population. .  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the dearth of rigorous studies on universal screening and brief intervention to link drug abusers to drug treatment. The study uses a novel EMS approach and capitalizes on recent healthcare reform legislation, and early implementation at the study site, that expands funding streams and availability of drug abuse treatment. Findings will inform policymakers on a low cost, high impact model for linking acute care seeking opiate abusers to treatment, with implications to patient outcomes and healthcare costs.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a looming threat to human health. A safe and effective vaccine is the best way to prevent large-scale outbreaks in the human population. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, causes kennel cough in dogs, but is not known to cause any illness in humans. PIV5 can be produced in high titers (up to 8x108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml) in many cells including Vero cells, which are WHO approved for vaccine production. PIV5 can infect human cell lines as well as primary human cells. In our preliminary studies, a single dosage of 104 PFU of a live recombinant PIV5 expressing a HA gene from the H3 subtype provided immunity against influenza A virus subtype 3 infection in mice. We hypothesize that PIV5 is a good vector for vaccine development and we propose to test PIV5 as a vector for H5N1 vaccine. We will focus our efforts on following specific aims: 1. Testing recombinant PIV5 expressing HA of H5N1 (PIV5-H5) as a vaccine for H5N1; 2. Testing the potential of other H5N1 proteins expressed using PIV5 as antigens for vaccine; and 3. Testing mutant PIV5 viruses as vaccine vectors.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza A virus causes significant morbidity and mortality each year. Strains currently circulating in humans (i.e. H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) infect up to 15% of the world population and cause an average of 36,000 deaths and 226,000 hospitalizations in the United States (28), as well as millions deaths world wide. Sporadic outbreaks of pandemic influenza have caused significant mortality over the past century, most notably the Spanish flu of 1918, and have caused over 50 million deaths world wide. On the horizon is another potentially pandemic strain of influenza, H5N1. This avian influenza virus has most notably emerged in Southeast Asia and resulted in the destruction of millions of birds, infected 309 people, caused 187 human fatalities since 2003 (WHO, Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO, 31 May 2007), and threatens to become the next pandemic.  Currently, the only FDA-approved vaccine against H5N1 has serious limitations, particularly as it has to be given twice and requires substantial higher concentrations of the vaccine to achieve a moderate level of efficacy compared to conventional influenza vaccines. Conventional vaccines utilizing the HA and NA of H5N1 viruses have been poorly immunogenic and have safety and production issues. A live-attenuated H5N1 vaccine has been generated by reverse genetics, but the risk of generating a reassortant prohibits use of this vaccine in most instances. Inactivated virus vaccines have also been derived by reverse genetics and produced in large quantities, but preliminary results from NIAID clinical trials suggest that efficacy will require both multiple immunizations and 6 times the standard influenza virus antigen dose, i.e. 90 ug instead of 15 ug of antigen while only providing protection in a subset (~50%) of vaccinated individuals. Nonetheless, FDA has recently approved the inactivated H5N1 vaccine for use in people between age 18 and 64, an age group that is not the most vulnerable to influenza virus infection. Thus, there is a rationale need for new vaccine strategies that provide increased immunogenicity and safety.  Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, causes kennel cough in dogs, but is not known to cause any illness in humans. PIV5 can be produced in high titers (up to 8x108 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml) in many cells including Vero cells, which are WHO-approved for vaccine production. PIV5 can infect human cell lines as well as primary human cells. In our preliminary studies, a single dosage of 104 PFU of a live recombinant PIV5 expressing a HA gene from the H3 subtype provided immunity against influenza A virus subtype 3 infection in mice. In this proposal, we hypothesize that PIV5 is a good vector for vaccine development and we propose to test PIV5 as a vector for H5N1 vaccine.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease and death in humans. H5N1 is spreading rapidly in bird populations world-wide and there is great concern that this virus will begin to transmit between people and cause a global pandemic catastrophe. Vaccines are the cornerstone strategy for combating avian flu but there are complex challenges facing us today including, (1) the inability to manufacture the vast numbers of safe and effective doses needed to prevent infection on a world-wide scale; (2) the fact that the current vaccines are ineffective and require large doses, and (3), virus strains are continually changing, which complicates vaccine strain selection. TRIA Bioscience Corp. is developing a novel adjuvanted vaccine for pandemic H5N1 Flu that should solve many of the scientific and technological barriers confronting this field. The vaccine antigen is recombinant H5 haemagglutinin (rH5), which uses a production process that simplifies many of the manufacturing issues associated with conventional vaccines, and the adjuvant (GLA-SE) that combines two clinically-validated strategies for augmenting vaccine performance, a synthetic Toll-Like Receptor-4 agonist, GLA, and an oil-in-water emulsion, SE. We are building on our compelling Phase I SBIR data by proposing activities leading up through an IND. First, we will compare GLA-SE activity against two simpler GLA-formulations designed to streamline adjuvant development and regulatory approval. Second, we will establish vaccine protection in ferret challenge models and establish safety and immunogenicity end-points in non-human primates. Third, we will manufacture and release cGMP-grade H5 protein and adjuvant, and obtain FDA clearance for a Phase I clinical trial. The results from this study will provide a relevant measure of dose sparing for vaccine manufacturers and inform clinicians about a new tool for inducing broad immunity against drifted strains of H5N1 virus. The US and world governments are investing billions of dollars in pandemic preparedness measures and TRIA will be well-positioned to participate in this market. This vaccine's design is broadly applicable to other infectious diseases, which increases its commercial potential even further.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several new tolerance induction protocols have brought us closer to achieving allograft survival in the absence of chronic immunosuppression. However, virus infection poses a threat to the allotolerant state because it can disrupt immunoregulation and induce cross-reactive allospecific T cells through a process termed  heterologous immunity.  Studies performed by this Program have defined the temporal relationship of viral infection to the success of tolerance induction and to the durability of healed-in grafts. They have revealed the crucial role of alloreactive CD8+ cell deletion and the ability of viral infection to abort this critical process, and have revealed the key role of heterologous immunity after infection as a generator of primed alloreactive memory cells. The theme of this Program is to understand the reciprocal interaction of transplantation tolerance and virus infection. The Program's goal is to understand the mechanisms behind each of the discoveries that we have made using viruses and TLR agonists as probes into the nature of transplantation tolerance. Project 1 will focus on mechanisms by which infection compromises the induction of transplantation tolerance. Project 2 will focus on mechanisms that compromise the maintenance of transplantation tolerance. Project 3 will carry the studies of Projects 1 and 2 to the molecular level. The specific focus of this project is to define the molecular mechanism of CD8 T cell apoptosis. Project 4 will bridge between murine studies of Projects 1-3 and human transplantation immunology. The project will study common human viruses known to affect human allograft survival using  humanized mice.  Addition of two new investigators to this revised Program now brings innovative siRNA in vivo delivery technology for blockade of CD40-CD154 interaction in both mice and in human immune systems in humanized mice. The Program will be supported by a Virology and Technology Core that will provide viruses, virological and immunological analyses and new technologies to identify and quantify alloreactive T cells and by a Mouse and Transplantation Core that will provide necessary mouse resources, perform and train Program personnel in transplantation, and monitor infected animals and grafts in biocontainment. The goal of these studies is to discover mechanisms that determine graft survival in the face of infection and innate immune activation.  RELEVANCE: This research will investigate mechanisms underlying the induction of transplantation tolerance and graft survival in the absence of immunosuppression and how infection may modulate this process   PROJECT 1: Title: - Mechanisms of Transplantation Tolerance Induction Project Leader: GREINER, D  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanisms underlying the complex interrelationships of infection and graft survival during induction and maintenance of transplantation tolerance are not well understood. Our goal is to understand how infection blocks the induction of peripheral and central tolerance. We have developed several innovative technologies for identifying virus-immune T cells and determining their anti-viral and cross-reactive alloreactivity at the single cell level. We have also developed methods for 1) quantifying alloreactive T cells using a 'synchimera' model based on CD8+ TCR Tg mice, 2) identifying naive and effector alloreactive T cells by their rapid production of cytokines following alloantigen stimulation, and 3) quantifying in vivo CD8 T cell effector function using an in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We will use these techniques with an exciting new technology for in vivo delivery of siRNA to block of CD40-CD154 interaction. These new technologies will allow us to test our overall hypothesis that induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN1 is a fundamental mechanism by which innate immune activation modulates the induction of peripheral and central tolerance. Specific Aim 1 is to determine mechanisms by which TLR ligation or virus infection modulates the induction of peripheral tolerance. We will test the hypothesis that innate immune activation by TLR agonists or virus infection abrogates the induction of peripheral tolerance through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN1. Specific Aim 2 is to determine mechanisms by which TLR ligation or virus infection modulates establishment of hematopoietic chimerism and central tolerance. We will test the hypothesis that the induction of peripheral and central tolerance involves multiple different but overlapping mechanisms. This project should reveal the mechanism(s) by which infection compromises the induction of peripheral and central transplantation tolerance. This Project will interact closely with Project 2 studying the maintenance of tolerance, and Project 3 studying how alloreactive CD8 T cells die by apoptosis following costimulation blockade. These discoveries will be translated to human immune systems in Project 4 using both the Viral and Technology Core and Animal Core as critical resources for the accomplishment of our research goals.  RELEVANCE: As new drugs for prolonging graft survival in patients are implemented in the clinic, the safety and efficacy of these new drugs in the face of environmental insults such as infections are not known. This work will identify how infection during transplantation may affect the host immune system and ultimate fate of the graft.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A and B viruses have tremendous socioeconomic consequences, for influenza continues to occur in regular epidemics and occasional pandemics and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was a wake-up call that influenza is still a continuing threat. Of continuing great concern today is the highly virulent avian H5N1 influenza virus that is still circulating among birds and transmitting to humans in parts of Far East Asia. Each year in the USA, in the absence of the introduction of pandemic influenza, seasonal influenza kills 36,000 people, hospitalizes 114,000 and causes 70 million missed work days and 38 million lost school days. It is estimated the loss to the economy is $3-15 billion. In the years of introduction of pandemic influenza virus, 1957 and 1967, approximately 70% of the US population was infected and in 1918/19 the estimate of death associated with Spanish influenza range from 20-40 million (1 in 100 people). Thus, there remains a need for efficient control of influenza virus by a new generation of vaccines or specific chemotherapeutics agents. The aim of this grant application is to study the mechanism of influenza virus assembly. The direct relevance of this research to public health is that knowledge gained on the assembly mechanism of influenza virus provides new targets for anti-viral drug development. Among the least understood aspects of influenza virus replication are the events that allow the formation of virus particles and the pinching off o these particles by membrane fission. Recently, we have found a new role for the influenza virus M2 proton-selective ion channel protein in mediating virus budding. Our data indicate that an amphipathic helix (AH) in the M2 cytoplasmic tail mediates the final steps of budding for influenza viruses causing membrane scission and bypassing the need for using host cell proteins, as needed for budding of some other enveloped viruses e.g. HIV. We will perform a rigorous analysis of the function of the M2 cytoplasmic tail AH by generating a defined range of mutants in the AH and creating novel influenza viruses by reverse genetics. We will analyze the mutant viruses for changes in properties of the M2 protein function. We will analyze and reconstitute influenza virus budding in vitro and in vivo using assays that are well established inthe field of membrane biophysics but are under utilized in the field of virology and that we have developed in our laboratory. We will analyze virus assembly in vivo by isolating membrane sheets. This permits, by using immuno-gold EM, examination of the temporal and spatial relationships between integral and membrane-associated viral proteins. This will provide major insight into the organization of the region of the plasma membrane involved in virus budding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza virus remains an important viral pathogen of significant medical importance with pandemics occurring in 1918, 1957 and 2009: the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was a wake-up call that influenza is still a continuing threat and justifying that influenza virus is classified as a Select Agent Category C, because of its ability to cause great morbidity and mortality. Thus, there remains a need for efficient control of influenza virus by a new generation of vaccines or specific chemotherapeutics agents. The aim of this grant application is to study the mechanism of influenza virus assembly and the direct relevance of this research to public health is that knowledge gained on the assembly mechanism of influenza virus provides new targets for anti-viral drug development.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A high-growth PR8 virus for pandemic vaccine production in ST6-Vero cells. In 2009, the traditional means of vaccine manufacturing for the H1N1 influenza pandemic failed to yield sufficient doses during the peak of the crisis. A vaccine production method that can universally accommodate variant strains of virus in much shorter timelines would greaty benefit the interdiction of a growing pandemic threat. Cell-based production systems have been proposed to replace the protracted egg-based processes. Cell culture-based technology is robust, reliable and is a more rapid and efficient alternative to egg-based technology for vaccine producers. For pandemic vaccine production, distinct advantages of cell-based over egg-based vaccine production are speed (12 weeks), capacity (kg scale) and versatility (quick response to new antigens) so that production lots with significantly higher viru yields may be obtained in nearly half of the time. Despite great promise, no cell-based system has been approved for use by the FDA and technical barriers currently exist in the use of cell lines for manufacturing of flu vaccine. These barriers are 1) limited virus production from currentcell systems, and 2) reliance on cell lines that spontaneously form tumors in vivo. To overcome these challenging barriers, FluGen Inc. has generated a Vero cell line that stably expresses the human 2,6 sialyltransferase gene I necessary for generation of human-specific influenza receptors (ST6-Vero). ST6-Veros offer greater infection rates with virus isolated from clinical samples than normal Vero cells. ST6-Vero also may be grown to highly packed cell densities in commercial bioreactors thereby providing more host cells for viral replication. The goal of this proposal is to generate a high-growth donor A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (HG-PR8) virus to further enhance viral propagation in FluGen's ST6-Vero cells. The specific aims of the Phase I project are to 1) generate a high-growth PR8 donor virus by serial passaging in ST6-Vero cells; 2) demonstrate increased productivity of ST6-Vero cells by producing HGPR8- H1N1 vaccine virus in scaled-up suspension cultures; and 3) confirm the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the ST6-Vero produced HGPR8-H1N1 pandemic virus by demonstrating protection in mice. Upon completion of these Phase I aims, a HG-PR8/ST6-Vero cell-based vaccine production system will be realized that is capable of yielding extraordinary titers of 109 pfu/ml, and triggering theexpected immune response, as evidenced by protection of mice by viral challenge. For Phase II, qualification of the ST6-Vero cell line and method development for scaling up the process of producing H1N1 pandemic vaccine under GMP conditions will be pursued. The intended commercial product is a licensable platform vaccine production system that can rapidly produce pandemic vaccine efficiently and at very high titers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high-growth PR8 virus for pandemic vaccine production in ST6-Vero cells. In 2009, the traditional means of vaccine manufacturing in eggs failed to yield sufficient doses during the peak of the H1N1 influenza pandemic crisis. FluGen Inc. proposes to engineer a cell-based vaccine manufacturing system with the highest rate of production in the industry for these Phase I investigations. Our proprietary ST6-Vero cell line stably expresses the human ?2,6 sialyltransferase gene I necessary for generation of human-specific influenza receptors. ST6-Vero cells result in increased virus yields and hence produce greater amounts of hemagglutinin than normal Vero cells. ST6-Vero also may be grown to highly packed cell densities in commercial bioreactors thereby providing more host cells for viral replication. To enhance cell-based productivity even further, we will generate a high-growth A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (HGPR8) donor virus specific for ST6-Vero which will confer high viral growth property in ST6-Vero cells. The combination of the high replication of HGPR8 in highly infectable ST6-Vero cells that may be grown to immense densities will provide a rapid and high yielding vaccine production system.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this SBIR AT application is to develop a multi-adjuvant liposomal vaccine formulation that targets dendritic cells and can be applied to our current vaccine programs. The innovation is a dual adjuvant system where VesiVax(R) lipid vesicles are formulated with a TLR9 agonist (CpG) and CD40 Ligand fused to the Company's proprietary Hydrophobic Domain (HD) technology. The formulations, including testing of single adjuvants, will be assessed with influenza and Herpes Simplex 2 viral antigens in vivo in proven mouse models. We have shown that the TLR4 agonist, MPL has an immunostimulatory effect and hypothesize that other TLR agonists and receptor-binding ligands will influence the immune response elicited by target antigens. The ultimate goal of this program is to build an immunogenic liposome formulation that is broadly applicable to antigens, regardless of whether a predominantly Th1 or Th2 type of immune response is desired. The optimal formulation will be utilized to advance an influenza or Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2) vaccine candidate towards the clinic. Vaccines based on the VesiVax(R) system can be engineered using two formats: 1) a target antigen or adjuvant protein can be engineered to be expressed as a fusion protein with the HD which facilitates incorporation directly into the liposome or; 2) a target antigen or adjuvant in the form of a peptide or carbohydrate that can be attached via conjugation to the surface of the liposomes, or conjugatable adjuvant lipid vesicles (CALVs). The Company has assembled an internal team, as well as an external collaborator, with expertise in key core competencies in recombinant protein production, understanding structural and functional interactions of proteins and peptides with lipid bilayers in order to prepare liposomes with the appropriate properties, and to analyze the liposomes and lipid, protein, and adjuvant components to confirm the composition. Our collaborator for the proposed in vivo studies has been testing VesiVax(R)-TLR4 vaccines in established challenge models for influenza and HSV2. The approach to evaluating the proposed dual adjuvant system involves creating the CD40L and TLR9 adjuvanted formulations and testing their effect formulated in vaccines containing the influenza M2e or HSV2 gD antigens. Using methods already developed by the Company for M2e-HD and gD-HD, we will prepare CD40L as an HD fusion expressed in E. coli, and we will prepare the selected CpG oligonucleotide sequence either synthesized coupled to a lipid or with a free thiol or free amine on the end to attach to lipid. We will use ou published female mouse model of intravaginal HSV2 infection and mouse influenza intranasal challenge model. These models will allow us to test each adjuvant in separate formulations as well as combined. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the combination of the two adjuvants will stimulate stronger protective immune responses, thus leading to an optimized commercial formulation for our vaccine programs. The first Milestone in this proposal is the production of liposomes formulated with CpG, CD40L-HD, and both CpG and CD40L-HD. The second Milestone is the choice of an optimal formulation by testing in the two infectious disease models. In Phase 2, we will develop commercial production and analytical methods and conduct nonclinical Pharmacology/Toxicology studies to support the filing of an IND. A secondary application of the new adjuvant system would be to make it available to vaccinologists and immunologists in a kit format. A Foresight Science & Technology market research report entitled  Liposomal Adjuvant for Vaccine Research  was commissioned by the Company. The report identified lipid-based adjuvants as having a  very broad range of potential applications and corresponding to more than 80% of the market for vaccines in development, which is estimated to reach more than $18 billion by 2015.  Using this statistic, it is estimated that the total addressable market for lipid-based adjuvants may be over $14.4 billion by 2015.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With the continued emergence of new pathogens, the prevalence of certain viral infections, and the threat of bioterrorism, it is imperative to continu to optimize vaccine performance. Molecular Express is developing vaccines to two viral targets, influenza A virus (IAV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2). Herpes genitalis caused by HSV2 is one of the most common, sexually transmitted diseases in humans, with as many as 1 out of 6 Americans having been infected. The disease affects both normal and immunosuppressed adults, and is associated with increased susceptibility to the human immunodeficiency virus, serious clinical disease in neonates following transmission of virus from their infected mothers, and increased likelihood of developing cervical cancer versus non-infected women. IAV infections have caused the deaths of millions of humans worldwide. While generally effective against individual viral subtypes, vaccines that protect against infection by IAV are difficult to manufacture rapidly and demonstrate limited activity against different subtypes due to antigenic shift and drift in the surface antigens of the virus. In addition, the recent emergence of highly virulent strains of IAV could result in a devastating human pandemic before effective vaccine candidates could be developed. Vaccines that provide broad protection against infection with emerging strains of IAV and are manufactured in a manner that allows the vaccine to be rapidly and effectively updated in response to new strains of IAV would be a major advance. Clearly there are critical needs to develop effective vaccines against these two diseases. There is unexplored potential to optimize our current influenza A virus (IAV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2) vaccine candidates by targeting immunostimulation through Dendritic Cell (DC) activating pathways. We will track the immunostimulatory properties of vaccine formulations using established in vivo viral challenge models. We hypothesize that by combining a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, CpG, with CD40 Ligand, DC cells will facilitate an augmented response to VesiVax(R) liposomal vaccines. Testing of the DC-targeted dual adjuvant approach will be conducted on two vaccines, IAV Matrix 2 protein ectodomain (L-M2e1-15-HD) and HSV2 surface glycoprotein (L-gD1-306), which generates predominantly Th2 and predominantly Th1 responses, respectively. The goal of this project is to understand and optimize vaccine formulations that are broadly applicable to our vaccine programs. Thus, successful execution of the studies proposed in this application could lead to new and/or improved vaccines for treatment of a variety of infectious diseases or cancers.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza and other infectious diseases are a major cause of death in the US and world-wide. Vaccination is the most cost-effective strategy to prevent these diseases. Although much progress has been made in vaccine technology, the timely design, validation and production of vaccines remains a major hurdle for the vaccine industry. The development of recombinant methods for the expression of subunit vaccines has impacted development timelines and costs but subunit vaccines frequently are not as potent as virus particles in eliciting an immune response. Virus like particles or VLPs represent one approach to bridge this potency gap but the design, expression and purification of VLPs remains problematic and the development of uniform tools to aid in vaccine production is elusive with existing technologies. In this proposal we describe a novel cassette technology of integrating recombinant proteins into the structure of VLPs. The prototype system defined in this proposal will generate VLPs using the influenza hemagglutinin as an immunogen. The potency of the VLP vaccine will be tested in animals in comparison to a monomeric hemagglutinin.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The influenza virus is highly infectious and causes both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. A pandemic outbreak of a highly lethal strain would cause millions of deaths worldwide. Vaccines are the most cost- effective strategy to prevent infection. New strategies are required to produce more effective vaccines and to expedite the development time for new vaccines. Our goal is to develop a novel technology for the design and development of virus like particles that can be used in vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid Test for Recent HIV Infection and Incidence Panels for Assay Evaluation Project Summary Accurate estimates of HIV incidence are required for monitoring the epidemic, for targeting resources, and for evaluating the effectiveness of various interventions. Yet the assays that underlie these estimates are widely understood to be flawed. Among the flaws are (1) the lack of consistent recency detection across HIV subtypes, (2) inconsistent availability of commercial test methods that have been modified to discriminate recent from long-standing infection, (3) difficulties to date in adapting incidence methods to test formats usable in resource-poor settings, and (4) lack of incidence panels (plasma samples from individuals with closely estimated infection dates) in sufficient volume for evaluation of multiple candidate assays. In this project, we propose to transform serological HIV incidence testing from the current ELISA methodology to a reliable lateral flow rapid test format with good coverage of all HIV subtypes and a low false recency rate. The rapid test will be stable, multi-colored, fast, simple to use, and applicable to populations where varyin HIV subtypes are dominant. We also plan development of pedigreed incidence plasma panels for evaluation of this new test method; panels will be made commercially available worldwide. These products will be based on three key assets: a new highly sensitive rapid test technology based on a novel colorimetric detection system, which allows for analysis of antibody titer and avidity within a single cassette, to be applied for the first time to an incidence test for HIV; a ew HIV antigen (rIDR-M) which combines immunodominant sequences corresponding to all major subtypes; and a proven, IRB-approved protocol for identifying, recruiting, and retaining recently HIV infected individuals for blood collections to form incidence panels. The new colorimetric detection technology for rapid test yields bright, high-contrast, multicolor bands on a membrane. The sensitivity of this method far exceeds that of conventional colloidal gold or similar labels used in lateral flow rapid tests, as well as exceeding the sensitivity of comparable ELISA assays. The new rapid test method will be based on avidity and has been demonstrated to distinguish between incident and prevalent samples. The incidence panels to be generated concurrently will provide the essential tool with which to characterize the performance of the rapid test as well as other candidate incidence methods. In Phase I, we expect to complete development and validation of a prototype rapid test and establish six incidence serum panels. Additional panels, including multiple clades, will be collected in Phase II to support final development and characterization of a commercial version of the rapid HIV incidence test.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rapid Test for Recent HIV Infection and Incidence Panels for Assay Evaluation Project Narrative SeraCare and Immunetics propose jointly to develop a new, rapid HIV incidence test for discrimination of recent vs. past infections by all HIV subtypes worldwide. Incidence/prevalence panels of well-characterized plasma from recently HIV infected individuals will be collected for use in qualifying this assay and will be made available commercially to other investigators and test developers. Development of a rapid and reliable test for recent HIV infection is a critical public health need for accurate determination of HIV incidence and will allow epidemiologists and researchers to understand whether HIV infection is increasing, decreasing, or staying level within a given population, greatly advancing the monitoring of interventions to reduce the spread of HIV worldwide.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the research proposed is to create a new RNA virus vaccine using a novel self-assembling nanoparticle packaging method, designed to overcome safety, cost and other limitations that slow vaccine development. Virus-based vaccines have the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity, which can improve vaccine potency compared to other methods of vaccine delivery. RNA virus based vaccines have improved safety compared to DNA virus vaccines because they can't integrate into the host genome, but are still limited by cell-based capsid packaging methods that are costly and limit vaccine boosting. Our preliminary data show that by removing all native capsid assembly constraints self-assembling vaccines can be made with improved safety, vaccine stability, and at very low cost, simply by mixing RNA and coat protein together. The Specific Aims of this research plan are 1) to modify the insect Flock House Virus RNA genome with a non-native capsid origin of assembly and confirm in vitro particle formation, 2) to insert a foreig reporter transgene under the control of a virus promoter and evaluate the protein accumulation in cells, and 3) to combine the transgene expression and nanoparticle self-assembly, and to confirm that both are functional. The resulting product is a viral RNA vaccine with packaging characteristics independent of its native capsid, while retaining the virus characteristics that make it a good vaccine antigen. That includes nM particulate size for optimal antigen uptake by immune cells, stability at room temperature for years, and the ability to safely carry viral transgene expression into immune cells without the risk of virus reconstitution. Flock House Virus was selected for self-assembly because it also has many desirable characteristics. It is not a mammalian pathogen, and thus will exhibit improved safety. It has very high levels of antigen expression in mammalian cell types, and greatly reduced cell death compared to RNA viruses currently used in vaccine development. Flock House Virus has not been previously exploited for vaccine development because the native capsid packaging characteristics significantly limit transgene insert size and the virus particles still need to be made in cell culture. The expected outcome of this application will be to overcome native capsid packaging limitations, and create a self-assembling RNA nanoparticle based on the Flock House Virus genome, with high level antigen expression. Our research is significant, because it will fulfill our long-term objective tocreate cost effective, safe and robust RNA vaccines, and it is innovative because we will validate that any RNA virus with desirable characteristics can be adapted for nanoparticle self- assembly, and increase the pace of RNA vaccine development for human use.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving vaccine characteristics by rational design is a high priority of research scientists and the medical community, because vaccines play a critical role in improving public health. This R03 application seeks to improve vaccine characteristics by testing a new type of self-assembling RNA vaccine nanoparticle, which unlike currently approved vaccines, is rapidly and easily made, is stable at room temperature, and can be made cost effectively. Our goal is to implement improved RNA based vaccines that can be used clinically, and this will have a positive impact on improved safety, superior immune activation and protection against infectious disease pathogens and cancer, and may facilitate widespread adoption of new vaccines in the future.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus targets distal lung cells and causes diffuse alveolar damage in severe and fatal cases. Recent studies and our preliminary data indicate that there is variation in host susceptibility to this virus amon humans. Although animal studies provide valuable information on the effect of host genetic factors on the susceptibility to influenza, this information does not translate readily into the human situation and clinical medicine. We still do not know how the virus evades the host defense to cause lung injury in certain individuals, largely because it is difficult to study influnza patients directly. To address this issue, we have developed a primary culture system for human lung alveolar epithelial cells, the key targets for pandemic and avian flu. This will allow us to study the host response to influenza infection in the cells from deidentified donors. Our previous study indicates that interferon (IFN)-l is the predominant IFN produced by these cells during influenza infection. Additionally, a functional polymorphism in the IFN-l gene has been shown to be related to the outcome of viral clearance and responsiveness to hepatitis C virus in humans. However, whether this IFN-l polymorphism affects host response to respiratory viral infections is not known. In the proposed study, we will determine how the critical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12979860 in the IFN-l3 gene affects host response to H1N1 pdm virus in human primary lung alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, we will investigate the role of IFN-l ininfluenza-induced epithelial injury in these cells. We hypothesize that SNP rs12979860 TT is associated with increased susceptibility to influenza infection and nonresponsiveness to IFN- l treatment. Our approach has three major novel features. First, studying the host response to the pandemic flu in our unique human primary culture system allows us to directly study the most relevant targets for the flu virus. Second, we will study the effect of the functional SNP in IFN-l on alveolar epithelial cell susceptibility to influenza and influenza-induced epithelial injury durng influenza infection. Third, we will study the function of IFN-l in limiting virus-induced epithelia injury. IFN-l is well known for its antiviral activity in epithelial cells, but whether it protectsthe epithelial barrier has not been studied. Our study will reveal novel information on the host genetic factors involved in regulating susceptibility and response to influenza infection, therefor providing novel approaches to improve influenza prevention strategies and develop better treatments for influenza- induced pathology.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement Influenza is a common public health problem responsible annually for more than 35,000 deaths, 200,000 hospitalizations, and more than $37.5 billion in economic loss (www.cdc.gov). According to the WHO, the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus led to over 18,000 verified deaths worldwide. This virus targets cells deep within the human lung that are responsible for gas exchange. However, the degree of clinical illness is highly variable, and therefore there must be some factors that alter host susceptibility. The proposed studies aim to determine whether variations in a key host antiviral factor, interferon-lambda, affect susceptibility of primary human lung epithelial cells to influenz infection and infection-induced lung injury. Results from these studies will reveal valuable information about risk factors within a population susceptible to influenza infection and provide novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of influenza-induced disease.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection, and infection rates are highest in African Americans. CT infection causes major reproductive morbidity in women. Control measures have not diminished the epidemic; a vaccine is urgently needed. CT vaccine development has been hindered by inadequate knowledge of immunogenetic factors influencing protective immunity in humans. Murine models reveal CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses and Th1 chemokine receptor expression are essential for protective immunity to CT, while Th2 responses impair immunity; however, differences between animal models makes translating findings to humans challenging. Human studies reveal cellular immune responses to CT, but rarely have responses contributing to protective immunity been studied; access to well-characterized cohorts is a major obstacle. Some at risk individuals do not have CT re-infection, likely in some because immunogenetic factors mediate protection. Sparse data suggests genetic determinants influence risk for re-infection, but underlying immune pathways remain elusive. Our long range goal is to bridge gaps in knowledge of immunogenetic factors mediating protective immunity to CT in humans. Preliminary studies in a well-characterized cohort of CT-infected women revealed: 1) CT re-infection in 15% by 6 months after therapy and 2) women without re-infection more often had CT-specific Th1 responses (IFN-3 and TNF-1) and expression of Th1 chemokine receptor CCR5 and less often HLA-DQB1*05 and IL10 gene variants. Our overall hypothesis is that CT-specific systemic and mucosal Th1 cytokine responses (mainly IFN-3 and TNF-1) and chemokine responses and also expression of Th1 chemokine receptors will be associated with decreased CT re-infection risk, while select HLA class II alleles and IL10 gene variants will be associated with increased re-infection risk. Our approach to verify the hypothesis consists of three specific aims: 1) Demonstrate that CT re-infection risk is reduced in women with a CT-specific CD4+ Th1 response (mainly IFN-3 and TNF-1), 2) Determine the phenotype of systemic and mucosal T cell subsets associated with CT re- infection risk in women, and 3) Delineate and further refine associations of HLA Class II alleles and IL10 gene variants with re-infection in women. CT-infected women from a well-characterized population will be enrolled and undergo repeat CT testing at 3- and 6-month visits. Systemic and mucosal immunological studies (of CT- specific cytokine and chemokine responses and T cell phenotype distributions) as well as targeted HLA class II and IL10 gene variant typing and genetic data analyses will be carried out in subjects with and without CT re- infection. The goal of the proposal is to elucidate cellular immune responses and cell phenotypes associated with protective immunity to CT re-infection in humans, and to expand our understanding of the relationship of immune correlates with genetic variants that influence re-infection risk. Study findings should provide systemic and mucosal immune correlates of protection needed for CT vaccine studies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite prevention and control measures, Chlamydia trachomatis infection remains the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection and causes major reproductive morbidity. The goal of the proposal is to elucidate systemic and mucosal cellular immune responses and cell phenotypes associated with protective immunity to chlamydia re-infection in humans, and expand our understanding of the influence of genetic determinants and the associated immune pathways that mediate protective immunity. Study findings should provide knowledge that can advance chlamydia vaccine development.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 37,000 people die in the U.S. each year just due to seasonal influenza outbreaks. Efforts to match each year's batch of prevailing influenza viruses fail to predict the strains that will spread in the U.S. 23% of the time. The influenza season of 2007-2008 was one example of the mismatch between prediction and actual strain prevalence. In that season, two of the three influenza strains were mismatched with the viruses that spread in the population leading to influenza infections in vaccinated individuals Therefore, year to year seasonal influenza antigen prediction is not optimal. Beyond seasonal influenza, more troubling is that it is impossible to predict the next pandemic strain of influenzadespite our greatest attempts to monitor new out breaks. Even if the strain could be determined at the onset of the pandemic, the time needed to develop and produce an effective vaccine for world-wide distribution may take too long to provide a protective vaccine to the world population. We propose to create and test  centralized  influenza genes for the production of prophylactic cross-reactive immunity to combat both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Centralized antigens are antigens that have been computationally engineered to represent common or primordial antigen sequences shared by many or all current viral antigen variants. The advantage of using a centralized antigen is that the genetic distance from the vaccine strain to the challenge strain is half of that of a random antigen and a challenge strain. Therefore, unlike selected wildtype candidate antigens, centralized antigens have substantially higher general homology to all strains of influenza, increasing their ability to drive cross-reactive immune responses to control influenza variants. The specific aims of this study are 1) to create reassorted influenza viruses expressing centralized genes. These will include hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for H1, H2, H3, H5, N1 and N2 subtypes. The centralized viruses (H1N1-con, H2N2-con, H3N2-con, and H5N1-con) will be used to make traditional inactivated vaccines. 2) In order to determine the most broadly protective vaccine, mice will be immunized with centralized and wildtype inactivated vaccines. The immunized mice will be challenged with divergent influenza viruses and the best vaccine will be determined by the ability to induce the broadest levels of protection. 3) The final goal of the study is to determine the effects of using a centralized influenza vaccine in the context of prior anti-influenza immunity. Vaccine safety is paramount and these studies will determine if boosting with centralized vaccines results in original antigeni sin and dominant non-neutralizing immune responses. A final analysis will be done in ferrets, since ferrets more closely resemble natural influenza infection in humans. The overall goal of this project is to determine if a centralized vaccine is capable of inducing cross-protective immunity against influenza virus with greater breadth than that of a traditional influenza antigen.The most broadly protective antigens, whether centralized or wildtype, could be used as a first line defense or backup vaccine against pandemic or  weaponized  influenza viruses in the case of vaccine mismatch or could be incorporated into the annual vaccine formulation.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is impossible to create a perfect vaccine year after year. In fact, every year there is a greater than 1 in 5 chance that the vaccine will be a mismatch. The risk of vaccine mismatch is amplified exponentially in the event of a global pandemic with virus such as the H5 avian or  bird flu  virus. Since, we cannot predict with 100% certainty what the circulating virus will be every year; we propose to create centralized influenza virus genes that most closely resemble all influenza virus genes within a subtype. We believe these genes will provide superior cross-protective immunity in the case of a vaccine mismatch.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mumps virus (MuV), a paramyxovirus, causes acute inflammatory infections in humans involving most organ systems. Mumps virus infection was the most common cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis before mass immunization with the mumps virus vaccine. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a single dose immunization of MuV vaccine in 1977 and in 1989 ACIP recommended to increase MuV vaccine to two doses. Even with widespread vaccination programs in place, mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The largest MuV outbreak in the US after implementation of two-dose MuV vaccination program occurred in 2006. It is considered the first failure of two-dose MuV vaccination. In 2010, a large MuV outbreak occurred in NY/NJ area. While definitive causes for the outbreaks are not known, possible reasons (not mutually exclusive) for these outbreaks include (1) waning immunity and (2) vaccine failure due to emergence of a new mumps virus strain. The fact that outbreaks had occurred in populations with over 95% coverage of two-dose MuV vaccine strongly suggests that the current vaccine is not effective. The current vaccine is based on genotype A while outbreaks were caused by genotype G MuV. All these possible causes indicate a need for a new vaccine that is effective against current outbreak strain of mumps virus. Long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a new mumps virus vaccine with long-lasting immunity. We hypothesize that MuV mutants generated using reverse genetics system are good vaccine candidates. We propose to develop a novel mumps virus vaccine by attenuating virus through introducing mutations at desirable locations within the genome and to test immunogenicity of vaccine candidates in mice and ferrets.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current mumps virus vaccine (JL strain) based on genotype A has been used for over 40 years. Recently, large outbreaks in vaccinated populations have occurred at increasing frequency. The outbreaks of mumps virus (genotype G) infection in vaccinated populations underscore the urgency and importance of developing a new and effective vaccine against mumps virus (genotype G) that caused current outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dengue virus (DENV) represents an emerging/re-emerging infectious disease that causes significant human morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that there are 25 to 100 million cases of DENV infection each year and 2.5 billion people are at risk. Children and infants in endemic countries account for the majority of the 25,000 DENV-associated deaths that occur annually. There is currently no commercial vaccine available. We have developed an innovative vaccine platform that has shown in vivo efficacy against lethal flavivirus infection in two independent models (West Nile virus and Yellow Fever virus) and in this application we will expand on this foundation to develop and produce a new tetravalent vaccine against DENV. The critical obstacle faced by current approaches to live attenuated DENV vaccine development is viral interference, a phenomenon in which the host preferentially mounts an immune response to one or two (but not all) of the four DENV serotypes, leaving the vaccinated subject either unprotected or at potentially increased risk for severe disease if exposed to the wrong DENV serotype. To resolve this problem, our approach utilizes previously attenuated DENV vaccine strains (shown to be safe in human subjects) followed by inactivation with our proprietary hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based vaccine technology to prepare highly immunogenic formulations with the potential to elicit a balanced immune response to all four DENV serotypes. This vaccine project encompasses many of the key product development goals listed in RFA-AI-11-014 including, lead vaccine candidate optimization; evaluation of safety, toxicity, and immunogenicity; evaluation of efficacy in appropriate challenge models; evaluation of stability at optimal and elevated storage temperatures; and cGMP manufacturing of vaccine material suitable for completing all applicable IND-enabling preclinical studies. The successful completion of these objectives will result in cGMP-grade vaccine material suitable for future initiation of a Phase I clinical trial, acrucial milestone in the advancement of a human vaccine for this important NIAID Category A Priority Pathogen.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly infectious member of the paramyxovirus family causing upper and lower respiratory tract infections. RSV infection is the leading cause of pulmonary disease of the lower respiratory tract (bronchiolitis, pneumonia and respiratory failure) in infants due to virus-induced airway damage and complex inflammatory processes and responsible for an estimated 160,000 deaths annually worldwide. RSV also causes morbidity and mortality to the immunocompromised and elderly populations. In the United States, an estimated 70,000 to 125,000 infants are hospitalized annually with RSV pneumonia or bronchiolitis resulting in costs that may well exceed US$400 million annually. Because of either low immunogenicity and/or for safety reasons, previous attempts to formulate a vaccine to prevent RSV-mediated disease have not been successful. The formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate (FI-RSV) induced severe disease upon subsequent natural infection with RSV. Vaccinated children were found to suffer from enhanced disease severity and even death upon subsequent RSV infection concomitant with pulmonary eosinophilia. Severe lung inflammatory responses characterized by a skewed CD4+ T-cell response (in the absence of neutralizing antibodies) and the influx of eosinophils in the lung were detected. Because of the unmet need of a safe and effective RSV vaccine, novel approaches are desperately needed. We have developed a patented mucosal vaccination platform that has demonstrated potent immune responses and protection against two different, mucosally challenged viruses. This powerful vaccine regimen can generate a Th1 biased, broad and potent humoral, mucosal and T cell responses including substantial mucosal secretory IgA and CTL. The uniqueness of our patented immunization regimen are:1) both mucosal (especially mucosal neutralizing antibodies), systemic immune responses and complete mucosal protection were raised without using any virus vectors and/or toxic adjuvants; 2) no immunopathology or vaccine- enhanced diseases have been detected in virus challenged animals. Two patents on the platform technology have been granted. Mucosal HSV-2 vaccine patents are pending and being licensed to a vaccine developer for further product development. Therefore, this mucosal vaccine platform is an ideal candidate for developing a mucosal vaccine that protects against pathogens which enter at mucosal surfaces, as is the case for RSV. Using this patented mucosal immunization strategy, a safe and effective RSV vaccine will be developed. A strong scientific team involves four collaborating Institutes including: Biomedical Research Models, Inc., St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Iowa and Sigmovir Biosystem, Inc. will: 1) prepare and optimize vaccine formulations to be tested in both BALB/c mice and cotton rats, 2) perform immunogenicity and protection studies in both mice and cotton rats of RSV intranasal infection, 3) test the durability of immune protection and the cross-subtype protection, 4) evaluate the safety (pulmonary histopathology) of the RSV vaccine candidate in both BALB/c mouse and the cotton rat models.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Public Health Service (PHS) has recognized the significant public health issues caused by RSV. Due to the seriousness of RSV infection caused morbidity and mortality and the lack of a safe and effective RSV vaccine, development of novel approaches to RSV vaccination is desperately needed. The development of a safe and effective Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine would provide protection to infants and elderly populations under the threat of RSV infection. The reduced incidence of disease in the lower respiratory tract would reduce the amount of medical costs directly associated with the infection.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid misuse and addiction are significant and increasing problems in the United States. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with sublingual buprenorphine became available in the United States in 2003 and has significantly expanded access to and participation in opioid agonist treatment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) published treatment guidelines to support practitioners providing this new treatment, but early studies suggest significant variations in practice patterns and only modest adoption of recommended practices. The purpose of this study is to utilize administrative data to evaluate the quality of buprenorphine treatment for Medicaid beneficiaries. Our specific aims are: 1) to describe to what degree current treatment adheres to the treatment guidelines; 2) to determine which patient level factors such as age, gender and medical and psychiatric co-morbidities are associated with receiving higher quality care, and; 3) to investigate if receiving care according to treatment guidelines is associated with retention in treatment or future utilization of high intensity substance abuse treatment services. For aim 1, we will describe what percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries who were prescribed buprenorphine received outpatient physician visits, outpatient behavioral health treatment, laboratory screening for liver disease, drug testing and medication dosing at the levels recommended in the guidelines. For aim 2, we will rely on logistic and Poisson regression to explore whether meeting these quality indicators is associated with patient level factors. Finally, for aim 3, using Cox proportional hazards models we will measure the association between receiving care according to treatment guidelines and outcomes such as treatment retention and future treatment service utilization. The study will include approximately 12,400 Medicaid beneficiaries who received buprenorphine for opioid addiction between 2003 and 2009. It will be the first study to explore the use of administrative data to assess the quality of buprenorphine treatment. Because both the number of people addicted to opioids and the rates of participation in buprenorphine treatment are expected to rise, this information will be essential to Medicaid program managers and policy makers working to provide access to treatment while maintaining quality and controlling cost.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Buprenorphine treatment has significantly expanded access to and participation in opioid agonist therapy, but few studies have evaluated the quality of buprenorphine treatment in real world settings. The purpose of this study is to utilize a large administrative dataset to evaluate the quality of buprenorphine treatment for Medicaid beneficiaries defined as adherence to national treatment guidelines. We will also investigate associations between receiving guideline concordant care, treatment retention and utilization of high intensity substance abuse treatment resources. We believe that this is the first study to evaluate buprenorphine treatment quality on a large scale using administrative data and that this information is critical for developing evidence-based treatment guidelines, quality measures and regulatory structures.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ebola virus (EboV) and Marburg virus (MarV) are filamentous enveloped non-segmented negative sense RNA viruses representing the two genera that comprise the family Filoviridae. These viruses are important human pathogens with case fatality rates ranging from 55% to 90% for EboV and up to 90% for MarV. These agents are classified as Category A Priority Pathogens by the NIAID/NIH and CDC, and there are presently no approved active or passive interventions for exposure resulting from natural outbreak, laboratory accident, or deliberate misuse. Public health concern is based on both the emerging infectious disease status of these viruses and their potential use as biologic weapons. An effective prophylactic vaccine would find application with medical personnel and close contacts during outbreaks in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa, with laboratory workers engaged in filovirus research, and with military and civilian personnel threatened by weaponized filoviruses. The ideal vaccine to meet both the outbreak and bio-weapon scenarios would rapidly confer protection against all species of EboV and MarV with a single administration. Among the vaccine technologies investigated to date, a tri-valent filovirus vaccine vectored by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) has shown the greatest potential as a single administration vaccine with the capacity to rapidly provide broad protection against EboV and MarV. Profectus BioSciences has developed a replication competent attenuated rVSV vaccine delivery platform (rVSVN4CT1) that: 1) retains the immunogenicity of vaccines based on the non-attenuated vector, 2) has been manufactured under cGMPs at commercial scale, and 3) has been judged by the FDA to be safe for human testing. Thus, this application proposes: 1) to confirm that an attenuated tri-valent rVSVN4CT1 vectored filovirus vaccine will protect monkeys against challenge with EboV and MarV, 2) compliantly prepare seed stocks of the three viruses in the vaccine under conditions that will support future manufacture under cGMPs, 3) use the compliant seed stocks to prepare tri-valent vaccine that will be tested in a GLP neuro-toxicology study in non-human primates to confirm safety, 4) use the compliant tri-valent vaccine in development studies to identify a lyophilized formulation with the stability characteristics required for practical field use, and 5) test the lyophilized tri-valent vaccine to confirm that itprotects NHPs from EboV and MarV when administered pre-exposure and post-exposure.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ebola virus (EboV) and Marburg virus (MarV) are filamentous enveloped non-segmented negative sense RNA viruses representing the two genera that comprise the family Filoviridae. These viruses are important human pathogens with case fatality rates ranging from 55% to 90% for EboV and up to 90% for MarV.

An effective prophylactic vaccine would find application with medical personnel and close contacts during outbreaks in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa, with laboratory workers engaged in filovirus research, and with military and civilian personnel threatened by weaponized filoviruses. The studies under this application propose to develop and test a vaccine vectored with vesicular stomatitis virus that will protect against infection with EboV and MarV.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality. They undergo a lytic, productive infection at the mucosal sites and spread into sensory ganglia, where they undergo a latent infection for the life of the host. Reactivation leads to recurrent infection and disease. Antiviral drugs have been defined that inhibit the lytic infection cycle, but there are no approaches that target the latent virus. We hav defined the role of viral gene products such as LAT and ICP0 in modulating the chromatin structure during lytic and latent infection, but further basic information is needed about these mechanisms for discovery of therapeutics that target HSV latent infection. In this application our specific aims are: a. To test hypotheses for possible mechanisms by which the HSV latency-associated transcript reduces lytic gene expression during acute infection and during latent infection of trigeminal ganglia: a. LAT mutations give different phenotypes in different HSV-1 strains. b. LAT acts as a long noncoding RNA that recruits histone-modifying complexes to the viral genome. c. LAT leads to chromatin changes by serving as a precursor to an miRNA that reduces ICP0 expression through studies of miRNA mutant viruses. d. LAT transcription, rather than cis-acting regulatory DNA sequences, promotes chromatin on the viral lytic genes. 2. To define the mechanisms by which the HSV ICP0 protein regulates chromatin structure during acute infection and latent infection of trigeminal ganglia. We have exciting unpublished results that ICP0 mutant viruses have a different chromatin profile on their genome during latent infection. We will test the hypothesis that ICP0 acts to alter the chromatin state by recruiting histone modification enzymes to viral and cellular genes. 3. To define Interactions between LAT and ICP0 in regulating HSV chromatin. We will test the hypothesis that LAT forms duplex RNA with ICP0 transcripts to recruit histone modifying enzymes by mutating the ICP0 promoter or mutating the ICP0 translational initiation site and by constructing LAT and ICP0 double mutant viruses to determine their combinatorial effects on latent infection, and viral chromatin.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Herpes simplex viruses cause considerable genital, ocular and nervous system disease, and genital herpes increases the risk of HIV infection. There are drugs that target the active growth of herpes simplex virus but none that target the latent infection. This research will define basic mechanisms of herpes simplex virus latent infection and new targets for potential drugs to treat the latent infection of these viruses',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of an effective HIV vaccine is the long-term solution to control HIV/AIDS world-wide. The failure of adenovirus type 5 based HIV-1 vaccines in humans that was designed to elicit primarily antiviral T cells strongly suggests the need to develop novel vaccine approaches that generate high levels of antiviral T cells with improved function as well as protective antibody. Development of novel adjuvants is necessary to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of HIV vaccines. In this HIVRAD, we will use molecules that target mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and CD40 pathways as novel adjuvants to elicit high levels of polyfunctional virus-specific CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells that are resistant to HIV infection and high avidity protective antibody that will lead to enhanced control of HIV infection. This PPG has two projects and two cores. Our project 1 will test the potential of CD40L expressed on the surface of virus-like particles as an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA SIV vaccine. Our project 2 will test the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR) as an adjuvant for DNA/MVA SIV vaccine. In addition, we will test for the effects of rapamycin on other replication defective and replication competent viral vectors. Finally, we will test the synergy between inhibiting mTOR and activating CD40 pathways for enhancing the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA SIV vaccines. The macaque studies that will be conducted in projects 1 and 2 will be supported by a non-human primate core. An administrative core will provide coordination between projects 1 and 2, and core B, and help with data management and data analyses.  RELEVANCE: WHO estimates that there are currently 32 million humans living with HIV/AIDS. Drugs and improved treatment regimens have successfully prolonged the lives of infected individuals in first world countries. However, these are not affordable for the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals. Even in developed nations these are limited by toxicity, affordability, the need for rigorous adherence to therapy and the emergence of drug resistant viruses. Thus, there is a great need to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine that provides a low-cost, low toxicity solution to long-term control of viral replication - the main goal of this PPG.  PROJECT 1: Title: CD40L-Adjuvanted Vaccines for HIV/AIDS Project Leader: AMARA, R  PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The failure of Ad5 based HIV-1 vaccine in humans that is designed to elicit primarily antiviral T cells strongly suggests the need to develop novel vaccine approaches that generate high levels of anti-viral T cells with improved function as well as protective Ab. The goal of this project is to adjuvant the cellular and humoral immunity elicited by our DNA/MVA vaccine that has just entered phase II testing in humans in US. Specifically, we propose to target the CD40 pathway on dendritic cells (DC) and B cells using CD40L. Stimulation of CD40 on DC results in production of IFNa and IL-12 that are critical for generation of highly functional antiviral CD8 response. Activation of B cells through CD40 is necessary for germinal center formation where affinity maturation of B cells occurs leading to generation of high avidity Ab. Here, we will express CD40L on the surface of a SIV virus-like particle (CD40L-VLP). These CD40L-VLPs are potent activators of DC and B cells in vitro. In addition, they can be targeted to DC (through interaction between gpl20 on VLP and CD4 on DC) and allow presentation of Env in its native form that is critical for eliciting broadly cross-reactive neutralizing Ab. In specific aim 1, we will test the potential of CD40L-adjuvanted DNA/MVA SIV vaccine to enhance control of a pathogenic SIV challenge. In addition, we will test whether delivering DNA by electroporation enhances the immunogenicity of the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted DN/VMVA vaccines. Recent studies from Dr. Rafi Ahmed's lab (PI of project 2) demonstrated that mTOR regulates memory T cell development and inhibition of this pathway following infection or vaccination using rapamycin enhances the magnitude and functional quality of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Rapamycin has also been shown to down regulate expression of CCR5 on CD4 T cells that results in marked reduction of HIV replication. This could be an added advantage for HIV vaccines, because the vaccine-elicited CCR5' virus-specific CD4 T cells may not be infected by the virus. Essentially we may be reducing the frequency of potential virus target cells while preserving the much-needed CD4 T cell help following infection. In specific aim 2, we will test the synergy between inhibiting mTOR and activating CD40 pathways for adjuvanting the immunogenicity and efficacy of DNA/MVA vaccines.  RELEVANCE: WHO estimates that there are currently 32 million humans living with HIV/AIDS.

The High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project is developing modules for middle school and high school students in Earth and Space Science classes, testing the hypothesis that students who use computational models, analyze real-world data, and engage in building scientific reasoning and argumentation skills are better able to understand Earth science core ideas and how humans impact Earth's systems. The Concord Consortium in partnership with the University of California Santa Cruz and the National Geographic Society are co-developing these modules, conducting targeted research on how the modules enhance students' higher order thinking skills and understanding of human-Earth interactions, and broadly disseminating these materials via far-reaching education networks.The High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project is creating online, middle and high school curriculum modules that feature computational models and cover five topics: climate change, fresh water availability, fossil fuel utilization, resource sustainability, and land use management. At the same time, the project team is conducting design studies to look at how specific features, prompts, argumentation and evaluation tools built into the modules affect student understanding of core Earth science concepts. The design studies promote rapid, iterative module development and help to identify features that support student learning, as well as scientific reasoning, scientific argumentation with uncertainty, systems thinking, and model-based experimentation skills. For each module, pre- and posttest data, embedded assessments, student surveys, classroom observations, teacher interviews and surveys, provide important information to rapidly improve module features, content, and usability. The final, high-quality, project materials are being made available to a national audience through the National Geographic Society as well as through the High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability website hosted at the Concord Consortium. It is essential that students graduate from high school with a solid understanding of the scientific concepts that help explain how humans impact Earth systems, and conversely, how Earth processes impact humans. The High-Adventure Science: Earth Systems and Sustainability project provides a unique, research-based approach to conveying to students core Earth science content, crosscutting concepts, and fundamental practices of science. The resulting online curriculum modules and teacher guides provide exciting examples of next generation Earth science teaching and learning materials, and the research findings provide new insights on how students learn core science concepts and gain critical scientific skills.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prognosis for survival in patients with metastatic melanoma has not changed in the last 20 years and remains dismal despite advances in tumor detection and the development of melanoma-specific systemic therapies. Because of the failure of current chemotherapeutic and immunologically- based treatments to eradicate melanoma, we propose a new approach. In this proposal, we test a replication-competent oncolytic virus generated in this lab at Yale, VSVrp30. In preliminary tests VSVrp30 shows considerable promise in the potential treatment of melanoma. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the virus selectively and rapidly infects and destroys human metastatic melanoma, with relatively little or no infection of normal human melanocytes. We seek funding to pursue experiments to determine if the virus can target and destroy melanoma cells in multiple conditions in animal and in vitro models. We will first test the oncolytic actions of the virus with a series of in vitro experiments on a large number of human melanomas and normal melanocytes available at Yale. Another set of experiments will employ human melanoma that is stably transfected with a coral reporter gene that generates a red fluorescence in the cancer cells. These human cells will be transplanted into SCID mice, both as a solid tumor, and as dispersed metastatic-like cancer cells. Virus will be given intratumorally and intravenously to test the hypothesis that the virus wll target and kill the red tumor cells with minimal infection of normal cells. Infected cells can be readily detected by the expression of a GFP reporter incorporated into the viral genome. A third set of parallel experiments will be done using the mouse melanoma line B16 in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice with a normal immune system, allowing us to test the hypothesis that the virus can selectively detect and destroy melanoma in the presence of a normal immune system, and prolong mouse survival from melanoma; if the virus does not completely eliminate the melanoma cells, we will test the secondary hypothesis that temporarily depressing the systemic or innate immune systems with immunosuppressant drugs will enhance the oncolytic actions of the virus. A fourth set of experiments will examine the genetic mechanisms underlying the increased viral infection of melanoma cells, using an extensive series of human melanomas in which the exomes have been sequenced. These experiments will be complemented by experiments to test the hypothesis that specific induced gene mutations involving BRAF, PTEN, and CDKN2A that are common to melanoma, directly increase virus infection. A final series of experiments will test the hypothesis that the virus can cross the blood brain barrier and selectively destroy melanoma in the mouse brain, and that pre-immunization, potentially followed by transient immunosuppression, will enhance oncolysis and provide another layer of protection to the brain. If we detect collateral damage to normal brain, then we will test a new virus, 1,2-VSV, that we recently generated which is the most attenuated of any VSV we have worked with, yet still targets melanoma. Its highly attenuated nature reduces concerns relating to infection of normal brain tissue. If these experiments are successful, they will form a major advance toward clinical trials for metastatic melanoma in humans.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Melanoma that has spread beyond the skin generally results in death of the patient in less than one year from diagnosis. There is currently no successful treatment. In the series of proposed experiments, we test a promising virus, VSVrp30, to determine if it can successfully target and kill human melanoma cells without causing problematic infections of normal cells, using in vitro and in vivo experiments. We include a number of alternate experimental paradigms to determine how to enhance the oncolytic efficacy of this virus against melanoma.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a highly cytolytic RNA virus that produces persistent central nervous system (CNS) infection and immune-mediated demyelination in susceptible strains of mice. TMEV infection provides a relevant experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis. In contrast to persistence of non-cytolytic RNA viruses in which the host cell survives, persistence of lytic RNA viruses in which an infected cell dies requires continuous cell- to-cell spread in order to maintain the infection. In this circumstance, the target cell in which the virus persists ideally should be renewable. The infection should not be highly productive; however, virus-specific host immune responses may control a more productive infection anyway. Macrophages are the principal virus reservoir and provide an in vitro model for TMEV persistence in the mouse CNS. TMEV infected macrophages undergo apoptosis and restrict virus production (<10 pfu/cell), in contrast to infection in other rodent cells, including neurons and oligodendrocytes, where necrotic cell death is associated with high virus yields (200-500 pfu/cell). TMEV infection is required to induce apoptosis in murine macrophages since UV- inactivated virus adsorbed to the cell surface to initiate infection does not induce apoptosis. We have shown that TMEV infection induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway that is Bax- mediated and severely restricts infectious virus production in murine macrophages. Our working hypothesis is that TMEV-induced apoptosis is a host cell-specific mechanism providing a means of spreading virus to uninfected macrophages that phagocytose apoptotic remnants containing infectious virus. To understand how TMEV infection triggers apoptosis in murine macrophages and restricts infectious virus production, four specific aims are proposed: 1) finish the identification of upstream signals (apical to the mitochondrion) involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway during TMEV virus infection in M1-D macrophages and determine potential differences in apoptosis in primary macrophages from resistant and susceptible strains of mice; 2) inhibit apoptosis in infected mice to assess the effect on TMEV CNS persistence, virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses and demyelinating disease, and examine the effect in transgenic mice deficient in p53 and Noxa on CNS persistence and demyelinating disease; 3) identify potential virus  triggers  of apoptosis by expressing TMEV nonstructural proteins L and 3CD in mammalian cells, and determine whether TMEV replicons in which the capsid proteins are deleted can induce apoptosis; and 4) investigate the mechanism of loss of infectious virus in murine macrophages that is associated with onset of apoptosis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The notion that multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease is widely accepted as fact. While MS is undoubtedly immune-mediated, an autoimmune mechanism remains unproven. Circumstantial evidence points to a persistent virus infection in MS. Moreover, immune- mediated damage can result from a virus infection in which the host immune response is directed to virus proteins rather than self proteins (autoimmunity). Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) produces a persistent central nervous system infection and immune-mediated demyelination in susceptible strains of mice, providing a relevant experimental animal model for MS. TMEV persistence is needed to drive the demyelinating disease process, but just how this virus that rapidly kills infected cells is able to perpetuate the infection is not known. This proposal addresses a mechanism of TMEV persistence, programmed cell death also termed apoptosis, which decreases virus production (may be required for persistence of virulent virus) and also fosters cell-to-cell virus spread (required for persistence in the presence of host immunity).\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents an important cause of neurological damage in children and is the leading cause of non-familial hearing loss in the US. Little is understood about the pathogenesis of this infection because suitable models of central nervous system (CNS) infection are lacking. We have developed a murine model of congenital HCMV infection which recapitulates many of the histopathological and neurodevelopmental abnormalities described in congenital HCMV infections, including hearing loss in surviving mice. In contrast to earlier models, newborn mice injected peripherally with murine CMV develop viremia and subsequently, encephalitis. Because newborn mice are neurodevelopmentally and immunologically equivalent to late 2nd trimester human fetuses, this model has also enabled us to study resolution of this virus infection in a developing animal. In this proposal we will study aspects of the CNS infection in these animals including mechanisms of neuroinvasion, the contribution of innate immune responses in clearance of the virus from the CNS, and the interplay between innate immunity and adaptive immune responses in clearance of virus from the CNS. Lastly, the contribution of both innate and adaptive immunity in persistent CNS infection in adult mice infected as newborns will be studied. We anticipate that parameters of the pathogenesis of CMV infection in the developing CNS will be identified from these studies. Furthermore, we believe that these findings can be translated directly into more focused studies in humans that could lead to new approaches for prevention and treatment of this important infection.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human cytomegalovirus infection in the developing fetus is a major cause of brain disease in infants and children. Currently no vaccines or treatment exist for this infection that is transmitted from the mother to the fetus. This project will utilize a highly related mouse virus and a mouse model of this disease to understand the characteristics of this infection that result in brain infection and the immune responses that limit virus growth and damage to the developing brain.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad species tropisms and the ability to cause fatal disease in both animals and humans have distinguished the Henipaviruses; Nipah virus and Hendra virus from all other paramyxoviruses. They can be amplified and cause disease in animals and be transmitted to humans where infection presents as a severe respiratory illness and/or febrile encephalitis. Hendra appeared in Australia in 1994 and was transmitted to humans from infected horses; Nipah appeared in1998 in Malaysia and was passed from infected pigs to humans, but several animal species were also infected. Since their initial discovery, five additional Hendra spill-over events have been reported from 1995 to 2007 and Nipah outbreaks have occurred on a regular basis in Bangladesh and India. We have been extensively studying Hendra and Nipah for several years and have characterized the envelope glycoproteins (F and G), developed animal models of virus infection and pathogenesis. We have identified the cellular receptor for both viruses (ephrinB2), developed a soluble G (sG) subunit vaccine and the first and only potent neutralizing and cross-reactive, fully-human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Most recently, we have conducted a series of preliminary virus challenge experiments in nonhuman primates (NHPs). There are presently no approved active or passive therapeutic modalities for Nipah or Hendra infection and there is a critical need for a NHP model for Nipah and Hendra infection. This proposal will bring together the expertise to fully develop and evaluate an African Green Monkey model and test several pre- and post-exposure therapeutic modalities for Nipah virus infection. The main objectives of this proposal will be to: fully characterize a NHP model of Nipah virus infection and evaluate several existing and develop new potential therapeutics for Nipah and Hendra virus infection. Specifically, we will: 1. Establish virus infection, lethal dose, and detection parameters of Nipah and Hendra virus in a nonhuman primate model. 2. Evaluate the protective efficacy of recombinant sG and sF as subunit vaccines for Nipah and Hendra virus in the AGM. 3. Determine the passive protective efficacy of a neutralizing, anti-G, fully-human mAb therapy for Nipah and Hendra virus infection in the AGM. 4. Determine the passive protective efficacy of fusion inhibitor peptide and small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy for Nipah and Hendra virus infection in the AGM. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Nipah and Hendra are NIAID Priority Pathogens and classified as BSL4 select agents and possess several characteristics which make them highly adaptable for their use as a deliberate release for malicious intent. Recent Nipah outbreaks have involved significant numbers of humans with high fatality >75% and documented person-to-person transmission. The development of therapeutics and vaccine strategies is now important.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Upwards of 33-50% of cancer patients who smoked prior to diagnosis continue to smoke following diagnosis and treatment. Continued smoking by cancer patients reduces survival time, medical treatment efficacy, and quality of life (QOL). To date, studies of smoking cessation interventions for cancer patients have failed to yield significant treatment effects. As such, currently, there is no evidence-based treatment model for addressing tobacco use in this population. With medical advances in cancer care yielding a growing constituency of cancer survivors - close to 12 million today - addressing nicotine dependence in this population is a priority. A recent NCI meeting called for the evaluation of novel treatments for nicotine dependence among cancer patients which address the unique barriers to cessation evident in this population, including: a high level of nicotine dependence, high levels of psychological distress and cognitive impairment, and a protracted relapse timeline. While PHS guidelines recommend acute treatment durations with approved medications for tobacco use, we have shown that extending the duration of treatment beyond the standard treatment duration significantly increases quit rates, reduces the risk for a relapse, and promotes recovery to abstinence following a lapse. Extended duration treatment is particularly efficacious for smokers with high levels of nicotine dependence and cognitive impairment, vs. standard duration treatment, and increases quit rates for smokers with high levels of psychological distress. Varenicline, vs. other medications for smoking, may be particularly effective for cancer patients given the drug's beneficial effects on affect ad cognition. Thus, using a double-blind placebo- controlled design with 374 cancer patients we will: 1) Compare standard varenicline treatment (12-weeks active + 12-weeks placebo) to extended varenicline treatment (24-weeks active) for increasing week 24 and week 52 biochemically-confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence~ 2) Assess the effects of extended varenicline therapy on QOL, including varenicline side effects~ and 3) Assess changes in affect and cognitive impairment as mediators of extended varenicline therapy's effect on quit rates. We will also explore potential moderators of the effect of extended varenicline treatment on quit rates (e.g., tumor site and stage, time since diagnosis, treatment history, level of nicotine dependence). This study is significant by addressing a population with high smoking rates, which has been under-studied in the area of nicotine dependence treatment, and is at risk for unique adverse tobacco-related health effects. This study is innovative by evaluating the efficacy of extended vs. standard duration varenicline treatment, which may more effectively address unique barriers to cessation in this population. This will also be the first study to use varenicline blood levels as a measure of adherence. There is widespread agreement that evidence-based treatment programs for nicotine dependence among cancer patients are needed. This study may help guide efforts to implement such programs and help determine the benefits of extended treatment duration for nicotine dependence more broadly.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: About 33-50% of cancer patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke after their diagnosis and continued smoking reduces survival, quality of life, and the effectiveness of their medical treatment. To date, no study has demonstrated an efficacious approach to treating smoking among cancer patients perhaps because these treatments have not adequately addressed barriers to quitting smoking unique to this population, including a high level of nicotine dependence, a high level of psychological distress and cognitive impairment, and a protracted relapse time-line. We have found that extending treatment for nicotine dependence with the nicotine patch from the standard duration to 24-weeks increases quit rates, promotes recovery from a lapse, uniquely helps to mitigate the adverse effects of nicotine dependence and cognitive impairment on attempts to quit smoking, and increases quit rates for smokers with high levels of psychological distress. Varenicline, the most effective treatment currently available for nicotine dependence, reduces negative affect and promotes cognitive function. Thus, this clinical trial will compare standard duration (12- weeks) to extended duration (24-weeks) treatment with varenicline for nicotine dependence among cancer patients. The trial results may serve to guide the development of a treatment model for cancer patients and contribute to a growing literature demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of extended duration treatments for nicotine dependence.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a prototype hepadnavirus with 400 million chronic carriers worldwide. Chronic HBV infection is a main risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), causing >50% of all HCCs. Early in infection, HBV spreads virtually throughout the entire liver, but during chronic infection, areas of apparently virus-freehepatocytes (20-90% of the entire hepatocyte population) appear regardless of the ongoing viremia. These findings were made in HBV-infected humans and chimpanzees and in woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is closely related to HBV. These observations, along with the analysis of kinetics of the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants, laid the foundation for a long-standing unresolved argument in the HBV field that in chronic infection, cell-to-cell spread of a hepadnavirus is at least very inefficient (if it occursat all), and super-infection is an unlikely event. It was proposed that chronic hepadnavirus infectioncan be maintained exclusively via division of the infected hepatocytes in the absence of the spread. Super-infection exclusion was shown for HBV-related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), and was suggested for HBV and WHV. However, the absence of the viral cell-to-cell spread and super-infection in chronic infections with either WHV or HBV has not been confirmed or dismissed. Therefore, in Aim 1, we propose to determine directly whether the cell-to-cell spread of hepadnavirus and super-infection of already infected cells occur during chronic infection, which would indicate that spread could be an essential factor for maintenance of chronic infection and thus could also be a so far unrecognized risk factor of HCC. In addition, HCCs are also frequently reported as being apparently virus-free in HBV carrier humans and WHV carrier woodchucks, suggesting that HCCs arise from altered hepatocytes that have lost the ability to support efficient hepadnavirus replication, and thus have a selective advantage for a clonal expansion since they are no longer targeted by the immune system. This has led us to Aim 2 that will determine (i) if hepadnavirus-induced HCC is still susceptible to infection with a hepadnavirus, and (ii) what controls the apparent virus-free status of HCC. We propose to use an invaluable surrogate model to study HBV infection and especially HCC development - WHV carrier woodchucks. We will super-infect WHV carriers with early HCCs with a different natural infectious WHV strain, WHVNY, which has a unique deletion and thus can be easily discriminated from the strain WHV7 used for the primary infection. We will (i) directly determine the susceptibility of normal hepatocytes and HCCs to WHVNY super-infection; and (ii) address if the immune system controls the ability of cells to get re-infected. Overall, the proposed study will greatly improve our understanding of the mechanism of chronic hepadnavirus infection in relation to HCC development. It has the potential to identify infectivity of virions and virus spred as important factors of pathogenesis and HCC risk, and may facilitate the use of entry inhibitors that bind the HBV receptor and block virus spread as new therapeutics for battling chronic HBV infection and reducing HCC risk.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our study will determine if virus spread and super-infection of hepatocytes and HCC cells take place in chronic hepadnaviral infection in vivo, which will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanism of hepadnavirus-related pathogenesis, and may facilitate use of entry inhibitors as antiviral and anti-HCC drugs.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in treatment for childhood cancer over the past five decades have resulted in a rapidly growing population of young cancer survivors, a substantial number of whom are adolescent/young adults - the age group at highest risk for sexually transmitted infection. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States today, with prevalence in young, sexually active individuals ranging from 44.8% in females to 51.2% in males. Persistent infection with oncogenic strains of HPV (e.g., types 16 and 18) is associated with the development of cancers affecting the genital tract and oropharyngeal mucosa. Immunosuppression increases persistence of HPV infection and risk of HPV-related malignancies. Systemic cancer treatment may result in immunosuppression for prolonged periods, placing cancer survivors at higher risk for HPV-related morbidity. The quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccine is indicated for prevention of HPV-related cancers and precancerous or dysplastic lesions in males and females between 9 and 26 years of age. The safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the qHPV vaccine have been demonstrated in healthy young individuals; however, vaccine uptake to date has been low in the general population and no studies to date have determined vaccine uptake in cancer survivors, or the immunogenicity or safety/tolerability of the qHPV vaccine in this vulnerable population. Thus, there is a critical need to develop evidence to inform optimal uptake and utilization of the HPV vaccine in cancer survivors. This proposal aims to (1) estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccine initiation in cancer survivors 9-26 years of age and examine the sociodemographic, behavioral, and medical determinants of non-initiation; and (2) among non-immunized survivors, evaluate the 3-dose qHPV vaccine series to determine the following: Immunogenicity following the third and final vaccine dose; clinical/host factors influencing immunogenicity; and the safety/tolerability of the qHPV vaccine. Evaluation of the antibody response persistence at 1 and 2 years post-vaccine initiation and clinical/host factors influencingresponse persistence will be explored. If rates of HPV vaccine initiation are low among cancer survivors, this study will inform development of theory-based interventions to improve vaccine uptake, and identify subgroups likely to derive the most benefit from targeted interventions. This study will also identify clinical factors associated with inadequate immunogenic response to the vaccine and the impact of humoral competence on response, providing a foundation for future development of alternative vaccination strategies in subgroups unable to mount an adequate response to the standard 3-dose series. The proposed research addresses the high priority areas of health promotion, cancer prevention, and cancer survivorship. Importantly, males - a population that has been significantly understudied in regard to HPV vaccination - will be included; and the study will be conducted across four geographically distinct institutions to assure representation from an ethnically and racially diverse cohort of cancer survivors.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Persistent infection with oncogenic strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV) is strongly associated with development of invasive HPV-related malignancies; risk for persistent HPV infection may be increased in young cancer survivors due to treatment-related immunosuppression. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is indicated for prevention of HPV-related cancers and precancerous lesions in males and females age 9-26, but vaccine uptake, immunogenicity and safety/tolerability have not been determined in cancer survivors. This proposal will comprehensively evaluate the HPV vaccine (uptake, immunogenicity, and safety/tolerability) in cancer survivors, identifying barriers/facilitators to vaccination and factors associated with inadequate immunogenic response, thus providing the needed evidence base for vaccine recommendations, and promoting primary prevention of HPV-related malignancies and their associated morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to identify underlying causes of Black-White differences in the likelihood of receiving definitive (potentially curative) therapy for prostate cancer (CaP) and treatment decision-making distress and regret. This knowledge is needed to design and implement interventions that will reduce racial gaps in CaP mortality and treatment decision-making distress and regret. Increasing the likelihood that Black men will receive definitive therapy when it is clinically appropriate is a critically important public health challenge. Black men are more than twice as likely to die from CaP as White men, with much of this difference attributable to Black-White differences in the receipt of definitive treatment. Recent evidence indicates that Black men are more likely to experience treatment decision-making difficulty and post-treatment decision regret. Both may stem from a common set of determinants that result in the breakdown of the treatment decision-making process for some Black men. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that racial dynamics in the health care system result in Black men being less likely to receive definitive treatment, and more likely to experience decision-making difficulty, distress, and treatment decision regret. To test the central hypothesis we will execute three Specific Aims: 1) Identify race-related variability in the factors that influence CaP treatment decision-making; 2) assess Black-White differences in CaP treatment decision-making distress, and identify determinants of these differences; and 3) assess Black-White differences in CaP post-treatment decision regret, and identify determinants of these differences. Over the course of three years, approximately 589 non-Hispanic Black (28% of sample) and 1517 non-Hispanic White men diagnosed with clinically localized CaP will be accrued in the study. They will be recruited from four major medical centers. After participants have decided how to treat their cancer, but before they have received treatment, participants will complete a self-administered mail-in paper-and-pencil survey that will inquire into their treatment choice and treatment decision-making process. At their 6-week, 1-year and 2-year post-treatment clinic visits they will also complete questionnaires inquiring into their quality of life and post-treatment decision regret. Little is known about factors that could lead to a breakdown in the CaP treatment decision-making process for Black men. The proposed study will be the first to test whether racial dynamics shown to be common in other health care domains (e.g., Black-White differences in the likelihood of having experienced racial discrimination in health care settings, physician distrust, and racial differences in patient involvement in treatment decision-making, and satisfaction with health care) contribute to Black-White differences in receipt of definitive therapy and treatment decision-making distress and regret.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Not only do Black men suffer higher mortality from prostate cancer than White men, they are less likely to receive curative therapy and they may be more likely to experience treatment decision-making distress and regret. The proposed research will test whether these differences emerge from a pattern of racial dynamics (e.g., past experiences of discrimination, low trust in physicians, and less involvement in treatment-decisions) that have been shown to be widespread among Blacks and to impair medical care. Identifying why Black men are disproportionately less likely to receive clinically appropriate prostate cancer care and experience more decision-making difficulty and regret will provide a necessary understanding for developing and implementing interventions that will ultimately reduce racial differences in prostate cancer mortality and prostate cancer- associated distress.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With rising rates of opioid addiction, inadequate opioid addiction treatment is increasingly problematic. Buprenorphine treatment can address this problem by reducing opioid use and HIV risk behaviors. Marginalized populations at high risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, like injection drug users (IDUs), have limited access to buprenorphine treatment. Because of minimal regulations, buprenorphine treatment can be integrated into community-based settings where IDUs congregate. There is great potential for strategies that emphasize community-based buprenorphine treatment to reach marginalized populations, like IDUs. Building on our previous work in which we developed community-based strategies to improve access to HIV treatment and developed a buprenorphine induction strategy to overcome induction challenges, we believe that developing a buprenorphine treatment intervention in community-based settings is critical to improving accessible and successful opioid addiction treatment for IDUs. Thus, we propose to develop a buprenorphine treatment intervention in non-medical community-based settings to improve access to opioid addiction treatment, improve health outcomes, and reduce high-risk behaviors among IDUs. We will collaborate with two community-based organizations (CBOs) to develop, test the feasibility of, and preliminarily examine a community-based buprenorphine treatment (CBBT) intervention. We anticipate that the CBBT intervention will consist of: buprenorphine education, facilitated access to physicians, support during buprenorphine induction, and support during buprenorphine maintenance. Additionally, we anticipate that the CBBT intervention will target clients of the CBOs' syringe exchange programs, be implemented by CBOs' outreach workers, and occur in the CBOs' settings. The specific aims are: 1) To develop a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will conduct focus groups and open-ended individual interviews with two CBOs' staff and clients to guide development of CBBT intervention components, materials, and processes. 2) To test the feasibility of implementing a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will examine feasibility by: 1) monitoring outreach workers' ability to adhere to the intervention manual; 2) measuring outreach worker and client satisfaction, and 3) tracking clients who engage in the CBBT intervention. 3) To examine treatment outcomes (opioid use, HIV risk behaviors, treatment retention) of a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. We will compare change in opioid use and HIV risk behaviors before and 30 days after initiating buprenorphine treatment in clients who received the CBBT intervention with clients who did not. We will also compare 30-day treatment retention. If CBBT is feasible and can improve treatment outcomes, it could positively impact the opioid and HIV epidemics. Pilot data from this project will guide our R01 grant application, to conduct a large-scale rigorous study of the effectiveness of our CBBT intervention.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With increasing rates of opioid addiction, our innovative project will develop, test the feasibility of, and preliminarily examine treatment outcomes of a community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to improve access to opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine and improve buprenorphine treatment outcomes (reduce opioid use, reduce HIV risk behaviors, and improve retention in buprenorphine treatment). This study's findings will be used to guide a large-scale study of our community-based buprenorphine treatment intervention.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes the mosquito-borne disease yellow fever (YF), a viscerotropic disease, i.e., it targets the liver, of primates. The disease is controlled by a very efficacious live attenuated vaccine, strain 17D, which was derived from wild-type strain Asibi and has been administered to over 540 million people in the last 70 years. In the last 10 years a rare, but fatal, condition has been reported due to the vaccine, termed YF vaccine associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). This condition is associated with uncontrolled replication of the virus in primary vaccinees resulting in pansystemic infection and a disease picture very similar to wild-type YFV. Originally, YEL-AVD was reported to have an incidence of 0.3 per 100,000 vaccinees. However, in October 2007, an incidence of 9 per 100,000 was reported in Peru. This alarming rate of serious adverse events is causing regulatory authorities to re-evaluate the contraindications and use of the 17D vaccine, and a number of individuals are calling for the development of a new YF vaccine. Nonetheless, it is recognized that development of a new vaccine takes at least 15 years. Thus, there is an urgent need to undertake research on the current vaccine to understand YEL-AVD and how the current vaccine could be improved. This urgency is emphasized by the use of 17D vaccine virus to generate chimeric viruses containing the structural protein genes of one flavivirus (e.g. Japanese encephalitis) in a 17D vaccine virus backbone. Such chimeric vaccines are in phase II clinical trials. Surprisingly, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the virulence of wild-type YFV or the attenuation and immunogenicity of the live- attenuated YFV 17D vaccine. This is, in part, due to the lack of a small animal of viscerotropism. The PI has developed a new YFV infection model that readily distinguishes wild-type Asibi strain from the 17D vaccine strain. Our long-term goals are to use this model to understand the immunologic basis of viscerotropism and attenuation. Our specific aims are: i) investigate the steps in the pathogenic sequence at which attenuated 17D virus infection is blocked compared with virulent Asibi virus thereby identifying potential anomalies in the innate immune response that might be important to the development of YEL-AVD; and ii) identify YFV-encoded molecular determinants of viscerotropism present in YEL-AVD isolates by examining their viscerotropic phenotype in the new mouse model developed in this project.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The highly-lethal viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the mosquito-borne yellow fever virus (YFV) was one of the most feared diseases in Africa, Europe and the Americas until the live-attenuated 17D vaccine was developed in the 1930's. Even today, over 200,000 West Africans contract YF annually, with tens of thousands of fatalities. The attenuated 17D vaccine strain was derived by repeatedly growing a wild- type YFV isolate (strain Asibi) in cultured cells. Although 17D is considered to be one of the most effective live-attenuated virus vaccines ever developed, the immunologic mechanisms that control the attenuation and immunogenicity of this live-attenuated vaccine remain a mystery. Our long-term goal is to determine how the host is able to control the 17D infection and investigate mechanisms by which vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) occurs. To achieve this goal, Drs. Ryman and Barrett have proposed a consortium agreement in which Dr. Barrett's laboratory will provide viruses to Dr. Ryman's laboratory, where their virulence will be assessed using a newly developed model of YFV pathogenesis and disease. Our understanding of host- pathogen interactions has increased sufficiently to allow rational design of live- attenuated virus strains and the technology exists to introduce and test mutations in genetically-engineered vector systems. It is anticipated that our findings will improve the safety and efficacy of the YFV vaccine, and additionally facilitate the rational design of other live-attenuated virus vaccines, particularly against other pathogenic flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile and dengue viruses) and the closely-related alphaviruses (e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus), most of which are agents of both emerging infectious disease and bioterrorism/biowarfare.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NK cells are needed in the body to protect against malignancy and virus infection. Genetic factors in different individuals can affect how NK cells recognize and respond to target cells. However, there is still much to be learned about how genetic differences can actually influence NK cells and their role in virus immunity. This proposal is based on using several new MHC congenic and transgenic mouse strains generated in the PI's laboratory to model the effect(s) of MHC polymorphism on NK cell-mediated virus immunity. The broad long-term objective for the research project seeks to understand how MHC polymorphism imparts its effect on NK-mediated virus immunity, other immune cells and protection from disease in the given hosts. Published and preliminary data implicate multiple mechanisms. A guiding hypothesis for the proposal is that MHC polymorphism can influence membrane-bound inhibitory receptors displayed by NK cells and their capacity to recognize and respond to virus infection. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. To determine the effect of Ly49G2 expression on NK cells needed in MHC-I Dk resistance to MCMV infection. The induction and kinetics of NK cells specifically responding to MCMV infection, and the effect such responses have on DCs and virus specific T cell effector cells will be examined to ascertain the underlying molecular and cellular virus control mechanisms. Aim 2. To determine the effect of inhibitory Ly49G2 receptor expression on NK cells needed in MHC-I Dk resistance to MCMV infection. Preliminary data support a critical role for Ly49G2 in virus resistance. Molecular, cellular and biochemical strategies will be used to examine the receptor and its impact on NK cells. Aim 3. To evaluate the impact of MHC-I Dk on licensing and inhibitory receptor signaling in Ly49G2+ NK cells for highly efficient MCMV resistance, protection of spleen DCs and prompt induction of virus specific CD8+ T cell immunity. Biochemical and genetic strategies will be used to probe inhibitory receptor signaling in normal and inhibitory signaling deficient NK cells, their acquisition of potent antiviral effector activity and their involvement in MHC-I Dk- dependent virus resistance. Relevance The importance and health relevance of the research described in this proposal is related to the establishment of a new mouse model to examine natural killer (NK) cells responding to and controlling virus infection. Achievement of the specific aims in the research proposal will advance our understanding of genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms used by NK cells to provide early protection against virus infection and to help kindle or elicit virus specific adaptive immune responses needed in the eventual clearance of replicating virus. The research project therefore has the potential to unlock new targets of immune cell mediated therapy to heighten disease resistance and greater understanding of the intricate links between innate and adaptive immunity may be important for vaccine development strategies.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research proposal uses several new MHC recombinant congenic and transgenic strains of mice generated in the PI's laboratory to model and investigate how MHC polymorphism can regulate NK cell- mediated virus immunity. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1 will delineate the effect of MHC polymorphism on NK and dendritic cell contributions in virus resistance; Aim 2 will examine the effect of an inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed by NK cells needed in virus resistance; and Aim 3 will study the effect of MHC polymorphism on NK cell education of effector functions which can impact early resistance to virus infection through NK cells and consequently later virus-specific immune responses.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in Argentina with consistently below recommended success rates of 53-66%, between 1998 to 2005, compared to the WHO Stop TB program target to successfully treat 85% of the cases. There are more than 10,000 new TB cases per year in Argentina, 48% are concentrated in the province of Buenos Aires and only 37% received direct observation of treatment (DOT). It is not well understood why DOT is being applied at low rates or how DOT compares to other treatment strategies when controlling for specific patient and health care facility (HCF) factors. Studies investigating treatment success tend to evaluate treatment strategies retrospectively or prospectively with patients divided into treatment groups without controlling for individual or HCF factors that may significantly impact on treatment outcome. Because of the complexity of treatment success in a given population, this study proposes a design that will prospectively assess factors and predictors, which traditionally have been studied in cross-sectional studies. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of treatment regimens (DOT or SAT) and the impact of patient and HCF level factors on treatment outcomes defined as success (cure or completion of treatment) and default in pulmonary TB patients in high burden departments of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Design: Built upon a sequential mix-method (Qualitative/Quantitative) design, we designed a prospective study to follow up a cohort of 1100 patients with first diagnosis of pulmonary TB initiating treatment at select HCF to treatment completion. Methods: The study will be conducted in 40 HCF in Buenos Aires. Patients will be followed from initiation of treatment using TB assessment cards and a survey administered at recruitment. Treatment outcomes will be assessed at the end of the two month intense treatment phase and at treatment completion. Analysis: Data will be analyzed using multilevel regression modeling to estimate 1) the association between treatment strategy and individual patient and HCF level factors with treatment outcomes, 2) the proportion of variability of outcomes attributable to patient and HCF levels and 3) identify modifiable factors that can be applied to interventional studies to optimize resource allocations and impact policy. Significance: Treatment success hinges on a multitude of challenging, dynamic and complex factors, and, although connected, not just on DOT vs. Non-DOT. Identifying barriers to DOT implementation, evaluating risk factors at the individual patient level and system level and the effectiveness of treatment strategies will provide essential information. Results of the present study will provide information necessary to improve the organization of the programs, design feasible and context relevant interventions to achieve treatment success and optimize the effectiveness of TB control strategies in Argentina and in Latin America.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is relevant to public health departments with high tuberculosis (TB) burden, the National Tuberculosis Program of Argentina, the general public and tuberculosis programs in other countries. Understanding barriers to directly observed treatment (DOT) implementation, assessing effectiveness of the treatment strategies and identifying patient and health care facility factors to inform interventional studies are necessary steps to improve treatment success to achieve recommended rates of success.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gammaherpesviruses result in lifelong infection associated with malignancies and other chronic disease in immune deficient individuals. The human gammaherpesviruses include Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma associated virus, which are associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, peritoneal effusion lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the strict host specificity of the human gammaherpesviruses, a major challenge is to understand the host and viral factors that regulate the outcome of gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo, in both healthy and immune compromised individuals. This proposal makes extensive use of the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68, to investigate the genetic contribution of viral and host genes in shaping the outcome of infection. Through our previous work, we developed an extensive knowledge of the precise in vivo contexts in which a viral gene, the viral cyclin, promotes chronic infection. We identified seven different parameters of gammaherpesvirus infection and disease, including models of immune deficiency that are dependent on the virus encoded cyclin homolog. In this grant, we will dissect the molecular pathways used by the viral cyclin to promote infection in vivo, using recombinant viruses in which the viral cyclin has been replaced by alternate viral or cellular cyclins. We will characterize the viral cyclin activity in all cyclin dependent aspects of infection, identify the infected cell reservoir in presence and absence of the viral cyclin, and define the molecular mechanism of the viral cyclin in both persistent infection and reactivation from latency infection.These recombinant viruses reveal distinct, non-overlapping mechanisms of viral cyclin action. Moreover, since different cellular cyclins are able to substitute for distinct phases of the viral infection, comparing the biochemical properties of different cyclins in distinct contexts of infection will result in significant insights in gammaherpesvirus infection and disease. By integrating our unique in vivo insights into the viral cyclin with these recombinant viruses and our identification of the cellular target of the viral cyclin in virus reactivation, this grant wil combine biochemistry and genetics, with in vitro and in vivo models of infection to define new molecular pathways that promote gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis in the whole animal. Further, we propose to test candidate inhibitors of viral cyclins and viral cyclin dependent functions both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, our demonstration that host cyclins can facilitate virus infection and that a specific host tumor suppressor can repress virus reactivationpromises that our investigation of the virus encoded cyclins will advance the field of cancer biology beyond virus associated oncogenesis. These studies of the v-cyclin have, and will continue to yield fundamental insights into gammaherpesvirus infection and further elucidate new mechanisms by which gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis can be abrogated.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The cellular cyclins have been strongly associated with tumorigenesis since their discovery, and while they were initially considered exclusively for regulating cell proliferation, recent studies show that frequent overlap in the cell proliferation functions, yet that their roles in cell fate, development and differentiation are distinct. Our studies of the virus encoded cyclins have identified that these cyclins are required at several stages of infection and pathogenesis, and that they work by at least two different mechanisms and that one of these mechanisms functions to oppose the activity of a cellular tumor suppressor protein. The work proposed here will define the mechanism of the viral cyclins during authentic infection and disease and will identify potential interventions relevant to human inflammatory disease and malignancies, both those associated with gammaherpesvirus infection and related to cellular cyclins and tumor suppressors.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality every year. Vaccines that protect from influenza virus infection are available but they have to be re-formulated annually because their effectiveness is limited to seasonal strains. The high mutation rate of influenza virus, specifically the highly variable antigenic structure of the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) is at the core of this problem. The influenza virus vaccine is reliant on an antibody response to HA and vaccines are manufactured based on predictions of which strains are the most likely to circulate in a given season. These predictions can be inaccurate, leading to ineffective vaccines. Moreover, they do not account for the emergence of pandemic strains as exemplified by the H1N1  swine flu  outbreak in 2009. Annual vaccination campaigns are also costly and there is increasing resistance to vaccination in a significant segment of the population. A universal influenza virus vaccine that affords lifetime protection against seasonal and pandemic strains would be a solution to these problems. We propose a novel strategy to develop such a universal influenza virus vaccine. The strategy is based on the recent discovery of a broadly neutralizing epitope in the influenza HA. We plan to graft this epitope onto the surface of a virus-like particle (VLP) platform that is based on the insect virus Flock House virus (FHV). FHV VLPs allow presentation of foreign epitopes in a polyvalent manner and induce a potent antibody response. Chimeric FHV particles displaying the HA epitope will be structurally characterized by cryoEM and image reconstruction as well as binding assays using the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The particles will then be used to vaccinate mice and their antibody response will be characterized by ELISA and microneutralization assays. It is expected that immunized mice generate neutralizing antibodies and this will be confirmed by challenge studies with live virus. If successful, the proposed research could lead to a transformation in flu vaccination by eliminating the challenges currently associated with this endeavor.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application we propose to develop a new influenza virus vaccine that needs to be administered only once and then protects for a lifetime against all seasonal and pandemic strains. The strategy that we will use is based on a recent discovery that there is a region in the influenza hemagglutinin protein that does not mutate and can give rise to antibodies that neutralize many different influenza viruses. We will isolate this region of the hemagglutinin protein and graft it on a carrier particle that is known to induce a very potent immune response.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza pandemics are among the foremost international public health challenges of the 21st century. Eleven probable and three possible pandemics have occurred in the past four-hundred years. The April, 2009 outbreak of a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico City demonstrated that infection can be transmitted globally in days and cause disproportionate morbidity and mortality in young adults, pregnant women, and minorities. The 2009 (H1N1) Pandemic has been defined by its transmissibility and case- fatality proportion as a  mild  pandemic; the WHO estimates that a more severe pandemic could cause hundreds of millions of deaths, and overwhelm healthcare capacity. Even during this mild pandemic, hospitals and ICUs were operating near or at surge capacity during peaks of transmission. Public health officials have limited decision support technology to plan for or prevent healthcare utilization surge in future influenza pandemics. Despite an appropriate public health response to the ongoing pandemic, several influenza A viruses remain pandemic threats. The exact timing of the next influenza pandemic is uncertain, but there is no doubt that another one will occur. Over the past three years, I have developed skills in cost-effectiveness analysis and infectious disease modeling by designing an influenza disease transmission model to compare the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of alternative pandemic mitigation strategies. Several of my model parameters are based on assumptions or data from seasonal influenza epidemics or 20th century pandemics, and my model is limited to the spread of pandemic influenza within a city. I would like to improve the accuracy of the model parameters and expand its geographical scope in order to compare the effectiveness of healthcare utilization surge preparation strategies and to inform pandemic healthcare decision support. To do so, I need to develop additional skills in large database analysis and multivariable statistical modeling by completing coursework and projects under the guidance of an experienced, multi-disciplinary team of mentors and advisors. Combined with my existing methodological background, these skills will enable me to perform research as an independent investigator in infectious disease health policy. The 2009 (H1N1) Pandemic, occurring in an era with advanced healthcare database collection, has provided a unique opportunity for me to meet all of these objectives by: (1) Measuring influenza-related healthcare costs and utilization during a pandemic; (2) Incorporating length-of-stay results from Aim 1 into multivariate analyses to predict the temporal spread of peak influenza healthcare utilization; (3) Inputting results of Aims 1 and 2 into my pandemic influenza transmission model to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative surge preparation strategies over a range of pandemic severities; and (4) Disseminating results of Aims 1, 2, and 3 through CDC to update healthcare decision support technology.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Influenza pandemics have occurred throughout recorded history; future pandemics, potentially far more severe than the 2009 (H1N1) Pandemic, continue to be serious threats. Public health officials have limited decision support technology to plan for or prevent healthcare utilization surge in future influenza pandemics. These projects will examine the comparative effectiveness of alternative pandemic preparedness and mitigation strategies, and update decision support technologies to assist public health officials for surge preparedness and response.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Viruses induce disease in the central nervous system (CNS) by either killing or disrupting essential functions of neurons within the brain and spinal cord. We propose to use well characterized models of virus-induced CNS disease to investigate the mechanisms by which viruses cause neuronal cell death and injury to the brain and spinal cord. We will delineate the specific cell signaling pathways involved in virus-induced death and tissue injury within the CNS and evaluate these signaling pathways as therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease. Our experiments are expected to lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for virus- induced CNS disease.  Apoptosis is an established mechanism of virus-induced cell death during viral encephalitis and occurs in the brain following experimental infection with a wide variety of viruses. Apoptosis is also emerging as a mechanism of motor neuron cell death in virus-induced myelitis in humans. Inhibition of caspase 3, the executioner caspase of apoptotic cell death, results in decreased severity of virus-induced encephalitis. In specific aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that inhibition of the signaling pathways that lead to apoptotic cell death wil prevent neuronal death and provide novel targets for virus induced brain and spinal cord disease following infection with a variety of clinically relevant viruses. Reovirus infection of neonatal mice provides a well characterized model system for understanding viral pathogenesis within both the brain and spinal cord. We have already identified that the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and JNK signaling are activated in the brain following reovirus infection and contribute to reovirus-induced neuronal apoptosis. We propose to identify whether these pathways are also activated: (i) in our recently developed model of reovirus-induced myelitis: (ii)in the brains of mice infected with West Nile Virus (WNV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV): (iii) following virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV) infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and: (iv) in human tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease, and to characterize their role in viral pathogenesis.  Virus infection of the CNS results in activation of innate immune responses, including the up-regulation of interferon (IFN) and increased expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISG). ISG influence apoptosis, although the mechanism by which this occurs and the role of these genes in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. In specific aim 2 we will investigate the role of specific ISG, with putative apoptotic functions, in virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV)-induced pathogenesis within the mouse brain and spinal cord, following viral infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and in tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease.  Gliosis (activation of microglia and astrocytes) is a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Gliosis has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo following infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and inflammatory mediators associated with gliosis have been detected in the brain during viral encephalitis. However, the role of gliosis in acute virus-induced CNS disease remains incompletely understood, particularly within the spinal cord. Although gliosis may play a role in inhibiting virl replication by facilitating the removal of infected cells it has been proposed that this protectiverole may be overshadowed by the release of several factors from activated glia that induce neurodegeneration and severe injury to bystander cells. In specific aim 3 we hypothesize that gliosis contributes to pathogenesis following viral infections of the CNS. We will test this hypothesis by investigating the role gliosis in virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV)-induced pathogenesis within the mouse brain and spinal cord, following viral infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and in tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain (encephalitis) and spinal cord (myelitis) induce significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. This grant proposes experiments designed to: (1) identify mechanisms of virus-induced neuronal injury in the brain and spinal cord and: (2) evaluate novel therapeutic strategies for virus-induced CNS disease. The mechanisms by which viruses kill neurons within the CNS, is likely of critical pathogenetic importance to many neurodegenerative and acquired diseases (e.g. ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury) of major importance to veterans' health. This is a basic science grant with translational components that we strongly believe have direct relevance to both important current public health problems (e.g. WNV), and a basic science theme (neuronal cell death and its prevention) that is of significant general relevance to a wide variety of neurological diseases affecting veterans.\",\n",
       " \"With the advancement in information and communication technology (ICT), traditional agriculture is transforming to modern and intelligent agriculture. Agricultural engineers equipped with ICT knowledge are highly demanded by today's high-efficiency-high-producing agricultural industry. It is critical to offer agricultural ICT training to ensure that students at Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) are adequately prepared for the agricultural industry job market. Thus PDs propose to enhance teaching capabilities by providing PVAMU students an intelligent equipment lab, improving students' learning environment, and developing a healthy teaching community through the collaboration within faculty members from several departments. The project requires expertise from several key areas within PVAMU: Agriculture Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, and Engineering Technology.

       " 'The epidemiological success of pandemic and epidemic influenza A viruses relies on the ability to transmit efficiently from person-to-person via respiratory droplets.  Respiratory droplet transmission of influenza viruses requires efficient replication and release of infectious influenza particles into the air. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus originated by reassortment of a North American triple reassortant swine (TRS) virus with a Eurasian swine virus that contributed the neuraminidase (NA) and M gene segments.  Both these precursor (TRS and Eurasian) swine viruses caused sporadic infections in humans, but failed to spread from person-to-person, unlike the pH1N1 virus.  We evaluated the pH1N1 and its precursor viruses in the ferret model to determine the contribution of different viral gene segments on the release of influenza virus particles into the air and on the transmissibility of the pH1N1 virus.  We found that the Eurasian-origin NA and M gene segments contributed to efficient respiratory droplet transmission of the pH1N1 virus likely by modulating the release of influenza particles.  All viruses replicated well in the upper respiratory tract of infected ferrets, suggesting that factors other than viral replication are important for the release of influenza virus particles and transmission. Our studies demonstrated that the release of influenza particles into the air correlated with increased NA activity. Additionally, the pleomorphic phenotype of the pH1N1 virus was dependent upon the Eurasian-origin gene segments, suggesting a link between transmission and virus morphology.  We demonstrated that the viruses are released into exhaled air to varying degrees and a constellation of genes influences the transmissibility of the pH1N1 virus. Compared to seasonal influenza viruses, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus caused greater morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. People over 60 years of age showed a higher prevalence of cross-reactive pH1N1 antibodies suggesting that they were previously exposed to an influenza virus or vaccine that was antigenically related to the pH1N1 virus. To define the basis for this cross-reactivity, we infected ferrets with H1N1 viruses of variable antigenic distance that circulated during different decades from the 1930s (Alaska/35), 1940s (Fort Monmouth/47), 1950s (Fort Warren/50), and 1990s (New Caledonia/99) and challenged them with 2009 pH1N1 virus six weeks later. Ferrets primed with the homologous CA/09 or New Jersey/76 (NJ/76) virus served as a positive control, while the negative control was an influenza B virus that should not cross-protect against influenza A virus infection. Significant protection against challenge virus replication in the respiratory tract was observed in ferrets primed with AK/35, FM/47, and NJ/76; FW/50-primed ferrets showed reduced protection, and NC/99-primed ferrets were not protected. The HAs of AK/35, FM/47, and FW/50 differ in the presence of glycosylation sites. We found that the loss of protective efficacy observed with FW/50 was associated with the presence of a specific glycosylation site. Our results suggest that changes in the HA occurred between 1947 and 1950, such that prior infection could no longer protect against 2009 pH1N1 infection. This provides a mechanistic understanding of the nature of serological cross-protection observed in people over 60 years of age during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. \\tScientists from Emory University isolated a human monoclonal antibody (hMAb, EM4C04), highly specific for the 2009 pH1N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA), from a severely ill 2009 pH1N1 virus-infected patient. We postulated that under immune pressure with EM4C04, the 2009 pH1N1 virus would undergo antigenic drift and mutate at sites that would identify the antibody binding site. To test this hypothesis, we infected MDCK cells in the presence of EM4C04 and generated 11 escape mutants, displaying 7 distinct amino acid substitutions in the HA. Six substitutions greatly reduced mAb binding (K123N, D131E, K133T, G134S, K157N, G158E). Residues 131, 133 and 134 are contiguous with 157 and 158 in the globular domain structure contribute to a novel pH1N1 antibody epitope. One mutation near the receptor binding site, S186P, increased binding affinity of the HA to the receptor. 186P and 131E are present in the highly virulent 1918 HA and were recently identified as virulence determinants in a mouse-passaged pH1N1 virus. We found that pH1N1 escape variants expressing these substitutions enhanced replication and lethality in mice compared to wild-type 2009 pH1N1 virus. Increased virulence of these viruses was associated with an increased affinity for &#945;2,3 sialic acid receptors. Our study demonstrated that antibody pressure by a hMAb targeting a novel epitope in the Sa region of 2009 pH1N1 HA could inadvertently drive the development of a more virulent virus with altered receptor binding properties. These findings broaden our understanding of antigenic drift.There are several potential strategies for the development of vaccines to protect humans against influenza viruses, including formalin inactivated whole or split virus, HA subunit, and live attenuated virus vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have several attributes related to safety, immunogenicity, cross-protection against antigenic drift strains, high yield and needle-free administration that make them attractive candidates for control of pandemic influenza. Live attenuated vaccines generally induce broadly cross-reactive protection, which may be a useful feature in the event of a pandemic if a vaccine generated from the actual pandemic strain is not available. LID scientists collaborated with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to evaluate candidate vaccines against pandemic influenza viruses, including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. The vaccine virus generated by MedImmune contains the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus and the attenuating genes from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 cold adapted (A/AA/6/60 ca) donor virus. We had previously evaluated the efficacy and immunogenicity of a live attenuated cold adapted (ca) reassortant vaccine, A/California/7/2009 (CA09ca), in mice and ferrets. Although small animal models such as mice and ferrets are often used to study the pathogenesis of influenza viruses, these animals do not fully mirror the response to live attenuated influenza vaccines in humans. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the live attenuated CA09ca pH1N1 vaccine in non-human primates. We found that replication of the CA09wt virus was different in two species of non-human primates; rhesus macaques supported replication of CA09wt and CA09ca viruses better than African green monkeys. In both species, the CA09wt virus replicated in the upper and lower respiratory tract, whereas replication of the CA09ca vaccine strain was severely restricted in the lower respiratory tract. We studied the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the CA09ca virus in rhesus macaques, and found that vaccination with either 1 or 2 doses of vaccine elicited a protective antibody titer and conferred protection against challenge with the CA09wt virus.',\n",
       " '(I) Disease Models and Pathogenesis Goal: Define animal models for arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, filoviruses and henipaviruses Arenaviruses: The virulence of a new Lassa strain from Mali was assessed in cynomolgus macaques in comparison with well-studied isolates from Sierra Leona and Liberia. The Malian isolate was found to be less pathogenic most likely due to the induction of a stronger early innate immune response. (Safronetz, J Infect Dis, under review)Bunyaviruses: The Andes virus hamster model is characterized by a strong suppression of innate immune responses during the early stage of infection and massive activation of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th2 responses during the symptomatic phase suggesting that infection-derived immune modulation is important to pathogenesis. (Safronetz 2011; Safronetz 2012) We established an acute disease model for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) using mice lacking the type I interferon receptor. This model recapitulates hallmarks of human CCHF disease including coagulation abnormalities. (Zivcec, J Infect Dis: in press).  Filoviruses: The emergence of Reston ebolavirus in domestic swine in the Philippines has caused a renewed interest in its pathogenicity. We have established a mouse disease model based on STAT1-/-mice, which may allow future pathogenesis studies. We have further defined the rhesus macaque model for Zaire ebolavirus infection with focus on coagulation disorders. (de Wit 2011; Ebihara 2011)Henipaviruses: The lethal Syrian hamster model for Henipavirus infections is characterized by acute severe respiratory distress and severe neurological symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in animals challenged with a high dose, whereas animals challenged with a low dose mainly showed neurological signs of infection. The model was used for the first Nipah virus transmission studies indicating contact transmission as the most prominent route. (de Wit 2011; Rockx 2011)(II) Vaccines  Goal: To develop and characterize fast-acting vaccines against emerging infections Our main vaccine platform is based on an attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector. This years efforts on rVSV vaccines against filoviruses are summarized in a separate report. Further vaccine efforts are discussed below.   Arenavirus: We have studied the cross-protective efficacy of an rVSV-LassaGPC vaccine against challenge with different Lassa virus strains. The vaccine completely protects guinea pigs and nonhuman primates following pre-exposure immunization against challenge with different Lassa virus strains. This indicates that the development of a single cross-protective Lassa vaccine is feasible. Interestingly, the rVSV-LassaGPC does not show post-exposure efficacy against homologous challenge in the nonhuman primate model. (Safronetz, in preparation)Bunyaviruses: We have generated a new rVSV vector expressing Andes virus glycoproteins that provided complete protection in the Syrian hamster model. High titered neutralizing antibodies following a single vaccination seem to be important for protection. The vaccine was partially protective when given post-exposure. Here, a strong innate immune response seems to be the mechanism of protection. (Brown 2011)  We are currently investigating a newly designed adenovirus-based CCHF vaccine expressing the nucleoprotein or glycoproteins. Neither vaccine vector alone provided complete protection, but nearly complete protection could be achieved with a blended approach. (Zivcec, in preparation).Filoviruses:  Ebola is a serious problem for the endangered great ape population in Central Africa. To address vaccine needs for remote wildlife populations we evaluated in a proof-of-concept study the use of a disseminating cytomegalovirus vaccine vector expressing a single Ebola nucleoprotein T cell epitope. The strategy provided complete protection against lethal challenge in the Ebola mouse model.  Future studies will focus on a disseminating vaccine vector for nonhuman primates (Tsuda 2011).Henipaviruses: We demonstrated that vaccination of African green monkeys with a recombinant subunit vaccine based on the henipavirus attachment G glycoprotein affords complete protection against subsequent Nipah virus infection with no evidence of clinical disease, virus replication, or pathology observed in any challenged subjects. Success of the recombinant subunit vaccine in nonhuman primates provides crucial data in supporting its further preclinical development for potential human use. (Bossart 2012)(III) Therapeutics/AntiviralsGoal: To develop and characterize therapeutics/antivirals to counteract emerging infectious diseases.Bunyaviruses: We tested the effect of ribavirin on Andes virus replication in the established lethal Syrian hamster model. We concluded that ribavirin treatment is beneficial for postexposure prophylaxis against HPS-causing hantaviruses. (Safronetz 2011) Henipaviruses: We tested the in vivo efficacy of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the G glycoprotein of henipaviruses. This mAb has potent in vitro neutralizing activity against Nipah and Hendra viruses. Intravenous application of the antibody as late as three days post infection completely protected African green monkeys against lethal Hendra virus challenge. (Bossart 2011) (IV) Virus BiologyGoal: To identify potential targets for intervention through better understanding of virus biology Filoviruses: Cellular cysteine proteases are proposed to play an important role in Ebola virus replication. We tested Ebola virus replication in cathepsin B & L knockout mice and could demonstrate that cathepsin cleavage is not necessary for Ebola virus replication. We conclude that other proteases can substitute for cathepsins making it difficult to use proteases as antiviral targets. (Marzi PLoS NTD: in revision) We are currently studying the mechanism of Ebola virus RNA editing. Studies have identified primary and secondary structural requirements and a potential role for VP30 as a necessary factor for RNA editing. (Mehedi, in preparation) Gene expression profiling of in vitro Zaire  ebolavirus infections identified the induction of interesting pathways and defined potential targets for intervention. In addition, our studies suggest that the binding of the transmembrane glycoprotein to target cells plays an important role in the immediate cellular response. (Cilloniz 2011; Wahl-Jensen 2011)(V) Ecology and TransmissionGoal: Understanding the interaction of virus and reservoir species to prevent transmission into end host Arenaviruses: Our continuous ecological studies have further defined endemic areas for a unique Lassa virus, Soromba R, in Mali. We have started breeding Mastomys natalensis in order to generate a colony for experimental work in the natural reservoir of Lassa virus. (Sogoba, in press) Bunyaviruses: We have established an infection model for Sin nombre virus to study the immune response to infection in the natural reservoir species, the deer mouse. We have found that the deer mouse mounts a strong anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response to infection, thereby limiting pathology and allowing virus persistence. We could also demonstrate that Andes virus, carried by the long tailed pygmy rice rat, asymptomatically replicates in deer mice, is immunogenic and gets cleared by the non-reservoir host. We now have a unique system to study the processes of hantavirus adaptation to its natural reservoir in comparison to a non-reservoir host. (Prescott, submitted)  Filoviruses: We have further defined the framework for animal and human filovirus surveillance in the Republic of Congo. Facilities for basic research on site have been created and will be expanded. We have refined our long-term sampling sites for bats.',\n",
       " \"Background and Vector Design:The filoviruses Marburg virus and Ebola virus cause severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in humans and nonhuman primates. Currently there are no approved therapeutics or vaccines available despite a number of experimental approaches. Among the promising filovirus vaccines under development is a system based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) that expresses a single filovirus glycoprotein (GP) in place of the VSV glycoprotein (G). This system was developed in our group in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Geisbert (now UTMB, Galveston) and the current status of the vaccine development was recently reviewed. (Geisbert & Feldmann, Infect Dis. 2011; 204: S1075)We have developed rVSVs expressing the GP of representative strains of all species of Ebola virus Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) as well as two strains of Marburg virus Lake Victoria marburgvirus strains Musoke (LVMARV-Mus) and Angola (LVMARV-Ang). These vaccine vectors have been extensively characterized in animal models for their protective efficacy against homologous challenges (Hoenen et al. Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2012; 12: 859; Geisbert & Feldmann, Infect Dis. 2011; 204: S1075; Marzi et al., J Bioterror Biodef. 2011; S1(4): 2157; deWit et al Genome Med. 2011; 3: 5; Falzarano et al Expert Rev Vaccines. 2011; 10: 63).. One of the main concerns with all replication-competent vaccines, including the rVSV filovirus GP vectors, is their safety. To address this concern, we performed a neurovirulence study in cynomolgus macaques where the vaccines were administered intrathalamically. Our data strongly suggest that rVSV filovirus GP vaccine vectors lack the neurovirulence properties associated with the VSV wild-type parent vector and support their further development as a vaccine platform for human use. (Mire et al PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2012; 6(3): e1567)Cross-Protection Using Monovalent Vaccine Vectors:Cross-protection among the different Ebola virus species and even Marburg virus is an important consideration and has been difficult to achieve due to relatively high genetic variability among genera in particular but also among species within a single genus, and the general lack of cross-protective antibodies even among species. In this regard we have previously performed a proof-of-concept study using a single-injection protocol with a blended vaccine including rVSV-SEBOVgp, rVSV-ZEBOVgp and rVSV-LVMARVMusgp to see if a cross-protective vaccine could be developed against four human pathogenic filoviruses endemic in Central Africa. Challenge was performed four weeks after immunization with MARV-Mus, SEBOV, ZEBOV and CIEBOV resulting in protection against homologous challenges as well as a heterologous challenge (CIEBOV) indicating that cross-protective vaccines are feasible. (Geisbert et al., J Virol. 2009; 83:7296)More recently, we have performed another proof-of-concept study in which we evaluated cross-protection following immunization with a single vaccine vector (rVSV-ZEBOVGP or rVSV-CIEBOVGP) (Falzarano et al. J Infect Dis. 2011; 204 Suppl 3: S1082). A single vaccination with the rVSV-ZEBOVgp provided cross-protection (75% survival) against a subsequent heterologous BEBOV challenge, whereas vaccination with the rVSV-CIEBOVgp resulted in no protection. This demonstrates that monovalent rVSV-based vaccines may be useful against a newly emerging species; however, heterologous protection across species remains challenging and may depend on enhancing the immune responses either through booster immunizations or through the inclusion of multiple immunogens.Overall, we can conclude that single monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors can provide partial cross-protection in cases of challenge viruses that are genetically more closely related. One approach to overcome this limitation is the use of blended monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors, which provide broader cross-protection against homologous and partial protection against certain heterologous challenges. Cross-Protection Using Multivalent Vaccine Vectors:Another approach to overcome the limitations in cross-protection is the use of multivalent rVSV vaccine vectors. A proof-of-concept study was performed in Syrian hamsters using immunization with a single bivalent rVSV vector expressing the glycoproteins of ZEBOV and Andes virus (ANDV), a New World hantavirus (rVSV-ZEBOVgp/ANDVgpc). A single immunization with rVSV-ZEBOVgp/ANDVgpc conferred complete and sterile protection against lethal ZEBOV and ANDV challenge. Complete protection was achieved with an immunization as close as 3 days prior to ZEBOV challenge, and 40% of the animals were even protected when treated with rVSV-ZEBOVgp/ANDVgpc  one day postchallenge. We concluded that bivalent rVSV vectors are a feasible approach to vaccination against multiple pathogens. (Tsuda et al. J Infect Dis. 2011; 204 Suppl 3: S1090)Infection of guinea pigs with non-adapted Ebola virus wild-type strains of the different species resulted in full protection of all animals against subsequent challenge with guinea pig-adapted ZEBOV, showing that cross-species protection is possible. However, cross-protection was not achieved in guinea pigs following immunization with a monovalent rVSV expressing a single Ebola virus GP against and subsequent heterologous challenge, indicating that the Ebola virus GPs alone are not sufficient to elucidate cross-protective efficacy. New bivalent rVSV vectors were generated that express a heterologous Ebola virus GP and additional heterologous Ebola virus proteins (VP40 or NP). After applying a 2-dose immunization approach, we observed an improved cross-protection rate. Our data demonstrate that cross-protection between the EBOV species can be achieved, although EBOV-GP alone cannot induce the required immune response. (Marzi et al. J Infect Dis. 2011; 204 Suppl 3: S1066)Based on all our results described above, we are currently generating trivalent rVSV vectors expressing three different Ebola virus GPs, one as a transmembrane protein (replacing the VSV glycoprotein) and two as soluble proteins that will be secreted. Efficacy testing of the vectors will be performed in a rodent and non-human primate model. Alternatively, we will express two Ebola virus GPs and another Ebola virus protein (i.e. VP40) in a trivalent rVSV vector.\",\n",
       " 'Internal death programs play significant roles in many diseases.  Pathogenic effects can result from inefficient cell death or from inappropriate or excessive death such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during AIDS or the SAR-CoV virus during SARS. In this project, we are taking a multifaceted approach to studying molecular mechanisms of both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death programs in lymphocytes as well as other cell types. A major focus of our investigations are death-inducing cell surface receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily such as TNFR1 and CD95/Fas/APO-1.  Both receptors play an important role in stimulating both apoptotic and nonapoptotic death of cells principally in immune processes. Little is known about how these alternative death pathways are entrained to receptor signaling.  Interestingly, both receptors can have effects beside death such as the induction of transcription factors. We are trying to understand how these receptors stimulate the intracellular machinery that causes cell death in preference to other cellular outcomes. We have discovered that inhibition of caspase-8 in non-lymphoid cells can lead to another form of cell death  exhibiting particular cytoplasmic double membrane structures called autophagy.  Although initially controversial, several labs have now shown that this form of death is particularly important for the demise of tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. We have now shown that the mechanism of autophagic death program is selective degradation of catalase which leads to a marked overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage and death. Furthermore, we have focused on genes that play key roles in this process of death.       Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process from humans to yeast by which cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are catabolized but very little was known about results at the end of autophagy when cells were selecting between autophagic cell death and survival. During starvation, the protein TOR (target of rapamycin), a nutrient-responsive kinase that controls cellular metabolism, is shut off, and autophagy is activated. Double-membrane autophagosomes sequester intracellular components and then fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, which to catabolize their contents to regenerate nutrients. Ourpresent understanding of autophagy is that it terminates with cargo degradation within autolysosomes, but how autophagy is controlled by nutrients and the subsequent fate of the autolysosome were unknown. We discovered that mTOR signalling in mammalian cells is inhibited during initiation of autophagy, but reactivated during extended starvation. Reactivation of mTOR depends on the degradation of autolysosomal products and release of nutrients. mTOR activity in turn terminates autophagy and stimulates impressive proto-lysosomal tubules and vesicles that extrude from autolysosomes and ultimately mature into functional lysosomes.  This process, that we term autophagic lysosome reforation (ALR), restores the full complement of lysosomes in the cell. This evolutionarily conserved cycle in autophagy governs nutrient sensing and lysosome homeostasis during starvation.     In parallel, we are exploring how the regulation of cellular death programs may play a role in cytopathicity associated with virus infections in AIDS and SARS.  In particular, a critical effect in the onset of AIDS following infection with HIV is the death of T lymphocytes caused by the virus. We previously found that this death process was necrotic rather than apoptotic. In 2012, we carried out a study of the two major cytopathic factors in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the accessory proteins viral infectivity factor (Vif) and viral protein R (Vpr), that inhibit cell-cycle progression at the G2 phase of the cell cycle which led to cause necrotic cell death. Although Vpr-induced blockade and the associated T-cell death have been well studied, the molecular mechanism of G2 arrest by Vif remains undefined. To elucidate how Vif kills the cell by inducing G2 arrest, we infected synchronized Jurkat human T-cells and examined the effect of Vif on the activation of Cdk1 and CyclinB1, the chief cell-cycle factors for the G2 to mitosis phase transition. We found that the characteristic dephosphorylation of an inhibitory phosphate on Cdk1 did not occur in infected cells expressing Vif. In addition, the nuclear translocation of Cdk1 and CyclinB1 was impaired. Finally, Vif-induced cell cycle arrest and cytotoxicity was correlated with proviral expression of Vif. we concluded that Vif impairs mitotic progression and causes fatal cell cycle disruption by interfering with Cdk1-CyclinB1 activation.    In 2012, we also found that during autophagy, multiple lysosomes fuse with an autophagosome to form an autolysosome in which cytoplasmic components are sequestered and degraded by lysosomal hydrolases which releases the products into the cytosol via lysosomal efflux permeases. Following starvation-induced autophagy, lysosome homeostasis is restored by autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) requiring activation of the  target of rapamycin  (TOR) kinase. Spinster (Spin) encodes a putative lysosomal efflux permease similar to a sugar transporter. Spin mutants accumulate lysosomal carbohydrates and generate enlarged lysosomes in Drosophila and in human cells. We also demonstrated that spin is crucial for mTOR reactivation and lysosome reformation during prolonged starvation. Finally, we demonstrate that the sugar transporter activity of Spin is essential for ALR. These results provide a detailed molecular insight into how lysosome biogenesis proceeds during starvation and potentially during other autophagy-inducing conditions. We also conjecture that this mechanism may underlie normal lysosome biogenesis even in nutrient replete conditions.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and caused up to 18,000 deaths in the U.S. and up to 575,000 deaths globally. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Efforts to identify pre-1918 influenza virus RNA-positive autopsy material are underway. Possible fatal influenza pneumonia cases from 1907-1917 have been identified in tissue archives and are being screened for host and viral RNA by RT-PCR. A second effort underway has been to characterize the noncoding regions of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus to complete the viral genome using a novel RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-based approach.  Finally, a method has been developed allowing high-throughput deep sequencing of host, viral, and bacterial RNA from a 1918 autopsy tissue sample.  This method significantly reduces ribosomal RNA allowing sequence analysis of viral and host mRNA expression and identification of secondary bacterial infections.',\n",
       " \"Infectious diseases account for 64% (4.879 million) of the 7.6 million deaths occurring during the first 5 years of life in 2010, with the 3 leading infectious diseases causes being pneumonia (1.396 million or 18.3% of total deaths), diarrhea (801,000 or 10.5% of total deaths) , malaria (564,000 or 7.4% of total deaths) with the largest overall mortality in Africa and S.E. Asia. Rotaviruses (RVs) have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries accounting in 2008 prior to the introduction of RV vaccines for about 453,000 deaths in the under 5 yr age group, mostly in developing countries. RVs are  egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions but the consequences  are very different as described earlier. We developed an oral, live, attenuated quadrivalent RV vaccine  to protect against the 4 epidemiologically important serotypes (G1-4).The vaccine was comprised of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus RV (RRV), a G3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and 3 human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing 10 RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype G1, G2, or G4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease, the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. in Aug 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV) to Wyeth Labs. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception (IS). Following additional CDC studies, in Oct 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported this link. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Labs withdrew the vaccine. However, later analysis demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor in the link with IS. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to IS (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately. There are questions regarding the vaccine's actual attributable risk of IS, a risk estimate that has ranged widely with a consensus figure of 1 in 10,000. Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies,we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-Univ.of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study in Finland, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule, the BRV-TV and RRV-TV induced a high level of protection against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH  study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in 3 ddifferent schedules, showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition, the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at 2 months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company (which was later transferred to the non-profit International Medica Foundation (IMF). This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially but was revived when funding became available from the IMF. Thus, a quadrivalent RRV-TV vaccine (RotaShield) was produced by The IDT Biologika GmbH in Germany, and became available in 2009 for clinical trial. A placebo-controlled phase II safety and efficacy trial began with RotaShield in Ghana on Aug. 28, 2009. By the end of Nov 2009 almost 1000 infants were given the 2nd dose of RotaShield or placebo: the 1st dose within the first 29 days of life and the 2nd dose before 60 days of age with a minimum interval of 3 weeks.  The study period ended at the end of November, 2010 when the final participant reached an age within two weeks of the first birthday. In the per-protocol analysis, which included almost 900 study  individuals, the vaccine demonstrated promising efficacy against pooled G1-G4 diarrhea. It also  induced a 4-fold or greater IgA ELISA antibody response in over 50% of of a subset of vaccinees (3.4% of controls). In addition, efforts to implement our 2nd generation vaccine, the human RV-bovine RV reassortant vaccine (BRV) for the developing countries have advanced. The NIH OTT initially granted licenses to develop the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions,1 in the U.S. and 7 in developing countries (Brazil, China and India).Three of the 8 have engaged in vaccine production and in various stages of early clinical trials (one of these was suspended- contamination) and a fourth licensee is producing pre-vaccine materials. Requests for licenses have continued with the OTT granting licenses for BRV vaccine to an additional 2 laboratories in 2009 and 2 in 2010 in China with pending requests or inquiries for licenses by additional labs in China and one in India. An additional lab in Korea has expressed interest in the human-porcine reassortant RV vaccine candidate developed by Dr.Hoshino. LID serves as an unofficial reference lab for this program performing various functions (e.g. ranging from temperature stability, to sequence analysis, etc). We are proposing that the 2nd generation RV vaccine be comprised of 6 serotypes (G1-4, 8 and 9) as a universal vaccine or as a specifically designed vaccine for different areas of the world. The proposed manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its availability at low cost, which would facilitate its implementation there. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world was given an unsolicited boost, when we were notified in Oct 2006 by PATH that the Gates Foundation had approved their application with funding  ... to support the process and clinical development of the NIH bovine rotavirus vaccine through Phase 2 at two selected manufacturers; and address product development challenges relevant to all emerging manufacturers of this vaccine.  This grant has been extended through 2012, with a further extension in deliberation. In addition, in Nov 2010 PATH received a new grant from the Gates Foundation which will support a large phase 3 trial of one of our licensees in India of a pentavalent BRV vaccine. Its implementation is pending. In 2010 PATH received a grant from the Dep't for Int'l Dev (DFID), which in part is for support of a reference lab in Vellore, India for BRV vaccine candidates which will  ...provide technical support and training on immunological assays to four BRV producers\",\n",
       " \"Acute or chronic non-A, B, C, D, E hepatitis is being studied for biological, serological or molecular evidence of transmissible agents. Fulminant non-A to E hepatitis remains a diagnostic enigma and may represent one or more previously unrecognized diseases. We are attempting to discover the etiology of this disease. Evidence for the existence of an additional water-borne hepatitis virus has come from our seroepidemiologic studies in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Hepatitis E virus may be emerging as a greater public health problem than previously thought.  We are studying its epidemiology in developing and industrialized countries worldwide. Serologic evidence of infection of swine with hepatitis E virus (HEV) was obtained. A new and unique HEV strain was recovered from infected swine and characterized.  It was shown to have a worldwide distribution. Seroepidemiological studies of swine handlers and matched blood donors have shown an excess of antibody to HEV in swine handlers, suggesting that the virus may be zoonotically spread. In addition, throughout FY 2009 and 2010, we have been evaluating the significance of antibody to HEV (anti-HEV) in domestic animals that are part of the human food chain, especially cattle, sheep and goats.  Anti-HEV has been found in all of the species, although not to the extent that it is found in swine.  Rarely, swine are an important zoonotic source of hepatitis E, especially in industrialized countries, but these don't account for the high prevalence of anti-HEV in Islamic and Jewish cultures.  In collaboration with XJ Meng, we are determining the susceptibility of goats to infection with the recognized HEV strains and attempting to recover HEV-like agents from young goats that are being intensively monitored for serologic and molecular evidence of infection.  Similar serologic evidence for infection of wild rats with HEV has also been obtained and the infecting agent has been identified. To date we have successfully transmitted the agent from rats trapped in Los Angeles to laboratory rats of the same species (Rattus norvegicus). However, transmission was difficult, suggesting that the virus replicates at low titer. In 2010, using PCR primers developed for detecting a new rat HEV in Germany, we were able to recover sequence from the Los Angeles strain of rat HEV that we had transmitted to other rats previously.  The sequence was very similar to the sequence of rat HEV recovered in Germany.  We have confirmed transmission of rat HEV to other rats and we have determined both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of rat HEV in several clinical samples from infected rats, including feces, serum and liver tissue.  We have documented that both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of the virus is relatively low in these clinical materials, thus providing an explanation for difficulty in consistent transmission.  We have also confirmed by PCR that human strains of HEV were not transmissible to laboratory rats and that the rat HEV was not transmissible to rhesus monkeys, a surrogate of man.  The low virus titers detected in rats, the difficulty in transmitting the virus to rats and the inability to transmit the rat virus to a nonhuman primate species that is susceptible to infection by human and swine HEV strains leads us to conclude that the rat virus probably does not pose a threat of zoonotic infection to humans.Modern techniques of molecular biology have been used to discover new viruses in recent years. These are now being applied to sera from patients with transfusion-associated or community-acquired hepatitis in a search for new hepatitis viruses that may cause up to 2% of such hepatitis in the US and up to one-third of hepatitis in developing countries. In addition, a significant number of cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer remain undiagnosed.  In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of virus discovery, we are applying microarray technology to attempts to transmit new agents to chimpanzees, the only species other than man that is susceptible to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses. Preliminary results are promising. Similarly, approximately one half of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases have no recognized etiology.  In collaboration with the Epidemiology Section, LID, we are applying the same approaches to attempts to identify new gastroenteritis agents. In FY 2009, while evaluating the innate and adaptive immune responses of chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV), we discovered an aberrant innate immune response in two chimpanzees that had been infected with HEV from an outbreak of hepatitis E in Pakistan.  Based on extensive experience with innate and adaptive immune responses to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses in chimpanzees, we postulated that the response in these animals was to a second agent replicating in the liver.  By attempting transmission from the second innate immune response episode to new chimpanzees, we demonstrated evidence for an infection not related to hepatitis E in the original infection.  It has been associated with only minor biochemical evidence of hepatitis, but that is also true for HEV infection of chimpanzees.  We plan to determine if this putative agent produces more severe infection on serial passage and whether it can be associated with hepatitis or other liver disease, such as liver cancer.  Liver cancer is a common sequela of infection with three of the five recognized human hepatitis viruses.In 2010, we attempted to identify an etiologic agent in clinical materials from one of the chimpanzees with evidence of infection with a possible new hepatitis agent.  Clinical samples were tested on the  virus Chip  being utilized at the time under the NCI contract with SAIC.  Although, based on sequences detected, several viruses were found to be infecting the chimpanzee, none was found to be unique to the acute phase sample but not the pre-infection sample.  Subsequently, both pre-infection and acute phase plasma samples from the chimpanzee were subjected to  next-generation  deep sequencing with  454 technology.  Both sequences of known virus families (in some cases the same as those detected by the virus Chip) and unique sequences were detected.  These are currently being subjected to in-depth analysis to determine if they include one or more previously unrecognized viruses.In 2011 we have continued to refine extraction and amplification techniques for the identification of new hepatitis viruses from primate-derived clinical materials, in anticipation of additional  next-generation  sequencing experiments.  Known viruses of known titer have been used as controls to optimize procedures.In other collaborative studies, the epidemiology of emerging norovirus infections among children were studied in stored clinical samples obtained between 1975 and 1991.  Evolutionary analysis revealed that norovirus genotype GII.3 viruses evolved at a rate comparable to that of other small RNA viruses and that these viruses evolve at a relatively steady state.  Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of prevalent noroviruses is relevant to the development of effective prevention and control strategies.In 2012 we studied rat HEV strains originally discovered in Germany and found that they naturally infected rats in Los Angeles.  Attempts to infect rats with human HEV strains and to infect nonhuman primates with rat strains indicated that rat HEV is probably not a threat to humans.\",\n",
       " 'H2N2 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine: H2N2 viruses caused the 1957 influenza pandemic and circulated in humans until 1968 when they were replaced by H3N2 viruses. Although H2 viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968, this subtype is maintained in avian reservoirs worldwide. An H2 vaccine is a high priority in preparing for a pandemic because H2 viruses have a proven capability for causing disease in humans and persons born after 1968 lack H2-specific immunity. Because the currently licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine utilized in the United States bears the internal protein genes of the influenza A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus, the A/AnnArbor/6/60 (H2N2) ca virus was a logical first choice for evaluation as an H2 vaccine candidate. However, this virus with the H2 HA and N2 NA had not been evaluated in seronegative people. An IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) virus. We evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of 7log TCID50 of this vaccine administered by nasal spray 4 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adults in an inpatient isolation unit.  The participants were followed for 2 months after 1 dose of vaccine or for 4 weeks after the second dose. \\t Twenty-one participants received a first dose of the vaccine, and 18 participants received a second dose 4 weeks later. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial. The most common adverse events after vaccination were headache and musculoskeletal pain. The vaccine was restricted in replication: 5 participants (24%) had virus detectable by culture or by rRT-PCR after the first dose, and 3 participants (17%) had virus detectable by culture or by rRT-PCR after the second dose. Antibody responses to the vaccine were also restricted: 24% of participants developed an antibody response as measured by either hemagglutination-inhibition assay (10%), or ELISA for H2 HA-specific serum IgG (24%) or IgA (16%) after either one or two doses. None of the participants had a neutralizing antibody response. Following the first dose, vaccine specific IgG secreting cells as measured by ELISPOT increased from a mean of 0.5 to 2.0/million PBMCs; vaccine specific IgA secreting cells increased from 0.1 to 0.5/million PBMCs. In conclusion, the live attenuated H2N2 1960 AA ca vaccine demonstrated a safety profile consistent with seasonal trivalent LAIV but was restricted in replication and minimally immunogenic in healthy seronegative adults. H2N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H2N3 ca vaccine based on A/swine/MO/2006 (H2N3). Nineteen subjects received the first dose and 15 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H7N7 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  Based on promising preclinical data in mice and ferrets, an IND was submitted for a Phase I study to evaluate safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of an H7N7 ca vaccine based on A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7). Fifteen subjects received the first dose and 13 received two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.H7N3 cold-adapted (ca) vaccine:  We had previously evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two doses of log7.5 TCID50 of the vaccine administered by nasal spray 5 weeks apart to normal healthy seronegative adult volunteers in an inpatient isolation unit. The subjects were followed for 2 months after 1 dose of vaccine or for 4 weeks after the second dose. The live attenuated H7N3 vaccine was well-tolerated but was highly restricted in replication in healthy seronegative adults. Despite the restricted replication, the vaccine was immunogenic, with serum IgA being the most sensitive measure of immunogenicity. A study to evaluate the safety, level of replication, infectivity and immunogenicity of a single dose of the H7N3 ca vaccine was undertaken. Twenty subjects received a single dose of the vaccine. The vaccine was well-tolerated and the analysis of the data is in progress.',\n",
       " 'The Vaccine Branch of CCR has been exploring several novel approaches to an HIV vaccine, including an adenovirus-based vaccine, a DNA vaccine, and mucosal vaccination to induce T cell responses at the site of infection.  In addition, scientists in the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) in Baltimore have been exploring a recombinant human full-length single chain (rhFLSC) HIV vaccine that involves epitopes located in and around the co-receptor binding site of HIV-1 envelope protein that are exposed after binding to CD4.  These epitopes comprise some of the most conserved and functionally important residues and there is evidence that this vaccine can elicit neutralizing antibodies against diverse primary isolates of HIV.  In FY2009, a collaborative project was initiated within CCR to test several HIV vaccine strategies of Jay Berzofsky, George Pavlakis, Barbara Felber, and Marjorie Robert-Guroff in the Vaccine Branch, CCR in combination with the rhFLCS vaccine of IHV.  In particular, macaques will be vaccinated with combinations of rhFLCS vaccine combined with a recombinant adenovirus encoding rhFLCS, a rhFLSC DNA vaccine, or a mucosal HIV vaccine.  The macaques would subsequently be challenged with SIVmac251 to assess the utility of these approaches in comparison with appropriate controls.  A number of immunologic, virologic, and clinical tests will be done to assess the safety of these vaccine approaches and their ability to yield immunologic responses and provide protection against viral challenge.',\n",
       " \"The arthropod-borne viruses within the Flaviviridae family include West Nile, Japanese encephalitis (JE), St. Louis encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses, that are important human pathogens, causing outbreaks of meningoencephalitis in humans in many regions of the world with fatality rates between 10 and 50%. WN and SLE are endemic in the North America, and WN was the major cause of viral encephalitis in the USA. During the 1999-2011 outbreaks, there were at least 31,414 reported human cases of WN illness that resulted in 1263 deaths. No established specific antiviral therapy or a licensed human vaccine is available to date to treat and prevent SLE and WN diseases. Tick-borne encephalitis is a severe neurologic disease affecting thousands of people throughout Eurasia. Despite the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines in endemic areas, an increasing incidence of TBEV during the past 2 decades emphasizes the need for an alternative vaccine that will induce a more durable immunity and protection against TBEV. In an effort to develop the efficacious live attenuated vaccines against neurotropic flaviviruses, we explored several strategies, and progress toward this goal in the past year is reviewed below.In the first approach, the live attenuated TBEV or WN vaccine candidates are being developed in the Neurotropic Flaviviruses Section (NFS) of the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV or WN with a non-neuroinvasive dengue-4 flavivirus (DEN4) and introduction of attenuating mutations. The introduction of a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3' non-coding region (3'NCR) of chimeric TBEV/DEN4 or WN/DEN4 genome that contains the structural protein genes of a highly virulent TBEV or WN virus has a significant attenuating effect on neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, and neuropathogenesis in adult mice. However, in a more susceptible animal model such as newborn or immunodeficient mice, TBEV/DEN4d30 exhibited a high level of neurovirulence in the CNS of suckling mice and monkeys compared to that observed for widely used live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine virus. Further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4d30 was achieved by introducing mutations, such as amino acid substitutions in the envelope E (Lys315 > Glu) and NS5 (Asp654Arg655 >AlaAla) proteins, that reduced the virus replication in the brain of mice. In the extensive preclinical evaluation in mice, we have identified the TBEV/DEN4d30/E315/NS5654,655 virus as the most promising vaccine candidate against TBEV since it exhibited an acceptable balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. A vaccine candidate is safe, attenuated, able to provide protection against severe TBEV challenge in mice, and has a limited potential for transmission by Aedes mosquitoes and Ixodes ticks. In the future studies, it will be necessary to examine the neurovirulence of a TBEV/DEN4d30/E315/NS5654,655 seed virus in the CNS of non-human primates prior to testing it in the clinical trials in humans. A live attenuated WN vaccine (WN/DEN4d30 virus) developed in the NFS was found to be well-tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response in healthy adult volunteers in Phase I clinical trials at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. In FY2012, the additional evidence of vaccine safety for the CNS was obtained in comparative studies of neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis in four groups of rhesus monkeys following intrathalamic inoculation with the wild-type WN virus or the WN/DEN4d30, DEN4d30, or YF 17D vaccine. The clinical and virology data indicated that the WN/DEN4d30 vaccine is the most attenuated virus in the CNS compared to either comparator virus as demonstrated by a lack of virus replication in the brain and spinal cord and the absence of clinical signs of neurological disease. Preliminary histopathology data indicated that the mean scores of virus-associated pathology for the entire CNS of WN/DEN4d30- or DEN4d30-infected monkeys were similar or lower than those of YF 17D-infected monkeys. These results suggest that the WN vaccine virus is sufficiently attenuated for the CNS as compared to YF 17D vaccine and support its further large-scale clinical trials in humans, including the risk groups of elderly volunteers. In the second approach for the design of safe and effective live flavivirus vaccines, we explored the ability of the CNS-expressed cellular microRNAs to modulate the neurotropism and pathogenesis of flaviviruses. The inclusion of a single target copy for the brain tissue-expressed miRNAs into the TBEV/DEN4 genome was sufficient to prevent the development of otherwise lethal encephalitis in adult mice. However, we found that the efficacy of miRNA-mediated inhibition of virus replication in the immature CNS of suckling mice depends on the genetic stability of the miRNA-targeted virus and the virus can revert to a virulent phenotype. In FY2012, we demonstrated that multiple miRNA-targeting of flavivirus genome in the 3'NCR strongly attenuated the virus neurovirulence and pathogenesis in the developing mouse CNS. Importantly, virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression occurs exclusively through the deletion of inserted miRNA-targets and results in the loss of the viral genome sequence located between the two most distant miRNA targets. These findings offer a general strategy to control the virus escape and reversion to a virulent phenotype: a simultaneous miRNA-targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally important regions (5'NCR, ORF, and 3'NCR) could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation since a deletion of the targeted genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA-binding sites would be lethal for the virus. Currently, we are exploring the effect of the simultaneous miRNA-targeting of viral genome in the 3'NCR and between the E and NS1 genes; a set of four viruses that contained three targets for brain-expressed mir-124 and/or mir-9 miRNAs between the E and NS1 genes and three targets for mir-124 miRNA in the 3'NCR have been generated and will be tested in the CNS of newborn mice. Thus, our findings indicate that a microRNA-targeting of the viral genome for cellular miRNAs expressed in the CNS is an effective new strategy to control the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of highly virulent neurotropic flaviviruses and could provide a new basis for design of safe and effective live virus vaccines.\",\n",

The 50 active trials in 2012 are listed below: For more info: http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/protinstitute.cgi?NEI.0.html  Title: A Pilot Study to Investigate Ustekinumab (StelaraTM) for the Treatment of Active Sight-Threatening Uveitis Number: 12-EI-0168 Background: - Uveitis is an eye inflammation that can cause vision loss. It is treated with eye drops, drugs and sometimes surgery. In some people, treatment may not prevent vision loss. A type of white blood cells called T-cells often have a role in causing uveitis. In some cases of uveitis, T-cells attack the eye and cause inflammation. A drug called ustekinumab reduces inflammation from these T-cells. Researchers want to see if ustekinumab can be used to treat uveitis. Objectives: - To see if ustekinumab can be used to treat uveitis. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have active uveitis that needs treatment. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, eye exam, and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be taken. - Participants will have at least eight clinic visits during the 64-week study period. After the first visit, visits will occur at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and then every 12 weeks. - Participants will have a ustekinumab injection at the first study visit. They will have additional doses at the second and third visits, and then every 12 weeks until 1 year after the first dose (Week 52). - Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and eye exams. Other standard treatments for uveitis may be given as needed. - There will be a final study visit 3 months after the last injection.  Title: A Phase I/II Study of the NT-501 Intraocular Implant Releasing Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) in Participants with CNGB3 Achromatopsia Number: 12-EI-0167 Background: - Achromatopsia is an inherited condition that causes vision loss because cells in the retina do not work properly. It causes loss of acuity, sensitivity to light, and loss of color vision. There are no effective treatments for achromatopsia. - Four genes currently are known to cause achromatopsia. One of these, the CNGB3 gene, is the cause in about 50 percent of people. - CNTF is a natural chemical found in the body that promotes survival and function of nerve cells. CNTF has been shown to be effective in treating retinal disease in animals and can slow vision loss. - CNTF has also been studied in over 250 people with retinal disease other than achromatopsia. In these studies, a CNTF implant was placed into the eye during a simple surgery. The implant releases CNTF inside the eye, near the retina. These studies suggested that a CNTF implant might help vision in some eye diseases. Objectives: - To learn whether a CNTF implant is safe for people with CNGB3 achromatopsia. - To learn whether CNTF can improve visual acuity or color vision, and whether it may reduce sensitivity to light in people with CNGB3 achromatopsia. Eligibility: You may be able to take part in this study if you: - Are at least 18 years old. - Test positive for mutations in the CNGB3 gene and have no mutations in another achromatopsia gene. - Have 20/100 vision or worse in at least one eye. - Are not pregnant or nursing. Design: - To determine if you can take part, we will ask about your medical history and do a physical examination and an eye examination. Blood and urine samples will be taken. - This study requires 11 visits to the National Eye Institute over 3 years. - One visit will be for the implant surgery. The implant will be placed in one eye only. - Study visits will take place 1 day after implant surgery, and again 1 week later and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years and 3 years later. These visits will help us evaluate the safety and benefit of the implant on your eye. - At the 3 year visit, you can choose to keep the CNTF implant in your eye, or you can have us remove it.  Title: A Phase II Randomized Study to Compare Anti-VEGF Agents in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema (CADME) Number: 12-EI-0134 Background: - Diabetic macular edema is a common eye complication of diabetes. It causes the blood vessels in the retina at the back of the eye to leak, causing swelling. The macula is the center part of the retina that is important for seeing fine details and for tasks such as reading, driving, or sewing. Swelling of the macula leads to vision loss and possible blindness. Inflammation may play a role in diabetic macular edema. It is also possible that there is a problem with the blood vessels and the blood supply to cells of the retina. - A chemical in the body called VEGF is important in the formation of blood vessels in the body. Lowering VEGF levels may help treat diabetic macular edema by reducing abnormal leaking blood vessels in the eye. Drugs that can lower or block VEGF include ranibizumab and bevacizumab. Both drugs have been shown to help treat diabetic macular edema. Researchers want to see if one of the drugs works better than the other. Objectives: - To compare the effectiveness of ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections for diabetic macular edema. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have diabetic macular edema in at least one eye. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full eye exam will be performed. Blood and urine samples will be collected. - One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive treatment. If both eyes are affected, both eyes may be enrolled in the study and receive different drug treatments. - The main part of the study will last for 9 months. At each study visit, participants will have physical exams and eye exams. They will answer questions about their health and any side effects from the drugs. - Participants will be assigned to one of four groups. Two groups will have two series of ranibizumab and one series of bevacizumab shots. The other two groups will have two series of bevacizumab and one series of ranibizumab shots. A series is three eye injections of the same drug every 4 weeks. The injections will be given at these study visits. The series order will vary for the different groups. - After 9 months, participants will continue to have additional study visits. If the treatment seems to be successful, the study doctor may increase the time between visits. Study injections may be given as needed every 4 weeks for up to 3 years. - Participants may have laser treatments in a study eye if needed. After being in the study for 1 year, they may also have steroid injections or other treatments as directed for the macular edema.  Title: Phase II, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study for the Evaluation of Finasteride in the Treatment of Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Number: 12-EI-0119 Background: - Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a disease that causes fluid to collect under the retina. It affects the macula, which is in the center of the retina and is needed for sharp, clear vision. In many cases, CSC resolves on its own and does not need treatment. However, in some cases it does not go away or comes back after treatment. This is known as chronic CSC. - Chronic CSC may be caused by hormones called androgens. Finasteride is a drug that can alter the effects certain of androgens. Researchers want to compare finasteride with a placebo to see if it is a safe and effective treatment for chronic CSC. Objectives: - To see if finasteride is a safe and effective treatment for chronic CSC. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic CSC in one or both eyes. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full eye exam will be performed. Blood and urine samples will also be collected. - Some participants may have photodynamic therapy (PDT), the standard treatment for CSC. PDT helps to reduce the amount of fluid in the eye. Participants will need to wait for 3 months after PDT before starting the finasteride study. - Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will take finasteride; the other group will take a placebo pill. They will take these pills for 3 months. - After 3 months on the assigned pill (finasteride or placebo), all participants will have the opportunity to take finasteride for at least another 4 years and 9 months. - Participants will have regular study visits. At each visit, they will have physical exams and eye exams. They will also provide blood and urine samples.

Blood and urine samples will also be collected. - One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive injections. - Participants will have six study visits over 4 months (initial visit and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16). The injection will be given at the first visit. If the study eye responds to the treatment, participants may have injections in the other eye at the second visit. - If there is still inflammation after the first injection, or if the scleritis improves but then returns, participants may have a second injection at Week 4. - Treatment will be monitored with blood tests and eye exams. - Participants may have study visits and injections for up to 1 year if the treatment seems to be working.  Title: NEI Intramural Biorepository for Retinal Diseases Number: 12-EI-0042 Background: - To understand diseases of the retina and the eye, information is needed about people with and without such diseases. Researchers want to study these people and follow them over time. They also want to study body tissues and blood to understand the nature of eye disease. Studying genes, cells, and tissues may help them understand why some people get eye problems and others do not, or why some people respond to treatment while others do not. Researchers want to collect physical samples and personal data to develop a National Eye Institute database. Objectives: - To collect health information and blood and tissue samples from people with and without eye diseases, to be used in research studies. Eligibility: - Individuals of any age with different types of eye disease. - Healthy volunteers with no history of eye disease. Design: - Participants may be recruited from National Eye Institute studies or may be referred from other sources. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have a full eye exam. Questions will be asked about family medical history, especially about eye disease. - Blood samples will be collected.

Adult participants may also provide a skin sample. - Tissue or fluid from eye collected as part of eye care or treatment may also be added to the database. - No treatment will be provided as part of this study.  Title: Pilot Phase I/II study of the Treatment of Classic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy with Topical Interferon Gamma-1b Number: 12-EI-0013  Background: - In the eye disease central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), fluid collects under the retina at the back of the eye. CSC can resolve on its own, but in some people it lasts for several months or can come back. The fluid buildup during CSC can cause vision loss. The drug interferon gamma-1b can help reduce fluid accumulation in the retina. Researchers want to see if interferon gamma-1b can help treat and prevent vision loss from CSC. Objectives: - To see interferon gamma-1b eye drops are a safe and effective treatment for CSC. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have CSC in at least one eye. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have an eye exam and blood tests. - This study will require at least six visits to the National Institutes of Health eye clinic over 8 weeks. Each visit will last up to 4 hours. - Participants will receive the study eye drops at the initial visit. The drops must be used three or four times a day for 2 weeks. They must be stored in a cool place (like a refrigerator). - Participants will return to the eye clinic 2 days after the first visit and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after starting the study eye drops. These visits will involve blood tests and eye exams. - If the CSC does not improve after the first 2 weeks, participants will receive another 2 weeks of eye drops. This set will start 4 weeks after the initial study visit. - The study will end with the final visit, 8 weeks after the initial study visit. Title: A Pilot Study for the Evaluation of Minocycline as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Central Retinal Vein Occlusions  Number: 11-EI-0264  Background: - Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a blockage of the main vein that carries blood away from the retina in the back of the eye. It can lead to macular edema, a swelling of the retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested to see if it can treat CRVO. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for central retinal vein occlusion. Design: - This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits to the National Eye Institute. Participants must agree to protect themselves from sunlight or artificial ultraviolet rays while in this study. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive the medicine. - Participants will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years. - Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies. Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Title: A Pilot Study for the Evaluation of Minocycline as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Branched Retinal Vein Occlusions  Number: 11-EI-0263  Background: - Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina in the back of the eye. It often leads to macular edema, a swelling of the retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested to see if it can treat BRVO. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for branch retinal vein occlusion. Design: - This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits to the National Eye Institute. Participants must agree to protect themselves from sunlight or artificial ultraviolet rays while in this study. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive the medicine. - Those in the study will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years. - Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies. Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Title: Pilot Study of the Evaluation of Intravitreal Sirolimus in the Treatment of Bilateral Geographic Atrophy Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration Number: 11-EI-0249 Summary: Background: - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in older people. It affects the macula, the part of the retina needed for clear vision. An advanced form of AMD, called geographic atrophy (GA), may be partly caused by inflammation. Sirolimus is a drug that can help prevent inflammation. Researchers want to see if sirolimus can help prevent vision loss in people with GA. Objectives: - To determine if sirolimus can help prevent vision loss in people with geographic atrophy. Design: - This study requires at least 15 visits to the National Eye Institute over 2 years. Study visits will be every 2 months for 2 years. - Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, and eye exams. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive the study drug. - Participants will have a sirolimus injection into the study eye. There will be a followup exam 1 month later, with an eye exam but no injection. - Participants will have regular visits with eye exams and injections for 2 years. - Two months after the final injection, participants will have a final clinic visit with an eye exam. Title: Generation of Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cell Lines From Somatic Cells of Best Disease, Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Patients Number: 11-EI-0245 Summary: Background: - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best disease), Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) all affect the retina, the light sensing area at the back of the eye. Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases. However, cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research. Researchers want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells with those of healthy volunteers. Objectives: - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD. Design: - The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute. - Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history. They will also have an eye exam. - Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy. The hair will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the inside of the upper arm. Title: A Pilot Phase I/II Study for the Evaluation of Dextromethorphan as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema (MiDME2) Number: 11-EI-0244 Summary: Background: - Many people with diabetes have macular edema (swelling) at the back of the eye. Macular edema can cause loss of vision. Studies suggest that inflammation may be involved in the swelling. A drug called dextromethorphan may help prevent the inflammation and the swelling. Dextromethorphan is approved for use as a cough medicine, but it has not been studied to see if it can help in diabetic macular edema. Objectives: - To see if dextromethorphan can help treat diabetic macular edema. Design: - This study lasts 2 years, and will require at least 14 visits to the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic. Study visits will be every month for the first 2 months and then every other month. Each visit will take about 2 to 4 hours. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, eye exam, and blood tests. One eye with macular edema will be chosen as the study eye for testing. - Participants will take dextromethorphan twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years. A study diary will help keep track of the date, time, and number of pills taken. - Participants will have study visits once a month for the first 2 months and then every other month for the rest of the study. Each study visit will involve eye exams and blood and urine tests. - Four months after starting the study medication, participants may have laser surgery or other treatments for the macular edema, if it is needed. Title: The Natural History of Ocular Graft-Versus Host Disease Number: 11-EI-0173 Summary: Background: - Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is used to treat some kinds of cancer, blood cell disorders, and immune disorders. Stem cells from a donor's blood are used to replace the recipient's stem cells in the bone marrow. The recipient's bone marrow can then produce new blood cells. Some of these new cells involved in the immune system are like the donor's cells. Sometimes immune cells from the SCT attack the recipient's normal tissues, including the eyes. This type of immune attack is called graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD. -The symptoms of ocular GVHD include eye pain, irritation, dryness, and inflammation. When it is severe and if it does not respond well to treatment, ocular GVHD may also cause vision loss. Objective: - To learn more about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the eyes in people who have had stem cell transplantation. Design: -The study lasts for 1 year and includes six visits to the National Eye Institute. (There is an optional visit about 1 month before your SCT.) When possible, visits for this study will be scheduled so that they can be done on the same day as your visits for the NCI or NHLBI protocol that you are taking part in. -At each visit, participants will have a medical exam and an eye history will be taken. They will have an eye exam and a test to measure the ability to make tears. Those in the study will also have tear fluid collected for analysis in a lab. Tear fluid collection is a painless process. Blood will be drawn during certain visits if it has not already been collected by the transplant team. Title: The Treatment of Macular Edema Secondary to Uveitis using Topical Interferon Gamma Number: 11-EI-0167 Summary: Background: - Uveitis is a serious eye condition in which the immune system attacks the eye and can cause vision loss. A common problem related to uveitis is macular edema. This is a swelling of the central part of the retina. This part of the retina is needed for sharp, clear vision. This swelling can lead to more vision loss. - Interferon gamma-1b is a lab-created protein that acts like the material made by the white blood cells that help fight infection. It changes the way the immune system reacts to the cells in the eye and may help to lessen the swelling in the back of the eye. It has been used as an injection to treat other immune diseases, but it has not been tested as an eye drop for use in uveitis other than a safety trial done at NIH in 2010. Objectives: - To test the effectiveness of interferon gamma eye drops to treat macular edema caused by uveitis. Design: - This study requires three visits to the study clinic over about 2 weeks. Each visit will last 1 to 2 hours. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and a full eye exam. One eye will be designated as the study eye. - Participants will place eye drops in the study eye four times a day for 1 week. - At the second study visit (after 1 week), participants will have an eye exam and a physical exam, and will return the eye drops. - Participants will have a final study visit 1 week after the second visit, with a final eye exam. Title: Longitudinal Investigation of Dark Adaptation in Participants with Age-Related Macular Degeneration Number: 11-EI-0147 Summary: Background: - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals over 55 years of age. It can cause permanent loss of central vision, which is important for seeing fine details and long distances. AMD has two forms: wet AMD and dry AMD. Most people with AMD have dry AMD. But dry AMD can progress to wet AMD. Wet AMD is the more serious form and can result in severe vision loss. - A method to identify and monitor the early to middle stages of AMD may help researchers develop new treatments to stop the disease before it becomes severe. In early dry AMD, people cannot see well at night. Researchers want to study whether a procedure that measures how the eye adjusts to the dark can help to identify and monitor early to middle dry AMD. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of using a dark adaptation protocol to identify and monitor early to middle dry age-related macular degeneration. Design: - People will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, and a full eye exam. - This study will last 5 years and require at least 9 visits to NIH. (First visit; study visits at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and 3 yearly followup visits). -Up to 10 people will be asked to come back to the clinic 1 week after their first visit. They will be asked to test the device to be used in the study. - Participants will have baseline exams. These questions will be about problems that affect their eyes under different lighting conditions. - At every visit, participants will answer questions about general health and current medications (including any vitamins or supplements). They will also have a full eye exam and a 20- to 40-minute test. This test measures how fast the eyes recover in response to decreasing levels of light. The test also measures how sensitive the eyes are to these conditions. - Participants will continue to have these tests at the yearly followup examinations. They will be treated with the standard of care for any eye conditions they have or may develop during the study. Title: Home Vision Monitoring in AREDS2 for Progression to Neovascular AMD Using the Foresee Home Device Number: 11-EI-0124 Summary: Background: - In the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), new blood vessels grow and cause fluid leaks into the retina, which leads to loss of vision. Some studies suggest that if the development of new blood vessels (choroidal neovascularization, or CNV) is detected early, treatment could be started sooner, which may help prevent visual loss. One possible method of early detection is the ForeseeHome device, which is part of a program designed to allow individuals to monitor their eyes for vision changes at home. Researchers are interested in comparing eye disease progression in people using the ForeseeHome device with those not using the device. Objectives: - To determine if home monitoring of age-related macular degeneration using the ForeseeHome device can help detect progression of disease earlier than standard care. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, and eye examinations. Participants will also be introduced to the device in order to determine if they will be able to use it for the duration of the study. - Half of the study participants will receive the ForeseeHome device; the other half will have standard of care monitoring. Participants will be asked only to monitor the eye(s) that are at risk for progression to wet AMD. - Participants assigned to the device monitoring group will receive the ForeseeHome device, a personal monitor that has a head unit with a viewer and internal screen, and a modem connected to a telephone cord. This cord must be attached to a land telephone line so that it can send data to the sponsor. Set-up instructions will be included with the device. - Participants will use the ForeseeHome device daily by looking at a screen and identifying certain patterns presented on the screen. The test takes about 4 minutes for each eye at risk. Test results will be transmitted by the modem to the sponsor, and the results will be reviewed by trained personnel. If the testing suggests a change in eye condition, participants and their AREDS2 clinic site will be notified by telephone and asked to schedule an appointment for an examination within 3 days of the call. - Participants in the standard care group should continue to have regular clinic visits and the required AREDS2 study visits, and will monitor eye symptoms using the instructions provided by the eye doctor for identifying possible CNV. Participants should contact the AREDS2 clinic promptly and come to the clinic within 3 days of any changes in vision. - The ForeseeHome device will be returned (1) after progression to CNV of the eye at risk, (2) at the end of the study, or (3) if use of the device produces unreliable results such that monitoring with the device becomes unreliable. Title: Treatment of Non-infectious Panuveitis, Intermediate and Posterior Uveitis Associated Macular Edema with Intravitreal Methotrexate Number: 11-EI-0107 Summary: Background: - Uveitis comprises of a group of diseases associated with inflammation of the eye that can lead to vision loss. Some people with uveitis also have macular edema (swelling of the retina at the back of the eye). Uveitis and macular edema are treated with medications and sometimes surgery, but treatment does not always prevent vision loss. Previous research has shown that injections of methotrexate into the eye of people with eye disease other than uveitis can help relieve the inflammation, or swelling, that causes macular edema and can slow visual loss. However, it has not yet been approved as a treatment for macular edema associated with uveitis. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of methotrexate injections as a treatment for macular edema associated with uveitis. Design: - This study requires at least nine visits to the National Eye Institute study clinic over a period of 6 mo\",\n",
       " \"Foremost among the pathogens under study in this new project is the influenza virus, including the agents of conventional seasonal influenza, novel new strains of influenza A such as the H1N1 strain that emerged in April 2009, as well as the ongoing threat of avian (H5N1) virus. Novel means first to better characterize and then to treat infection with these respiratory pathogens using existing or newly developed strategies are a primary focus of this important new project within the Clinical Research Section of the LIR. The first major initiative undertaken in this project was a collaborative protocol undertaken with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) as well as the Department of Defense to determine if novel pharmacokinetic means could be used to extend the useful half-life of oseltamivir, the major licensed oral antiviral drug used to treat seasonal influenza in the United states and elsewhere and also a drug in comparatively short supply on a global scale.The pharmacokinetics of oseltamvir plus probenecid were analyzed and showed a dose-dependent favorable effect of the latter upon both the trough and area-under-the-curve concentrations of the former. At the schedule of four times daily dosing with probenecid, these parameters were not statistically different from daily dosing of oseltamivir alone, suggesting that probenecid might be useful in extending the supply of oseltamivir in a situation of limited drug supply.The ability of oseltamivir to treat effectively severe cases of seasonal influenza may be limited, and knowledge of its utility in treating human cases of avian influenza is largely anecdotal. For these reasons NIAID undertook three clinical trials focused on the therapeutics of human influenza. One is a phase II double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted within a network of research collaborators in Southeast Asia that compared the relative efficacy of high dose versus standard-dose oseltamivir for the treatment of severe influenza and avian influenza. This trial has been completed in the affected countries and data analysis is being finalized. The second was a phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to evaluate the relative safety and tolerability of a novel intravenous anti-influenza agent, peramivir, in healthy volunteer subjects. This trial was initiated at the Clinical Center but then largely completed by the sponsor through a Clinical Research Organization.  The third trial was a phase II vaccine dose-finding pilot study for the development of an anti-influenza A (H5N1) intravenous hyper-immune globulin preparation of potential utility in the treatment of human cases of avian influenza. H5N1 avian influenza represents an episodic zoonotic disease with the potential to cause a pandemic, and antiviral resistance is of considerable concern. We sought to generate high-titer H5N1 antibodies in healthy volunteers for the purpose of developing hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin. We conducted a dose-escalating, unblinded clinical trial involving 75 subjects aged 18-59 years. Three cohorts of twenty-five subjects were enrolled sequentially and received 90, 120, or 180 micrograms of H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine in 4 doses administered approximately 28 days apart. No statistically significant dose-related increases in the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody were observed when the 90-microg, 120-microg, and 180-microg cohorts were compared. However, the results did suggest that a third and fourth dose of the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine may result in higher hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization GMTs, compared with the GMTs resulting from fewer doses, even if there was no apparent benefit to increasing the dose of the vaccine.In addition to these trials, we have also undertaken a study of a novel nasally-administered agent with potential antiviral activity against avariety of respiratory viruses, including influenza. In this phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical nasal Poly-ICLC (synthetic dsRNA strands of poly-inosinic and poly-cytidylic acids), normal volunteers received escalating doses of this biologic response modifier to determine its safety when nasally administered as well as to measure both local and systemic immunologic effects of its administration. This trial is currently in the final stages of data analysis.    In response to the emergence of a pandemic strain of novel H1N1 influenza A in April 2009, our section undertook additional clinical research efforts to help better characterize and treat infection with this novel new strain. To begin with, protocol 07-I-0229 Influenza in the Immunocompromised Host was revised to allow enrollment and study of normal volunteers in addition to patients with immunodeficiency disorders. A new protocol was also developed to allow serial collection of high-titer anti-H1N1v plasma either from patients recovering from pandemic 2009 H1N1 naturally-acquired infection or from recipients of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. The goal of this protocol is to allow harvesting of a pool of high-titer antisera (in the form of either plasma or a manufactured IVIG product) that could then be tested as a potential therapeutic adjunct in the management of patients with severe or life-threatening 2009 H1N1 infection. A treatment trial involving open-label administration of two units of hyperimmune 2009 H1N1 plasma to hospitalized patients with severe influenza was then launched and is currently open to enrollment on a multicenter basis. We have also launched two randomized multicenter trials internationally evaluating 1) the virologic and clinical correlation of triple combination anti-influenza treatment versus monotherapy in at-risk populations, and 2) the use of virologic assessments in measuring the effects of oseltamivir versus placebo in mild outpatient disease. Finally, we have also continued to contribute to the management and oversight of one domestic and two large international observational protocols for outpatients or hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 or other seasonal influenza infection administered under the auspices of DMID or the INSIGHT clinical trials network, respectively. The goal of the latter two large trials is to better characterize the clinical aspects of both 2009 H1N1 and other types of seasonal influenza infection on a global basis, to define predictors of severe disease and/or death, to sequence and compare viral genomes on a geographic and epidemiologic basis, and to develop a repository of clinical research specimens potentially of great value in helping map viral antigenic drift, emerging patterns of drug resistance, and other aspects of the evolving pandemic. Most recently at the Clinical Center we have launched an open-label investigational treatment trial of parainfluenza virus infection using the novel agent DAS-181.Lastly, in addition to the clinical trials described above, we 1) continue to monitor on a yearly basis the clinical and psychologic status of a subset of patients previously exposed to anthrax as a result of the October 2001 anthrax attacks, including maintaining an open clinical protocol for the study of additional anthrax exposures that may occur through accidental or occupational exposures, and 2) have initiated a clinical research protocol to allow the hospitalization (within NIAID's Special Clinical Studies Unit), study and treatment of BSL-3/4 laboratory workers potentially exposed to select agents, or of other patients exposed to emerging infectious disease pathogens of public health importance.\",\n",

Title: A Pilot Study for the Evaluation of Minocycline as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Branched Retinal Vein Occlusions  Number: 11-EI-0263  Background: - Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina in the back of the eye. It often leads to macular edema, a swelling of the retina that is a common source of vision loss. Studies suggest that inflammation might be a cause. Minocycline is a drug that might help prevent cells involved in inflammation from becoming activated. It is approved for use as an antibiotic, but it has not yet been tested to see if it can treat BRVO. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for branch retinal vein occlusion. Design: - This study lasts 2 years, with at least 25 visits to the National Eye Institute. Participants must agree to protect themselves from sunlight or artificial ultraviolet rays while in this study. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood tests and an eye exam. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive the medicine. - Those in the study will take minocycline or a placebo pill twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years. - Participants will have monthly visits for blood tests and full eye exams to study the effect of the treatment. Other exams may include thyroid tests and eye imaging studies. Those in the study may also receive injections of a drug to prevent the growth of new blood vessels in the eye. Title: Pilot Study of the Evaluation of Intravitreal Sirolimus in the Treatment of Bilateral Geographic Atrophy Associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration Number: 11-EI-0249 Summary: Background: - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in older people. It affects the macula, the part of the retina needed for clear vision. An advanced form of AMD, called geographic atrophy (GA), may be partly caused by inflammation. Sirolimus is a drug that can help prevent inflammation. Researchers want to see if sirolimus can help prevent vision loss in people with GA. Objectives: - To determine if sirolimus can help prevent vision loss in people with geographic atrophy. Design: - This study requires at least 15 visits to the National Eye Institute over 2 years. Study visits will be every 2 months for 2 years. - Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests, and eye exams. One eye will be selected as the study eye to receive the study drug. - Participants will have a sirolimus injection into the study eye. There will be a followup exam 1 month later, with an eye exam but no injection. - Participants will have regular visits with eye exams and injections for 2 years. - Two months after the final injection, participants will have a final clinic visit with an eye exam. Title: Generation of Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cell Lines From Somatic Cells of Best Disease, Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Patients Number: 11-EI-0245 Summary: Background: - Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best disease), Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD), and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) all affect the retina, the light sensing area at the back of the eye. Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases. However, cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research. Researchers want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells with those of healthy volunteers. Objectives: - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD. Design: - The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute. - Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history. They will also have an eye exam. - Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy. The hair will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the inside of the upper arm. Title: A Pilot Phase I/II Study for the Evaluation of Dextromethorphan as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema (MiDME2) Number: 11-EI-0244 Summary: Background: - Many people with diabetes have macular edema (swelling) at the back of the eye. Macular edema can cause loss of vision. Studies suggest that inflammation may be involved in the swelling. A drug called dextromethorphan may help prevent the inflammation and the swelling. Dextromethorphan is approved for use as a cough medicine, but it has not been studied to see if it can help in diabetic macular edema. Objectives: - To see if dextromethorphan can help treat diabetic macular edema. Design: - This study lasts 2 years, and will require at least 14 visits to the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic. Study visits will be every month for the first 2 months and then every other month. Each visit will take about 2 to 4 hours. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, eye exam, and blood tests. One eye with macular edema will be chosen as the study eye for testing. - Participants will take dextromethorphan twice a day, about 12 hours apart, for 2 years. A study diary will help keep track of the date, time, and number of pills taken. - Participants will have study visits once a month for the first 2 months and then every other month for the rest of the study. Each study visit will involve eye exams and blood and urine tests. - Four months after starting the study medication, participants may have laser surgery or other treatments for the macular edema, if it is needed. Title: The Natural History of Ocular Graft-Versus Host Disease Number: 11-EI-0173 Summary: Background: - Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is used to treat some kinds of cancer, blood cell disorders, and immune disorders. Stem cells from a donor's blood are used to replace the recipient's stem cells in the bone marrow. The recipient's bone marrow can then produce new blood cells. Some of these new cells involved in the immune system are like the donor's cells. Sometimes immune cells from the SCT attack the recipient's normal tissues, including the eyes. This type of immune attack is called graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD. -The symptoms of ocular GVHD include eye pain, irritation, dryness, and inflammation. When it is severe and if it does not respond well to treatment, ocular GVHD may also cause vision loss. Objective: - To learn more about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the eyes in people who have had stem cell transplantation. Design: -The study lasts for 1 year and includes six visits to the National Eye Institute. (There is an optional visit about 1 month before your SCT.) When possible, visits for this study will be scheduled so that they can be done on the same day as your visits for the NCI or NHLBI protocol that you are taking part in. -At each visit, participants will have a medical exam and an eye history will be taken. They will have an eye exam and a test to measure the ability to make tears. Those in the study will also have tear fluid collected for analysis in a lab. Tear fluid collection is a painless process. Blood will be drawn during certain visits if it has not already been collected by the transplant team. Title: The Treatment of Macular Edema Secondary to Uveitis using Topical Interferon Gamma Number: 11-EI-0167 Summary: Background: - Uveitis is a serious eye condition in which the immune system attacks the eye and can cause vision loss. A common problem related to uveitis is macular edema. This is a swelling of the central part of the retina. This part of the retina is needed for sharp, clear vision. This swelling can lead to more vision loss. - Interferon gamma-1b is a lab-created protein that acts like the material made by the white blood cells that help fight infection. It changes the way the immune system reacts to the cells in the eye and may help to lessen the swelling in the back of the eye. It has been used as an injection to treat other immune diseases, but it has not been tested as an eye drop for use in uveitis other than a safety trial done at NIH in 2010. Objectives: - To test the effectiveness of interferon gamma eye drops to treat macular edema caused by uveitis. Design: - This study requires three visits to the study clinic over about 2 weeks. Each visit will last 1 to 2 hours. - Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and a full eye exam. One eye will be designated as the study eye. - Participants will place eye drops in the study eye four times a day for 1 week. - At the second study visit (after 1 week), participants will have an eye exam and a physical exam, and will return the eye drops. - Participants will have a final study visit 1 week after the second visit, with a final eye exam. Title: Longitudinal Investigation of Dark Adaptation in Participants with Age-Related Macular Degeneration Number: 11-EI-0147 Summary: Background: - Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals over 55 years of age. It can cause permanent loss of central vision, which is important for seeing fine details and long distances. AMD has two forms: wet AMD and dry AMD. Most people with AMD have dry AMD. But dry AMD can progress to wet AMD. Wet AMD is the more serious form and can result in severe vision loss. - A method to identify and monitor the early to middle stages of AMD may help researchers develop new treatments to stop the disease before it becomes severe. In early dry AMD, people cannot see well at night. Researchers want to study whether a procedure that measures how the eye adjusts to the dark can help to identify and monitor early to middle dry AMD. Objectives: - To evaluate the effectiveness of using a dark adaptation protocol to identify and monitor early to middle dry age-related macular degeneration. Design: - People will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, and a full eye exam. - This study will last 5 years and require at least 9 visits to NIH. (First visit; study visits at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and 3 yearly followup visits). -Up to 10 people will be asked to come back to the clinic 1 week after their first visit. They will be asked to test the device to be used in the study. - Participants will have baseline exams. These questions will be about problems that affect their eyes under different lighting conditions. - At every visit, participants will answer questions about general health and current medications (including any vitamins or supplements). They will also have a full eye exam and a 20- to 40-minute test. This test measures how fast the eyes recover in response to decreasing levels of light. The test also measures how sensitive the eyes are to these conditions. - Participants will continue to have these tests at the yearly followup examinations. They will be treated with the standard of care for any eye conditions they have or may develop during the study. Title: Home Vision Monitoring in AREDS2 for Progression to Neovascular AMD Using the Foresee Home Device Number: 11-EI-0124 Summary: Background: - In the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), new blood vessels grow and cause fluid leaks into the retina, which leads to loss of vision. Some studies suggest that if the development of new blood vessels (choroidal neovascularization, or CNV) is detected early, treatment could be started sooner, which may help prevent visual loss. One possible method of early detection is the ForeseeHome device, which is part of a program designed to allow individuals to monitor their eyes for vision changes at home. Researchers are interested in comparing eye disease progression in people using the ForeseeHome device with those not using the device. Objectives: - To determine if home monitoring of age-related macular degeneration using the ForeseeHome device can help detect progression of disease earlier than standard care. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, and eye examinations. Participants will also be introduced to the device in order to determine if they will be able to use it for the duration of the study. - Half of the study participants will receive the ForeseeHome device; the other half will have standard of care monitoring. Participants will be asked only to monitor the eye(s) that are at risk for progression to wet AMD. - Participants assigned to the device monitoring group will receive the ForeseeHome device, a personal monitor that has a head unit with a viewer and internal screen, and a modem connected to a telephone cord. This cord must be attached to a land telephone line so that it can send data to the sponsor. Set-up instructions will be included with the device. - Participants will use the ForeseeHome device daily by looking at a screen and identifying certain patterns presented on the screen. The test takes about 4 minutes for each eye at risk. Test results will be transmitted by the modem to the sponsor, and the results will be reviewed by trained personnel. If the testing suggests a change in eye condition, participants and their AREDS2 clinic site will be notified by telephone and asked to schedule an appointment for an examination within 3 days of the call. - Participants in the standard care group should continue to have regular clinic visits and the required AREDS2 study visits, and will monitor eye symptoms using the instructions provided by the eye doctor for identifying possible CNV. Participants should contact the AREDS2 clinic promptly and come to the clinic within 3 days of any changes in vision. - The ForeseeHome device will be returned (1) after progression to CNV of the eye at risk, (2) at the end of the study, or (3) if use of the device produces unreliable results such that monitoring with the device becomes unreliable. Title: Treatment of Non-infectious Panuveitis, Intermediate and Posterior Uveitis Associated Macular Edema with Intravitreal Methotrexate Number: 11-EI-0107 Summary: Background: - Uveitis comprises of a group of diseases associated with inflammation of the eye that can lead to vision loss. Some people with uveitis also have macular edema (swelling of the retina at the back of the eye). Uveitis and macular edema are treated with medications and sometimes surgery, but treatment does not always prevent vision loss. Previous research has shown that injections of methotrexate into the eye of people with eye disease other than uveitis can help relieve the inflammation, or swelling, that causes macular edema and can slow visual loss. However, it has not yet been approved as a treatment for macular edema associated with uveitis. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of methotrexate injections as a treatment for macular edema associated with uveitis. Design: - This study requires at least nine visits to the National Eye Institute study clinic over a period of 6 months (24 weeks). - Participants will be screened with a full physical and ophthalmic examination, a medical history, blood and urine tests, and additional eye and other tests as needed. - Participants will receive a methotrexate injection in a selected treatment eye. After the injection, participants will receive antibiotic eye drops to place in the eye three times a day for the 3 days following the injection, leucovorin (folic acid) drops to place in the eye four times a day for 1 week following the injection, and a dose of folic acid to be taken by mouth the day after the injection. - Participants who tolerate the initial injection may continue to receive injections in their study eye every month for 6 months. After 6 months, participants who show improvement from the injections may be evaluated to receive additional injections every 4 to 8 weeks until researchers end the study. Title: A Phase I Unmasked Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of Subconjunctival Injections of Palomid 529 in Patients with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration Number: 11-EI-0066 Summary: Background: - Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, and leak blood and other fluids that damage the eye, produce scarring, and lead to blindness. People diagnosed with wet AMD have increased production of a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is important in the formation of blood vessels in the body, and decreasing the production of VEGF is believed to help wet AMD patients by preventing or slowing the growth of the abnormal blood vessels. Anti-VEGF drugs have been used to decrease the production of VEGF, but some people do not respond completely to these drugs. - A protein in the body called mTOR also plays a critical role in regulating how cells divide and grow and obtain their blood supply. The experimental chemical Palomid 529 inhibits the production of mTOR. Researchers are interested in determining whether Palomid 529 is safe and can help individuals with wet AMD who have not completely responded to anti-VEGF treatments. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Palomid 529 as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration in individuals who have not responded to standard anti-VEGF treatments. Design: - Prior to the first visit, participants should have been seen at the National Eye Institute clinic under a screening or teaching protocol, or NIH protocol 08-EI-0103, High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings in Induction Regimen of Intravitreal Ranibizumab Injection for Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration. One eye will be designated as the study eye to receive the Palomid 529 treatment. - Participants will have a full physical examination and medical history, a full eye examination to evaluate eye health and vision, angiography to examine the blood vessels in the eyes, and blood and urine tests during the study - Participants will receive an injection of Palomid 529 into the study eye every 4 weeks during the study, for a total of three injections. Participants may also receive anti-VEGF injections such as ranibizumab (Lucentis(Registered Trademark)) or bevacizumab (Avastin(Registered Trademark)) in the study eye 12 days before and 12 days after the Palomid 529 injection. - Participants may have standard-of-care treatments for the non-study eye if it has wet AMD as well, but may not receive experimental treatments in the non-study eye while they are in this study. - Participants will return for long-term follow-up examinations as directed by the study researchers. Title: Peptide B27PD (Optiquel) as Corticosteroid-Sparing Therapy for Chronic Non-Infectious Autoimmune Uveitis (BOOTS) Number: 10-EI-0191 Summary: Background: - Uveitis is a serious inflammatory condition in which the body's immune system attacks parts of the eye, often causing vision loss. Uveitis treatments involve various drugs that suppress the immune system, but these medicines sometimes do not work or may cause serious side effects. Researchers are interested in developing new treatments for uveitis that are more effective and have fewer side effects. - Optiquel(Trademark) is a natural product. It is an experimental medication being tested for its effectiveness again uveitis. It contains B27PD, a small protein fragment, which is similar to proteins in the parts of the eye being attacked by the immune system. Taking B27PD by mouth may induce oral tolerance, in which the immune system is taught to recognize and not attack normal parts of the human body. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of B27PD (Optiquel(Trademark)) as a treatment for uveitis. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, and an eye exam. - This study will last 52 weeks, with at least 17 study visits. - Participants will be divided into three groups, and will randomly be selected to receive one of two different doses of B27PD or a placebo. During the study, participants will also have their dose of prednisone or other steroid medication reduced. - Participants will take one pill three times per week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for a total of 26 weeks. The pill should be taken in the morning (at least 4 hours after eating and at least 30 minutes before eating). Participants may take the pill with water, but should not consume any other beverages or any kind of food until at least 30 minutes have passed to prevent stomach upset. The pills should be stored in the refrigerator. - During the first 12 weeks of the study, participants will have a study visit every 2 weeks. For the remainder of the study, participants will have a study visit every 4 weeks. Participants will have frequent blood and urine tests, and will also have eye examinations and special procedures (fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography) to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. Title: Microplasmin Intravitreal Administration in Participants with Uveitic Macular Edema Number: 10-EI-0186 Summary: Background: - Uveitis is a serious inflammatory condition in which the body's immune system attacks parts of the eye, often causing vision loss. Some people with uveitis also have macular edema (swelling of the retina at the back of the eye). Uveitis and macular edema are treated with medications and sometimes surgery, but in many people treatment does not prevent vision loss. - Research has shown that injection of the lab-made protein microplasmin into the eye of people with eye disease other than uveitis can help treat macular edema and can slow visual loss. Microplasmin has not been approved to treat uveitis; however, researchers are interested in determining if it can be a safe and effective treatment for macular edema related to uveitis. Objectives: - To investigate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of an intravitreal injection of microplasmin as a possible treatment for macular edema secondary to uveitis. Design: - Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, and an eye exam. - The study will last 6 months, and will require eight visits to the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic. Each visit will take about 3 to 4 hours. - At the first study visit, participants will have a complete physical and eye examination, medical history, blood tests, and two eye imaging studies (B-scan ultrasound and fluorescein angiography). After the tests are complete, participants will receive an injection of microplasmin directly into the eye. Participants will be given antibiotic eye drops to use three times a day for 3 days following the injection. - Participants will have regular follow-up visits for 6 months to evaluate the results of the microplasmin injection. These visits will include complete physical and eye examination, blood tests, and eye imaging studies (B-scan ultrasound and fluorescein angiography). Title: Evaluation of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in Patients with and without Diabetic Macular Edema Number: 10-EI-0169 Summary: Background: - Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common condition in people with diabetes. DME occurs when blood vessels in the eye leak fluid, resulting in swelling inside the back of the eye and progressive vision loss. Research has shown that good blood sugar control can reduce the risk and severity of DME. However, not all diabetic patients with poor blood sugar control develop DME, and some patients develop DME despite excellent blood sugar control. This suggests that other factors, such as genes or inherited traits, may predispose or protect a diabetic patient from developing DME. Objectives: - To investigate genetic factors that may influence the development of diabetic macular edema. Design: - The study will require one visit to the National Institutes of Health eye clinic. - Participants will be screened with a medical history and basic eye examination. Individuals who have certain eye diseases other than DME may not be allowed to enroll in the study. - Participants will provide a blood sample, and will receive fluorescein angiography (an injection of fluorescein dye, after which a camera will take pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels in the eye). - No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol. Title: Genotype-Phenotype Study of Patients with Plaquenil(Registered Trademark)-Induced Retinal Toxicity, with Evaluation of the ABCA4 Gene Number: 10-EI-0140 Summary: Background: - Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is an anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat some autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. This drug can damage the retina by causing a condition called plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity, which may lead to vision loss. However, most people taking plaquenil do not develop this problem. Researchers are interested in studying whether differences in a person's genes explain why some people develop plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity while others do not. Objectives: - To investigate possible correlations between certain genes or genetic mutations and plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity. Design: - The study requires one or two visits to the National Eye Institute or an outpatient study clinic over a maximum 2-year period. - Participants will provide a personal and family medical history, and will have a full eye examination. - Participants will also provide blood samples for testing. - No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol. Title: A Pilot Study for the Evaluation of Minocycline as a Microglia Inhibitor in the Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema Number: 10-EI-0098 Summary: Background: - Diabetic retinopathy, or damage to the small blood vessels at the back of the eye, is a frequent complication of diabetes, and is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy can lead to swelling within the eye, known as diabetic macular edema which causes vision loss. - Chronic inflammation has been implicated in diabetic macular edema. Microglia are cells in the retina involved in inflammation in the retina. For these reasons, microglia represent a promising cellular target for forms of therapy that limit the harmful inflammatory changes found in diabetic retinopathy. Minocycline, a drug that is currently approved for use as an antibiotic, may be able to inhibit microglia and thus reduce their contribution to chronic inflammation. Researchers are interested in examining whether minocycline may be used to treat or slow the progress of diabetic macular edema. Objectives: - To test the safety and effectiveness of minocycline as a treatment for diabetic macular edema. Design: - This study will last 2 years and require at least 14 visits to the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic. Study visits will be every month for the first 2 months and then every other month. Each visit will take about 2 to 4 hours. - Participants will take minocycline tablets twice daily for 24 months. - During each study visit, participants will have full eye examinations to measure visual activity, retinal thickness, and blood flow to the eye. Participants will also have regular blood tests, including blood sugar tests. - Patients enrolled will have been previously treated with focal laser, or not amenable to focal laser treatment. At the Month 6, Month 12 and Month 18 visits, participants will be offered laser treatment if they are eligible, unless they have shown significant improvement in retinal thickness or visual acuity. - After the end of the study, follow-up care will be arranged with an outside ophthalmologist. Title: Immunogenetic Mechanisms in Behcet's Disease Number: 10-EI-0093 Summary: Background: - Uveitis, the inflammation of the interior of the eye, is responsible for numerous new cases of legal blindness every year. Uveitis can be caused by Beh et's disease (BD), a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the eye, mucous membranes, and other body organs such as the joints, intestinal tract, blood vessels, and central nervous system. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to see how genes affect Beh et's disease and if there are differences in Beh et's disease among people of different backgrounds. Design: - As part of the study, blood samples will be drawn from participants when an exacerbation in disease activity occurs and before and after any significant change in treatment for BD. - No treatments will be provided in this study. Title: Rituximab for Autoimmune Retinopathy Number: 10-EI-0040 Summary: Background: - Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) is an inflammatory condition in which the patient's own immune system is attacking his or her eyes and causing vision loss. Patients with AIR are generally treated with immunosuppressive agents to treat the eye inflammation; however, the standard treatment for this disease is still being developed. - Rituximab, an immunosuppressive agent,\",\n",
       " 'We are studying the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and the molecular basis for virulence and attenuation of these important pathogens.  In collaborative studies with Dr. Frank Chisari (Scripps Institute) we  studied in chimpanzees the mechanism by which the host clears a hepatitis B virus infection and the relationship of these mechanisms to clinical disease. We demonstrated that the clearance of the template for HBV synthesis, covalently closed circular HBV DNA, is eliminated from hepatocytes by non-cytolytic mechanisms mediated principally by interferon gamma in the liver. Elimination of residual hepatocytes containing HBV antigens is a later event that is mediated by cytolytic CD8 positive T cells and is temporally related to the hepatitis phase of the infection. The spectrum of virus-induced and immune response-related genes involved in acute hepatitis B were further studied by microarray analysis of intrahepatic messenger RNAs up-regulated and down-regulated during the course of hepatitis B infections in chimpanzees. Surprisingly, we could not detect evidence of an innate immune response to infection, suggesting that HBV can subvert the host immune response, but we did detect a strong adaptive immune response during the clearance phase of infection; this correlated with the inhibition of viral replication and removal of infected cells described above. Interestingly, in additional studies of chronic HBV infection in chimpanzees, we found an innate immune response that was missing in acute, self-limiting infections of HBV.  This occurred at a time of liver damage, suggesting that viral and cellular products released from dead and dying hepatocytes could trigger other innate host defenses, such as TLR-3. However, the up-regulated innate immune responses were weak and insufficient to affect virus replication.The genetic heterogeneity of hepatitis C virus is believed to play an important role in its pathogenicity. We have previously examined this relationship by determining the genetic heterogeneity of HCV isolates that were recovered from patients who were infected following transfusion in order to study the early phase of infection and from patients undergoing interferon therapy in order to study changes during the later phase of chronic infection (these may be important in understanding late sequelae, such as liver cancer). Distinctive patterns of dynamic change in the sequence of viral clones during the first several weeks of infection were observed and these correlated with the outcome of infection. Similarly, the pattern of dynamic changes in sequence during interferon therapy was predictive of the outcome. These findings may be useful in predicting the outcome of therapy with interferon early in the course of treatment. Although considerable information has been gained from these longitudinal studies of patients, it is difficult to study the mechanisms of pathogenesis in such systems. Chimpanzees, which are the only animals other than man that are susceptible to infection with HCV, provide an experimental model for studying the interactions of the host and the virus in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C.  Recent studies in chimpanzees suggest that even late sequelae like liver cancer can be studied in the chimpanzee.  Collaborative studies with Frank Chisari have demonstrated that, as in hepatitis B virus infections, in hepatitis C virus infections the cellular immune response plays an important role in noncytolytic down-regulation of viral replication and cytolytic removal of residual infected cells. These two mechanisms are sequential and overlapping and the former appears to be mediated by interferon gamma and the latter by CD8 positive cells and, perhaps by interferon gamma through its proinflammatory activity. These studies have also revealed that type 1 interferon (interferon alpha/beta)-activated antiviral proteins are expressed in response to the viral infections, but that HCV is resistant to the antiviral activity of this innate immune response. Microarray studies of the host immune responses to viral hepatitis and how the hepatitis viruses attempt to circumvent the responses, are yielding important information on pathogenesis of these diseases, and the studies are being extended to the other hepatitis viruses in order to delineate the comparative pathogenesis of these agents in a single host, the chimpanzee, which is the only non-human host that is susceptible to all human hepatitis viruses. In 2010, we completed a microarray analysis of HCV and HEV infections of multiple chimpanzees, comparing the sequence of human and chimpanzee genomes for suitability in interpreting Affymetrix microarray data obtained from serial clinical samples of chimpanzees infected with one or the other of the two viruses.  We found that the human genome sequence was more sensitive and specific for identifying up-regulated and down-regulated genes, probably because it is better curated than the more recently sequenced chimpanzee genome.  We also compared two analytic methods, a method utilizing Affymetrix probe sets and correlation coefficients with one utilizing individual perfectly matched probes and t-test analysis.  Both analyses demonstrated similarities and differences in the host immune response to these two RNA viruses.  This information will be useful for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis.Currently, we are also studying the pathogenesis of HDV infections by microarray analysis and have identified both innate and adaptive immune responses to such infections. Immune responses to HDV infection were similar to those we observed during HCV infection: both a strong innate and a strong adaptive immune response.  The innate immune response was sufficient to down-regulate HBV replication in HBV chronically infected chimpanzees that were superinfected with HDV. Thus, HBV, although unable to trigger an innate immune response, is highly sensitive to such a response when provided by another virus.In 2011 we reproduced in cell culture the quasispecies evolution of HCV that had first been observed in vivo in chimpanzees that had been administered antibody to HCV.  The dynamics of quasispecies change over time were remarkably similar in vivo and in vitro.In other collaborative studies, we measured changes in the HCV receptors scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1), claudin-1 and occludin after liver transplantation and the influence of such changes on early viral kinetics.  There was a significant correlation between the amount of SRB1 in the liver at the time of reperfusion of the transplanted liver and the decay of the serum HCV-RNA titer, suggesting that a greater distribution of the receptor led to more rapid uptake of the virus by the liver.  Similarly, higher levels of claudin-1 and occludin in the liver correlated with more rapid recurrence of HCV in the transplanted liver, additional evidence of their importance in the uptake and replication of HCV in hepatocytes.In 2012 we mapped mutations in HCV genotype 2a and 2b viruses that permitted the viruses to replicate robustly in cell culture, thereby extending the list of viruses and providing a systematic approach for adapting additional HCV strains to in vitro culture.  In addition, we studied the host response to HCV infection in chimpanzees and demonstrated the dominant but transitory role of CD8+ T cells in early viral evolution.',\n",
       " 'The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus and comprise some of the most medically significant emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. TBFV include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, deer tick virus (DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. Other medically relevant flaviviruses include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Hence, research into the pathogenesis of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of this globally important group of viruses.  The research in our laboratory aims to identify and understand interactions between the TBFV and their hosts (both the arthropod and the mammal) critical to virus replication and pathogenesis. We study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV.  Studies using LGTV will form the basis for work on the more virulent BSL-3 DTV and BSL-4 TBFV. Analysis of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. Ixodid ticks represent the natural reservoir of TBFV, are critical for virus persistence in nature, and are the major vector for infection of humans. Transmission of flaviviruses to humans occurs during tick feeding.  We have developed a first generation microarray to investigate salivary gland transcriptional changes in Ixodes scapularis nymphs during feeding or after infection with LGTV. The immediate goal of this work is to identify tick salivary gland transcripts that play a role during feeding or for the replication or transmission of TBFV.  The long-term goal of this work is to identify novel tick salivary gland genes that could be targeted for the development of vaccines that have the potential to disrupt tick feeding and/or flavivirus transmission. In 2012, we published the results of our microarray analysis of LGTV-infected and uninfected ticks has identified 39 differentially regulated salivary gland transcripts over a time course of feeding. Differentially regulated transcripts were annotated based on current knowledge from the Ixodes scapularis genome.  These transcripts are classified as putative secreted proteins, lipocalins, Kunitz protease inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, serpins, metalloproteases and transcripts of unknown function.  .   Pursuing these results in 2012, we expressed several recombinant tick salivary gland proteins.  The proteins  were expressed in a baculovirus system and are being tested for their effect on flavivirus replication in vitro on relevant cell types such as tick and mammalian cells.  Also in 2012, we developed a novel in vivo model for flavivirus infection that mimics a tick bite by inoculating virus into the ear pinna.  This route of inoculation was successful at inducing neuronal death, encephalitis and meningitis in 3 week old mice inoculated with Langat virus.  In addition to studying viral pathogenesis in the mammalian host, this model allows for the analysis of the local skin infection in the ear and the draining lymph nodes.  The model will enable us to assess in an in vivo system the importance of the recombinant salivary gland proteins on TBFV infection. These experiments will utilize deer tick virus, a North American TBFV in the TBEV serocomplex.  Comparison of TBFV infection in mammalian and tick cells.  A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. In work submitted for publication, we have compared virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography.  Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum.  Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems.  In contrast to mammalian cells, TBFV-infection in tick cells shows delayed and decreased membrane proliferation.  Additionally, electron tomography of infected tick cells shows a shift from spherical vesicles to tubular profiles, especially in the context of persistently infected cells.  In the case of WNV and DEN, viral non-structural protein 4A has been implicated in the membrane rearrangements occurring during infection.  Building upon our previous work, we are exploring the role of NS4A in TBFV infection and continuing to evaluate cellular mechanisms that allow persistent infection of tick cells.Viral determinants of pathogenicity. Previous data collected in this lab demonstrated that upon passaging of the tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in ISE-6 tick cells, three coding mutations (M:K115E, NS3:F604L, and NS4A:A81V) arose within the LGTV genome.   This virus was subsequently demonstrated to have reduced neuroinvasiveness as examined by intraperitoneal infection of three week old laboratory mice.  We obtained a LGTV infectious clone in order to identify which of these previously identified mutations were responsible for the altered neuroinvasiveness of this virus.  The sequence of the LGTV infectious clone contained several coding mutations and thus these firstly were removed, exception of a D308A mutation within the E protein gene, which following several attempts, was not able to be removed.  Following the removal of these mutations, the ISE-6 tick cell adaptations were introduced as single mutations or in combination to engineer a recombinant triple-mutant.  These viruses were subsequently rescued in Vero cells, assessed by immunofocus assay, and demonstrated to display a small-plaque phenotype.  Three week old mice were subsequently infected intraperitoneally with these viruses, as well as a non-recombinant wildtype LGTV, and examined for weight-loss and survival.  Infection with the non-recombinant LGTV resulted in 70% survival whereas 100% of mice infected with the recombinant viruses survived until the end of the experiment (28dpi).  The only coding difference between the non-recombinant wildtype LGTV and the wildtype recombinant LGTV is the E:D308A mutation.  Further examination of published literature revealed that this mutation has been demonstrated to affect neuroinvasiveness and plaque size of another tick-borne flavivirus, Louping Ill virus.  Thus it is therefore likely that this E:D308A mutation is the cause of the decreased neuroinvasiveness seen in our studies.',\n",
       " '(1) To develop animal, especially nonhuman primate, models that mimic human disease:We have established nonhuman primate (NHPs) models using Cynomolgus macaques for several influenza A viruses. Seasonal H1N1 & H3N2 viruses lead to either asymptomatic or fairly mild disease in Cynomolgus macaques. Gross pathology is limited to a few areas in the lungs. Histopathological investigations revealed alveolar edema and fibrin, hyaline membrane formation and type II alveolar pneumocyte hyperplasia. Animals recover quickly from the infection and clear virus within the first few days. There is limited evidence for virus shedding. (Brining 2010; Safronetz 2011)  The pandemic H2N2 strain A/Singapore/1/57 leads to a moderate infection compared to the seasonal strains. Lung infiltrates, gross pathology and histopathology are in general slightly enhanced. Animals clear the infection with a delay and fully recover. There is limited evidence for virus shedding (Richt, 2012).  We observed different degrees of clinical severity, gross pathology, lung infiltration and histology in macaques infected with three distinct pandemic H1N1 isolates. A Mexican strain isolated from a moderately sick human A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) (M4108) behaved similarly to the pandemic H2N2 strain. A California isolate from a sick boy with moderate disease A/California/4/2009 (H1N1) (Ca04) was more severe and another Mexico strain from a cluster of severe cases A/Mexico/4487/2009 (H1N1) (M4487) was severe in clinical disease and pathology. This clearly indicates that a variety of strains co-circulated with different pathogenic potential. (Brining 2010; Safronetz 2011; Feldmann, in preparation)  Infection with the swine H2N3 virus A/swine/MS/06 was also more severe and was similar to the disease caused by Ca04. Thus, this newly described swine virus has potential to infect primates and thus, could potentially also infect humans (Richt, 2012).  Furthermore, we have established the ferret model for influenza viruses. We have compared disease progression and virus replication of two pandemic H1N1 viruses (M4108, M4487). In contrast to the differences we observed in the nonhuman primate model, both infections did not really differ in the ferret model with both viruses causing mild respiratory disease. (Tsuda, in preparation)(2) To identify and characterize determinants of pathogenicity in animal models:To better understand the features that define highly lethal influenza viruses, we exploited a technology for the artificial generation and modification of influenza viruses (reverse genetics system). Using this technology, we have generated a consensus pandemic H1N1 virus (parent virus). In order to study virulence of the different strains and the mechanisms of pathogenesis we have generated selected recombinant viruses and characterized those mutants in vitro.  For this we have compared the genome sequences of two early circulating pandemic H1N1 strains with different pathogenicity in humans (M4108, M4487). Sequence comparison revealed amino acid changes in 5 genome segments, PB2, PA, HA, NP and M. The recombinant viruses were generated on the background of M4108 by replacing the corresponding genomic segment. We have characterized the recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo (ferret) and found preliminary evidence for a role of PB2 and PA. (Tsuda, in preparation) Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. This seems also be the case with the latest pandemic H1N1 virus. In order to study a potentiating effect of influenza and bacterial co-infection we performed a co-infection study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 followed by MRSA showed enhanced clinical disease (Kobayashi, in preparation). We are currently working on the potential mechanism. Similar studies were performed with a seasonal viruses (H1N1, H3N2) and MRSA in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement.(3) To identify potential targets for intervention:The inherent virulence properties of past (i.e. 1918 virus) and potential future pandemic influenza viruses (i.e. highly virulent H5N1) indicates the need for evaluating antiviral options. Therefore, the recently developed Cynomolgus macaque model for the 1918 influenza virus was used for a drug efficacy study. We demonstrated that oseltamivir phosphate is effective in preventing severe disease in Cynomolgus macaques caused by the 1918 influenza virus if given prophylactically. Efficacy was reduced in a treatment regime through emergence of oseltamivir-resistant mutants that led to the death of one of four animals.  This emphasizes the importance of implementing combination therapy and vaccination strategies early in a pandemic. (Feldmann, in revision)In a first attempt to identify new targets for intervention we have performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of acute host responses to infection with pandemic H1N1 (Ca04) in mice, macaques and swine.  We observed differences in inflammatory molecules elicited, and the kinetics of their gene expression changes across these species, including genes regulated by nuclear receptor signaling molecules controlling lipid and metabolic processes impacting inflammatory responses to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.  While the heterodimeric retinoid X receptor (RXR) signaling pathway was differentially regulated during infection in each species, divergent expression of lipid-binding molecules and NFB molecules was observed across species.  By comparing transcriptional changes across hosts in the context of clinical and virological measures and integrating evidence from transcription factor analyses, we were able to examine similarities and differences in acute host responses to pandemic H1N1 influenza infection across hosts. (Go, in revision)  (4) To develop cross-protective vaccines and test their efficacy in the developed animal models:In collaboration (Dr. J. Rose) we have generated and characterized VSV-based vaccines that express the HK/156 (clade 0) H5 HA from the first position of the VSV genome. These vectors induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses of different clades in mice. The vaccines provide complete protection against morbidity and mortality after heterologous challenge with clade 0 and clade 1 strains in animals even 1 year after vaccination. Therefore, VSV-based avian influenza vaccines are potent, broadly cross-protective pandemic vaccine candidates (Schwartz 2010). More recently we started a collaborative project (Dr. M. Jarvis) to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses. Our approach is based on two observations: i) highly conserved B cell epitopes are present within two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk region, and antibodies against them affords heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region can increase antibody responses against other normally poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus vector platform for these studies, which is able to induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody) following a single vaccination. The vectors have been made and we are currently testing immunogenicity.',\n",
       " 'Findings from FY12 are summarized below.1.  Orthopoxvirus pathogenesisA goal of EVPS is to understand virus-host interactions and exploit them for countermeasure development.  Here, we sought to use a systems kinomics approach to characterize the host cell response to MPXV strains of varying virulence and identify host targets for development of therapeutics. MPXV is comprised of two clades: Congo Basin MPXV, with an associated case fatality rate of 10%, and Western African MPXV, which is associated with less severe infection and minimal lethality. We thus postulated that Congo Basin and West African MPXV would differentially modulate host cell responses and, as many host responses are regulated through phosphorylation independent of transcription or translation, we employed systems kinomics with peptide arrays to investigate these responses. We demonstrated that Congo Basin MPXV infection selectively downregulates host responses as compared to West African MPXV, including growth factor- and apoptosis-related responses. These results were confirmed using FACS analysis demonstrating that West African MPXV infection resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis in human monocytes as compared to Congo Basin MPXV. Further, differentially phosphorylated kinases were identified through comparison of our MPXV data sets and validated as potential targets for pharmacological inhibition of Congo Basin MPXV infection, including increased Akt S473 phosphorylation and decreased p53 S15 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt S473 phosphorylation resulted in a significant decrease in Congo Basin MPXV virus yield (261-fold) but did not affect West African MPXV. In addition, treatment with staurosporine, an apoptosis activator resulted in a 49-fold greater decrease in Congo Basin MPXV yields as compared to West African MPXV. Thus, using a systems kinomics approach, our investigation demonstrated that West African and Congo Basin MPXV differentially modulate host cell responses, and we identified potential host targets of therapeutic interest. We have initiated a similar systems kinomics analysis of Ebola virus infection of monocytes and epithelial cells.We have also continued our studies of monkeypox pathogenesis in nonhuman primates.  In FY2012, we performed a statistical analysis of previously acquired data from NHPs infected with MPXV to attempt to identify biomarkers that associate with disease severity.  We applied a novel statistical technique, Backward Matched Longitudinal Analysis, to several clinical and immunological parameters measured during MPXV infection of NHPs.  Our analysis identified that high concentrations of MCP-1 were strongly associated with non-survival, while higher viremia and IL-1ra and G-CSF concentrations were weakly associated with non-survival.  Increased IFN-gamma and RANTES concentrations were weakly associated with survival.  These studies have defined targets for further study in investigations of viral pathogenesis, disease staging, and countermeasure development.  In collaboration with NIAID Integrated Research Facility investigators, we also identified an additional biomarker that can be used to monitor disease progression; poxvirus antigen staining of monocytes and granulocytes.  We found that NHPs with positive detection of poxvirus antigens in monocytes and granulocytes by flow cytometric staining succumbed to virus infection and that early positive pox staining is a strong predictor for lethality. Ten NHPs displayed positive pox-staining and all 10 NHPs reached moribund endpoint.  In contrast, none of three NHPs that survived the challenge showed apparent virus staining in their immune cells. Furthermore, data from a CPXV study also demonstrated that 6/9 NHPs showed positive pox-staining and all 6 NHPs reached moribund endpoint. In contrast, the three survivors were pox-staining negative. Thus, we conclude that monitoring of virus infection of immune cells can be used as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of virus infection as early as day 2 post-infection. Finally, we have further explored the use of FDG-PET/CT imaging to monitor MPXV infection in NHPs.  Six rhesus macaques were infected intravenously with a sublethal dose of MPXV. Three animals were treated with a dose of cidofovir (CDV) that has been shown to protect against MPXV, while three animals served as the untreated control group. CDV-treated NHPs survived and had a 1,000-fold reduction in viral load.  Two NHPs in the untreated control group succumbed and one survived. PET imaging showed that monkeypox infection lead to an increase in 18-FDG uptake in the bone marrow in all six animals early in infection (day 3/4 post inoculation). However, the 2 moribund NHPs had significantly higher uptake of 18-FDG in the bone marrow (SUV mean 4.2) than the 4 surviving NHPs (SUV mean 2.9). Furthermore, nonsurvivors also had significantly higher FDG uptake in axillary lymph nodes at day 3/4 post-infection.  Thus, analysis of 18-FDG uptake and LN size resulted in identification of two patterns that differed between moribund and surviving NHPs. These studies indicate that analysis of structural and functional changes of LNs and bone marrow during infection may be a useful in vivo approach to monitor monkeypox pathogenesis. 2.  Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and Ebola virusWe have previously developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University.  Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. In FY12, we further characterized the immunogenicity and safety of these vaccine candidates in mice.  Both live and killed vaccines induced primary EBOV GP-specific T-cells and a robust recall response as measured by interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay.  In addition to cellular immunity, an effective filovirus vaccine will likely require a multivalent humoral immune response against multiple virus species.  As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrated that inactivated RV-GP could be formulated with another inactivated RABV vaccine expressing the nontoxic fragment of botulinum neurotoxin A heavy chain without a reduction in immunity to each component.  Finally, we demonstrated that humoral immunity to GP could be induced by immunization of mice with inactivated RV-GP in the presence of pre-existing immunity to RABV.  The ability of these novel vaccines to induce strong humoral and cellular immunity indicates that they should be further evaluated in additional animal models of infection. We also further characterized the pathogenesis of the live-attenuated RABV/EBOV vaccine candidates in mice in an effort to define their growth properties and potential for safety.  We are considering live vaccines for use in wildlife.  RABV vaccines expressing GP (RV-GP) or a replication-deficient derivative with a deletion of the RABV G gene (RVdelG-GP) are both avirulent after intracerebral inoculation of adult mice.  Furthermore, RVdelG-GP is completely avirulent upon intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice unlike parental RABV vaccine or RV-GP.  Analysis of RVdelG-GP in the brain by quantitative PCR, determination of virus titer, and immunohistochemistry indicated greatly restricted virus replication.  In summary, our findings indicated that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, and RVdelG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use.',\n",
       " 'The host innate immune response is triggered within hours of virus infection. As a whole, its function is to limit virus replication at local sites of infection and to orchestrate development of the adaptive immune response. Viruses are typically recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-like RNA helicases (RLHs). Ligation of these PRRs, often by viral nucleic acids, culminates in the activation of multiple transcription factors that cooperate in driving expression of cytokines and chemokines characteristic of the innate response. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) are particularly important transcription factors, responsible for induction of type I IFN (IFNalpha/beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and other mediators of inflammation. IFNalpha/beta is central to the anti-viral response as it initiates its own transcriptional program resulting in expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway.  ISG expression influences many cellular processes including RNA processing, protein stability and cell viability that can directly affect virus replication. ISG expression in cells of the immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages is critical for antigen presentation and T- and B-cell activation, thus affecting the quality of the adaptive immune response and eventual virus clearance. To facilitate dissemination, pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to suppress host innate immunity by antagonizing these signal transduction pathways. Hence, understanding the specific pathways by which viruses activate and evade innate immune responses is essential for understanding viral pathogenesis as well as for development of effective vaccines.   To examine virus-host interactions that affect innate immunity, our laboratory utilizes flaviviruses as the primary model of infection. Flaviviruses have an essentially global distribution and represent a tremendous disease burden to humans, causing millions of infections annually. The success of flaviviruses as human pathogens is associated with the fact that they are arthropod-borne, transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks. Significant members of this group include dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) that cause hemorrhagic fevers, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) that cause severe encephalitides. These viruses are listed as NIAID category A, B and C pathogens for research into their basic biology and host response. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated as one open reading frame; the resulting polyprotein is cleaved into at least ten proteins that include three structural (capsid C, membrane M, derived from the precursor preM and envelope E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). Virus replication proceeds in association with modified membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of host cells. NS5 is the largest and most conserved of the flavivirus proteins containing approximately 900 amino acids. It encodes a methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and associates with NS3 (the viral protease) to form the functional unit of the viral replication complex. Despite the widespread and often severe infections caused by these pathogens, vaccines exist for only a few (YFV, JEV and TBEV) and no therapeutic exists to treat clinical infection caused by any flavivirus.Type I IFNs are essential to recovery from flavivirus infection and have been used clinically as potential therapeutics, albeit with limit success. This may be due to the observation that all flaviviruses examined to date antagonize IFN-dependent responses by suppressing JAK-STAT signal transduction. We identified NS5 as the major IFN antagonist encoded by flaviviruses, originally using Langat virus (LGTV; a member of the TBEV complex of flaviviruses) and most recently using WNV. Although other NS proteins contribute to suppression of JAK-STAT signaling, studies by our laboratory and others suggest that NS5 is the most potent of the IFN antagonist proteins encoded by all vector-borne flaviviruses examined thus far.  Hence, determining the mechanism(s) by which NS5 impedes signaling is essential to understand flavivirus pathogenesis and may lead to new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the anti-viral effects of IFN by identifying the function of ISGs with anti-viral activity. Finally, it is essential to translate these findings to immunologically relevant cell types and animal models to understand the roles of induction and evasion of innate immunity in development of the adaptive immune response and in virus pathogenesis.Our progress this year includes the demonstration that the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein, TRIM79alpha is an ISG that specifically targets TBEV. TRIM79alpha restricts TBEV replication by mediating lysosome-dependent degradation of the flavivirus NS5 protein. NS5 degradation was specific to tick-borne flaviviruses as TRIM79alpha did not recognize NS5 from WNV or inhibit WNV replication. In the absence of TRIM79alpha, IFN-beta was less effective in inhibiting tick-borne flavivirus infection of mouse macrophages, highlighting the importance of a single virus-specific ISG in establishing an antiviral state. The specificity of TRIM79alpha for TBEV reveals a remarkable ability of the innate IFN response to discriminate between closely related flaviviruses.We have also examined the effects of flavivirus infection of DC maturation. Maturation of DCs and their subsequent ability to initiate adaptive immune responses is coordinated by PRR ligation, transcription factor activation and type I IFN) production. Early activation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor, results in expression of broadly acting antiviral effector genes including interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine that plays an essential role in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. To understand the impact of tick-borne flaviviruses on DC responses, we examined the maturation profile and cytokine response of murine bone marrow-derived DCs infected with Langat virus (LGTV; a member of the TBEV serogroup). In response to PRR stimulation, LGTV infected DCs showed enhanced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6, but suppressed IL-12 compared to uninfected cells in the same culture or mock-infected controls. The differential modulation of IL-12 was due to reduced expression of IL-12p40 mRNA, but not that of IL-12p35. Kinetic analysis revealed that early IL-12p40 mRNA expression required IRF-1 whereas sustained gene expression was dependent on signaling through the IFN receptor (IFNAR). Examination of IRF-1 status revealed that LGTV or TBEV infection resulted in accelerated IRF-1 degradation. Moreover, DCs enriched from LGTV infected Ifnar-/- mice showed impaired IRF-1 nuclear localization. Irf-1-/- mice were highly susceptible to LGTV infection suggesting that IRF-1 antagonism contributes to virus pathogenesis. Thus, IRF-1 degradation is a novel mechanism that synergizes with the noted ability of flaviviruses to suppress IFNAR-dependent signaling, resulting in the orchestrated evasion of host innate immunity.',\n",
       " 'Wild mouse species and the various inbred laboratory mouse strains differ from one another in their susceptibility to the mouse gammaretroviruses and retrovirus-induced cancers. These differences are due to variations in specific host genes, and we have been engaged in an ongoing effort to identify and characterize several mouse genes involved in virus resistance.  Our major interest has been focused on factors that interfere directly with virus infection and replication, and we focus our efforts on those factors that inhibit virus entry and the early post-entry stages of the virus replicative cycle.  At the level of entry, there are two types of resistance genes that target the receptor-virus interaction.  Receptors can be blocked by virus envelope glycoprotein produced by endogenous retroviruses, or resistance can be caused by polymorphisms in the cell surface receptor.  After the gammaretrovirus enters the receptive cell, reverse transcription and translocation to the nucleus can be inhibited or altered by virus resistance factors Fv1, mApobec/Rfv3, and TRIM5alpha.Our current aim is to characterize these resistance factors and the viruses they target, define the origin and extent of antiviral activity in Mus evolution, and elucidate the responsible mechanisms.  This work relies heavily on wild mice because laboratory strains provide only a limited sampling of the genetic diversity in Mus.  Also, wild mouse species allow us to examine survival strategies in natural populations that harbor virus and to follow the evolution of the resistance genes.  These mice additionally provide a source of novel resistance genes and virus variants.  One set of projects aims to identify viral and cell receptor determinants responsible for virus binding and entry.  We are currently working on the XPR1 receptor for the xenotropic/polytropic mouse gammaretroviruses (XP-MLVs). We have determined that, in mouse populations exposed to infectious virus, virus resistance is mediated by polymorphisms of the cell surface receptor. We have now identified a total of four XPR1 susceptibility variants in wild mice and described the geographic and species distribution of the Mus Xpr1 variants. Three of the four receptors restrict entry by two or more of the virus host range variants that rely on XPR1, and all three of these receptors evolved in populations exposed to X-MLVs. Because XPR1 homologues are found in all eukaryotes, and because all mammals but the laboratory mouse have X-MLV susceptible receptors, we looked for naturally occurring restrictive receptors in a related set of species outside the mammalian lineage.  We found restrictive receptors in chickens as well as in other fowl and raptor species, and demonstrated that the gene is under positive selection which is evidence of genetic conflicts that can result from antagonistic interactions with pathogens.  All of the birds with disabling mutations are native to areas of Asia populated by the virus-infected mouse species M. m. castaneus, suggesting that contact between these species favored selection of mouse virus-resistant receptors in the birds.  In another series of experiments, we have been using phylogenetic methods to identify and characterize host genes that have had an anti-viral role in the genus Mus. Among the mouse genes responsible for resistance to mouse leukemia viruses is the mouse APOBEC (mA3) gene, a cytidine deaminase gene known to restrict other retroviruses in mice and in humans.  In previous studies we  discovered that the mA3 allele in virus resistant mice is disrupted by insertion of the regulatory signals of a mouse leukmia virus that correlated with enhanced mA3 expression in virus resistant mouse strains and species.  We also identified sites in mA3 under positive selection that specify residues in two loops along the groove that forms the mA3 active site.  More recently we focused on the fact that mA3 transcripts have different splicing patterns in virus-resistant mice like C57BL/6 compared with virus-sensitive strains like BALB/c.  C57BL/6 transcripts lack exon 5; this exon is spliced into mA3 of BALB/c and separates the two cytidine deaminase domains. We have now showed that mA3 exon 5 is a functional element that influences protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level.  We also used in vitro splicing assays to identify two critical polymorphisms affecting the inclusion of exon 5 into mA3 transcripts: the number of TCCT repeats upstream of exon 5 and a single nucleotide substitition within exon 5.  We also found that distribution of exon 5 into mA3 mRNA is a relatively recent event in the evolution of mice.  The widespread geographic distribution of the exon 5-including genetic variant suggests that in some Mus populations the cost of maintaining an effective but mutagenic enzyme may outweigh its antiviral function. One of the unique features of gammaretroviruses is that they contain an additional extended form of the gag polyprotein, termed glycogag.  This glycoprotein is thought to promote virus replication and have a role in disease progression.  We made use of a recently isolated gammaretrovirus, termed XMRV, which is the only known virus that lacks the consensus glycogag sequence.  We did functional assays to confirm that this virus lacks glycogag function, and we analyzed the endogenous copies of the gammaretroviruses in the sequenced genome for glycogag.  We found that glycogag was missing from two subgroups of these leukemia viruses, indicating that loss of this sequence is a relatively recent event with limited subspecies distribution.Few mouse leukemia viruses are cytopathic, and these few viruses have restricted host range.  We forced passaged one of these cytopathic viruses in restrictive cells and isolated a novel variant that has broad mouse-tropic host range, and is cytopathic in all mouse cells.  We identified a single second site mutation in the envelope glycoprotein of this virus responsible for its expanded host range.  This site is not positioned within the receptor binding pocket of the envelope glycoprotein, but is at the apex of this glycoprotein, where it is likely to have secondary contacts with the receptor.',\n",
       " 'Approach 1: Understand and improve on the protective efficacy of ALVAC & gp120 vaccination. In the last several years we have investigated vaccine approaches for HIV, based on DNA alone or in combination with poxvirus-based vaccines, and found that these vaccine modalities are able to elicit mainly memory T-cells, and when combined with gp120 protein boost can induce high titer binding antibodies. Vaccination induced anti-envelope antibodies in all vaccinees and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Approximately, one third of the vaccinated macaques were protected from SIVmac251 acquisition, whereas the remaining infected vaccinees progressed to disease. The magnitude of vaccine induced SIVmac251 specific T-cell responses and binding antibodies were not significantly different in protected or infected animals. However, sera from protected animals had higher avidity antibodies to gp120, recognized the variable envelope region V2, and reduced SIVmac251 infectivity in cells that express high level of alpha4 beta7 integrins, suggesting a functional role of antibodies to V2. Mucosal exposure of vaccinated macaques to SIVmac251 faithfully reproduced results in humans, suggesting that this model is instrumental in the development of more efficacious vaccines for HIV.  Approach 2: We investigated the impact of SIVmac251 challenge dose on the efficacy of a DNA prime/ALVAC-SIV/ gp120 protein boost vaccine regimen. Infection was neither prevented nor modified following a single high dose of challenge of the immunized macaques. However, exposure to a tenfold lower dose resulted in protection from SIVmac251 acquisition and modulated pathogenesis (decrease CD4+ T-cell loss) in animals that did become infected. The challenge dose did not affect expression of inflammatory genes in the gut during acute infection, but at viremia set point, a significant down regulation of interferon responsive genes and up regulation of genes involved in B and T-cell responses was observed only in vaccinated animals exposed to a lower dose of SIVmac251. In these animals we also found a significant correlation between vaccine induced T-cell responses and protection from CD4+ T-cell loss. We conclude that challenge virus dose can influence relative vaccine efficacy in the Non Human Primate (NHP) model Approach 3: We compared the relative efficacy against simian AIDS of three vaccine regimens that elicited similar frequency of SIV specific CD4+, CD8+ but differed in the level of antibody responses to the gp120 envelope protein. While two of the vaccine regimens protected from high levels of SIV replication only during the acute phase of infection, the third strategy protected during both the acute and the chronic phase of infection and was associated with a better reconstitution of CD4+ T-cells at mucosal sites. All three vaccine regimens elicited equivalent frequencies of SIV-specific T-cells but differed in the elicitation of antibodies to the SIV gp120. The vaccinated group with durable protection had the highest titer of binding antibody to gp120, persistent Gag CD8+ CM9+ effector memory with low expression of surface Program Death-1 (PD-1) receptor, and pro- apoptotic genes, and high levels of expression of genes associated with MHC-I and II antigen. Since, protection from Simian AIDS was associated with high titers of antibodies to the SIV Envelope protein, durable effector SIV-specific CD8+ T-cells that express less pro-apoptotic genes and more genes associated with MHC-I or II antigens presentation, suggest the hypothesis that presence of antibodies may improve the quality and potency of protective SIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response.Approach 4: We have demonstrated that TRIM5alpha does not affect SIVmac251replication in vaccinated or unvaccinated Indian rhesus macaques. We determined the distribution of TRIM5alpha alleles by PCR and sequence analysis of the B30.2/SPRY domain in a cohort of eighty-two macaques. Our results demonstrated that TRIM5alpha genotype does not confound results of mucosal infection of rhesus macaques with SIVmac251.Approach 5: The ER-resident chaperone gp96, when released by cell lysis, induces an immunogenic chemokine signature and causes innate immune activation of DC and NK cells. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal immunization with a genetically engineered, secreted form of gp96, gp96-Ig chaperoning SIV antigens, induces high levels of antigen specific CD8 CTL in the rectal and vaginal mucosa of rhesus macaques. The frequency of SIV Gag- and SIV Tat-tetramer positive CD8 CTL in the intestinal mucosa reached 30-50% after the third immunization. Tetramer positive CD8 CTL expressed appropriate functional (granzyme B) and migration markers (CD103). The polyepitope specificity of the mucosal CD8 and CD4 response is evident from a strong, multifunctional cytokine response upon stimulation with peptides covering the gag, tat and env proteins. Induction of powerful mucosal effector CD8 CTL responses by cell-based gp96(SIV)-Ig immunization may provide a pathway to the development of safe and effective SIV/HIV vaccines.Approach 6: We tested the immunogenicity of a vaccine that uses human papillomavirus-based gene transfer vectors, also called pseudovirions (HPV PsVs), to deliver SIV genes to the vaginal epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that this vaccine platform induces gene expression in the genital tract in both cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. Intravaginal vaccination with HPV16, HPV45, and HPV58 PsVs delivering SIV Gag DNA, induced vaginal Gag-specific IgA, serum IgG, and T-cell responses in blood, vaginal mucosa, and draining lymph nodes that rapidly expanded following intravaginal exposure to SIVmac251.  HPV PsVs-based vehicles are immunogenic, warrant further testing as vaccine candidates for HIV. Approach 7: We show that a vaccine able to elicit strain-specific non-neutralizing antibodies to this region of gp120 is associated with control of highly pathogenic chimeric SHIV89.6P replication in rhesus macaques. The vaccinated animal that had the highest titers of antibodies to the amino terminus portion of V1, prior to challenge, had secondary antibody responses that mediated cell killing by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), as early as two weeks after infection and inhibited viral replication by antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI), by four weeks after infection. There was a significant inverse correlation between virus level and binding antibody titers to the envelope protein, (R = -0.83, p 0.015), and ADCVI (R = -0.84 p=0.044). These data suggest that anti-envelope antibodies with neutralizing and non-neutralizing FcgR-dependent activities may be important in the control of SHIV replication. Approach 8: The licensed smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, is a cell culture derivative of Dryvax. Both ACAM2000 and Dryvax are administered by skin scarification and can cause progressive vaccinia, with skin lesions that disseminate to distal sites. We have investigated the immunologic basis of the containment of vaccinia in the skin with the goal to identify safer vaccines for smallpox. Macaques were depleted systemically of T- or B-cells and vaccinated with either Dryvax or an attenuated vaccinia vaccine, LC16m8. B-cell depletion did not affect the size of skin lesions induced by either vaccine. However, while depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells had no adverse effects on LC16m8-vaccinated animals, it caused progressive vaccinia in macaques immunized with Dryvax. As both Dryvax and LC16m8 vaccines protect healthy macaques from a lethal monkeypox intravenous challenge, our data identifies LC16m8 as a safer and effective alternative to ACAM2000 and Dryvax vaccines for immune compromised individuals.',\n",
       " 'Summary: Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 180 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), there are 4.1 million persons who are anti-HCV positive, 3.2 million of whom have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2001, chronic liver disease was the 12th leading cause of death in the U.S. most due to chronic HCV infection. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to study. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infection is undergoing a paradigm change with the advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents. For genotype 1 infection response rates now approach 70-75%, close to that of genotypes 2 and 3. The challenging group of patients to treat are those who have failed a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin and those with advanced disease. Therapeutic options for these subjects are improving but few studies have been conducted in these patient populations. Thus studies using newer, safer and more effective therapies are urgently needed for these sub-populations with chronic HCV infection.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have created a large database of untreated patients with chronic HCV (n700) and have analyzed this database to identify factors that affect the natural history of chronic HCV infection. We have published 3 studies on this cohort, identifying clinical factors and candidate genes associated with fibrosis progression. To further define factors associated with fibrosis progression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C, we prospectively monitored a large, well characterized cohort of over 1000 patients who participated in a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of long-term peginterferon versus no therapy for patients with advanced HCV infection (HALT-C-see below) for 8 years. Important data describing the natural history of advanced chronic hepatitis C has been derived from this study. This included the observation that 31% of control patients developed a clinical outcome over 4 years. Liver-related death and/or liver transplantation were common outcomes in person who remained viremic. In contrast, patients who clear the virus had a significantly reduced rate of clinical outcomes. More recently, we have developed a prediction model which demonstrates that both the baseline value and the rapidity in change of the value of routine laboratory variables appear to be important in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C. We have also combined patients from the NIH and HALT-C cohorts to examine the role of IL-28b polymorphisms on fibrosis progression and clinical outcomes. Our preliminary data suggests no association of IL28b with fibrosis progression but we did observe a higher rate of clinical outcomes in patients with IL28b CC genotype.Finally, we are validating the usefulness of a new technology, ultrasound elastography (Fibroscan), to non-invasively assess hepatic fibrosis. Results revealed that the device has a 96% accuracy for prediction of cirrhosis. Studies are ongoing to compare Fibroscan and MRI elastography to liver biopsy, and plasma will be stored for future proteomic analysis. Our goal is to develop a series of blood and imaging test that will obviate the need for liver biopsy in most patients with chronic HCV infection.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Management options for non-responders to peginterferon and ribavirin are limited. Ribavirin, a guanosine nucleoside analogue is critically important for the success of therapy for CHC. Several post-hoc analyses and one pilot study have suggested that higher doses of ribavirin may be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. Accordingly, we have conducted an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose ribavirin in combination with standard dose peginterferon alfa-2a for non-responder and relapser patients with CHC. The results showed that 48% (10/21) patients achieved an end-of-treatment response and to date 15% (3/20) have successfully achieved long-term clearance of the virus. One subject is still in follow-up. Future studies are planned using novel, potent DAAs in this patient population.3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyThe conduct of clinical trials over the last 30 years has allowed the LDB to acquire invaluable clinical material (patient serum, liver tissue and lymphophocytes) to which state of the art laboratory techniques can be applied to address issues of the pathogenesis of HCV infection and the mechanisms of action of antiviral therapy. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is unknown. Error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis due to an increase in the viral mutation rate has been shown to be a possible mechanism of ribavirin in poliovirus, bovine diarrhea virus and GBV-B, viruses very similar to HCV. We have previously shown that ribavirin use is associated with an early, transient increase in the mutation rate of HCV but this effect was not observed at later time points. This suggests that lethal mutagenesis and error catastrophe is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of action of ribavirin during therapy for chronic HCV infection. Our plan is to extend this investigation, examining the effects of higher doses of ribavirin and the effects of the combination of ribavirin and interferon on viral mutation rate.',\n",
       " 'Models for the ultimate development of effective vaccines and immunotherapies that would limit HIV replication can be drawn from naturally occurring examples of immune system-mediated control. Identifying the components, targets, and magnitude of an effective immune response to HIV are important steps toward developing effective vaccines and immunotherapies. Although patients with normal CD4+ T cell counts and low levels of plasma virus are a heterogeneous group, a small subgroup of patients with truly non-progressive HIV infection and restriction of virus replication likely holds important clues to the basis of an effective immune response to HIV. A small subpopulation of HIV-infected individuals (fewer than 0.8%) shows no signs of disease progression over a 10-year period. We have assembled a stringently defined cohort of such patients, termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs), or elite controllers. Many of these patients have been infected for 20 years, yet even without receiving antiretroviral therapy, they have experienced no CD4+ T-cell decline and have maintained plasma viral RNA levels below 50 copies per milliliter. We are using cells from these patients to systematically dissect the mechanisms of immune-mediated restriction of virus replication. The HIV-specific T-cell responses of these patients have been studied in extreme detail. Through this project, considerable progress has been made in understanding how the immune system controls HIV. Our prior work indicated that there is a dramatic association between immunologic control and the HLA B*5701 allele, and that the immune response is highly focused on peptides restricted by this allele. This result established both host genetic and functional links between immunologic control and the CD8+ T-cell responses of these patients. More recently, we have found that this focus is specific to HIV and is not found in the response to other pathogens such as hepatitis C virus or cytomegalovirus. LTNPs and progressors do not differ in the frequency of HIV-specific T cells or in the ability to recognize the autologous virus. The finding of high frequencies of CD8+ T cells specific for the patients virus in both LTNPs and progressors strongly suggested that differences between responses of these patient groups were qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. One important qualitative difference in the HIV-specific immune response that distinguishes LTNPs from progressors is the maintenance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with a high proliferative capacity. This proliferation parallels perforin expression required for effective killing of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. We have previously established the properties of the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response that are tightly associated with the LTNP phenotype. Although the HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs have a greater capacity to proliferate and increase their number of molecules responsible for killing HIV-infected cells, the mechanism(s) by which these properties translate into effective immunologic control of HIV has remained unknown. Most current assays are not sufficiently powerful to establish if differences in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell function are determined by frequency, CD8+ T-cell proliferation, preferential target or effector cell death, or the mechanism of HIV-infected cell elimination. To better understand the mechanisms of immunologic control, we devised a method to measure HIV-infected cell elimination on a per-cell basis. Measured on a per-cell basis, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs efficiently eliminated primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. This effective killing was clearly distinguishable from the responses of progressors over a very broad range of effectors to HIV-infected targets. Progressor cells did not mediate effective killing even at high effector-to-target ratios. Defective cytotoxicity of progressor effectors could be restored in vitro. These results establish an effector function and a mechanism that clearly segregate with immunologic control of HIV.One of the original goals of our work in LTNP was to provide insights regarding important elements of the cellular immune response that should be induced in vaccination. Although cytotoxic capacity clearly distinguishes those with immunologic control in the setting of chronic infection, it may not necessarily be the operative mechanism in control induced by an HIV vaccine. Previously, direct measurements of recall cytotoxic capacity assessed by granzyme B target cell activity and infected CD4+ T-cell elimination had not been applied to recipients of HIV vaccines. We recently examined the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity of HIV-1-uninfected recipients of the Merck Ad5/HIV trivalent vaccine. A very high profile efficacy trial employing this vaccine was the Step study, a phase IIB test-of-concept trial involving 3,000 HIV-negative individuals at high risk of HIV infection. We observed that the ability of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8+ T cells to kill primary autologous HIV-infected targets was relatively low and not comparable to responses we have previously associated with immunologic control. We observed that the cytotoxic responses of vaccine recipients carrying HLA class I alleles associated with nonprogressive HIV infection, e.g., B*27, B*57 and B*58, were significantly greater than those of individuals not possessing these alleles. These findings suggest that the relatively poor ability of this vaccine to reduce viral loads upon natural infection is potentially attributable to the relatively poor induction of cytotoxic capacity.To better understand the qualitative features of effective HIV-specific immunity, in 2012 we examined the T cell receptor (TCR) clonal composition of CD8+ T-cells recognizing conserved HIV p24-derived epitopes in HLA-B*5701+ long-term nonprogressors / elite controllers and HLA-matched progressors. Both groups displayed oligoclonal HLA-B5701-restricted p24-specific CD8+ T cell responses with similar levels of diversity and few public clonotypes. Thus, HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in LTNP/EC are not differentiated from those of progressors on the basis of clonal diversity or TCR sharing. In 2012 we described four unique individuals who were distinct from conventional LTNP/EC in that they had extraordinarily low HIV burdens and comparatively weak immune responses. The four unique cases were distinguished from typical LTNP/EC based on weakly reactive Western blots, undetectable plasma viremia by a single copy assay, extremely low to undetectable HIV DNA levels and difficult to isolate replication-competent virus.  All four had at least one protective HLA allele and CD8+ T-cell responses that were disproportionately high for the low antigen levels, but comparatively lower than those of typical LTNP/EC.  These unique individuals exhibited extraordinary suppression over HIV replication and, therefore, higher-level control than has been demonstrated in previous studies of LTNP/EC.  Additional insight into the full spectrum of immune-mediated suppression over HIV replication may enhance our understanding of the associated mechanisms, which should inform the design of efficacious HIV vaccines and immunotherapies.Taken together our work suggests that cytotoxic capacity is a clear correlate of immunologic control of HIV in chronic infection and may also be an important immune correlate in vaccinees. In addition, the greater cytotoxic capacity induced in vaccine trials among participants with protective alleles is consistent with associations between MHC alleles and viral load in vaccinees. Over the coming years we are optimistic that this work will provide a long-sought after T cell correlate of immunity that will accelerate vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually.  A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to achieve these goals were performed this year.Obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for severe or fatal infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza, but was not previously recognized for previous pandemic or seasonal influenza infections.  Our aim was to evaluate the role of obesity as an independent risk factor for severity of infection with 2009 pH1N1, seasonal H1N1, or a pathogenic H1N1 influenza virus.  Diet-induced obese (DIO) and their non-obese, age-matched control counterparts were inoculated with a 2009 pH1N1 influenza virus, a seasonal H1N1 virus, or a classical swine H1N1 virus.  DIO mice had higher mortality (80%) than control mice (0%) and lost more weight during pH1N1 infection. No effect of obesity on morbidity and mortality was observed during seasonal or or swine influenza infections. Influenza antigen distribution in the alveolar regions of the lungs was more pronounced in DIO than control mice during pH1N1 infection and localized interferon-&#946; and proinflammatory cytokine protein responses in the lungs were significantly lower in DIO than control mice. Conversely, serum cytokine concentrations were elevated in DIO, but not control mice following infection with CA/09. The effect of obesity on differential immune responses was abrogated during seasonal or swine H1N1 infection. Together, these data support epidemiologic reports of obesity as a risk factor for severe 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection.The 1918 influenza pandemic caused 50 million deaths worldwide. Understanding the origin, virulence, and pathogenic properties of the 1918 virus, is crucial for current public health preparedness and future pandemic planning. The origin of the 1918 pandemic virus has not been resolved, but its coding sequences are very like those of avian influenza virus. The proteins encoded by the 1918 virus differ from typical low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses at only a small number of amino acids in each open reading frame. To study this, a series of chimeric 1918 influenza viruses were created in which each of the eight 1918 pandemic virus gene segments was replaced individually with the corresponding gene segment of a prototypical low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H1N1 virus in order to investigate functional compatibility of the 1918 virus genome with gene segments from an LPAI virus and to identify gene segments and mutations important for mammalian adaptation. This set of eight  7:1  chimeric viruses was compared to the parental 1918 and LPAI H1N1 viruses in intranasally infected mice. Seven of the 1918 LPAI 7:1 chimeric viruses replicated and caused disease equivalent to the fully reconstructed 1918 virus. Only the chimeric 1918 virus containing the avian influenza PB2 gene segment was attenuated in mice. This attenuation could be corrected by the single E627K amino acid change, further confirming the importance of this change in mammalian adaptation and mouse pathogenicity. While the mechanisms of influenza virus host switch, and particularly mammalian host adaptation are still only partly understood, these data suggest that the 1918 virus, whatever its origin, is very similar to avian influenza virus.Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza shares the same neuraminidase (NA) subtype with the 2009 pandemic H1N1, and cross-reactive NA immunity might protect against or mitigate lethal H5N1 infection. To evaluate this, mice were either infected with a sublethal dose of 2009 pandemic H1N1 or were vaccinated and boosted with virus-like particles (VLP) consisting of the NA and matrix proteins, standardized by NA activity and administered intranasally, and were then challenged with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Mice previously infected with 2009 H1N1 survived H5N1 challenge with no detectable virus or respiratory tract pathology on day 4. Mice immunized with H5N1 or H1N1 NA VLPs were also fully protected from death, with a 100-fold and 10-fold reduction in infectious virus, respectively, and reduced pathology in the lungs. Human influenza vaccines that elicit not only HA, but also NA immunity may provide enhanced protection against the emergence of seasonal and pandemic viruses.Influenza A virus infection leads to variable and imperfectly understood pathogenicity. We reported that segment 3 of the virus contains a second open reading frame ( X-ORF ), accessed via ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift product, termed PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF and functions to repress cellular gene expression. PA-X also modulates IAV virulence in a mouse infection model, acting to decrease pathogenicity. Loss of PA-X expression leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response, which notably includes increases in inflammatory, apoptotic, and T lymphocyte-signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown IAV protein that modulates the host response to infection, a finding with important implications for understanding IAV pathogenesis.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne dengue (DEN) viruses, members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. A single polypeptide is co-translationally processed by viral and cellular proteases generating three structural proteins (C, M, and E) and at least seven non-structural proteins. The genome organization of the DEN viruses is 5-UTR-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-UTR-3 (UTR  untranslated region, C  capsid, prM  membrane precursor, E  envelope, NS  nonstructural). There are four dengue virus serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and DEN4) that circulate in tropical and subtropical regions of the world inhabited by more than 2.5 billion people. Annually, there are an estimated 50-100 million dengue infections and hundreds of thousands of cases of the more severe and potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) with children bearing much of the disease burden. DEN viruses are endemic in at least 100 countries and cause more human disease than any other mosquito-borne virus. In at least eight Asian countries, the DEN viruses are a leading cause of hospitalization and death in children. Unfortunately, many countries affected by DEN viruses have very limited financial resources for healthcare, and the economic burden of DEN disease is considerable. As such, an economical vaccine that prevents disease caused by the DEN viruses is a global public health priority.The cost-effectiveness, safety, long-term immunity, and efficacy associated with the live attenuated vaccine against yellow fever virus, another mosquito-borne flavivirus, serves as a model for the feasibility of a live attenuated DEN virus vaccine. However, the development of a live attenuated dengue vaccine has been complicated by several factors. First, it has been difficult to develop monovalent vaccines against each of the four serotypes that exhibit a satisfactory balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. Second, an effective live attenuated dengue virus vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation of components representing each serotype because multiple serotypes typically co-circulate in a region, each DEN serotype is capable of causing disease, and the introduction of additional serotypes is common. In addition, the association of increased disease severity (DHF/DSS) in previously infected persons undergoing an infection by a different dengue serotype necessitates a vaccine that will confer long-term protection against all four serotypes. Third, it has been difficult for developers to formulate a tetravalent vaccine with low reactogenicity that induces a broad neutralizing antibody response against each DEN serotype. Fourth, a dengue vaccine must be produced economically so that it can be made available to populations that need it most.  We have tried to address these issues as part of a program to generate a live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine. Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials.  During the past year, a replacement lot for our DEN3del30/31 vaccine candidate was manufactured and released for use.  To date, tetravalent mixtures have been successfully tested in over 180 human subjects.Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of vital functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes,  preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, help with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the AsiaPacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually.  The high fatality rate and frequent residual neuro-psychiatric sequelae in survivors make JEV infection a considerable health problem. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory previously recovered these engineered viruses and evaluated their pathogenicity in mice.  The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and thus provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations. Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA-14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes.  A number of the rJEV/DEN4 chimeric viruses based on the DEN4del30 background have also been generated and are awaiting evaluation in mice.  Unfortunately, we have been without an BSL3 select agent animal facility since July 2011 and hope to soon be able to return to the facility to complete our studies.',\n",
       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flavivirus genus that has a global impact on public heath due to its widespread distribution and the ability to cause severe disease in humans. Each year, 50-100 million individuals are infected by DENV, with clinical manifestations ranging from a self-limiting acute febrile illness (dengue fever) to a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF). Four related serotypes of DENV circulate in nature, each capable of causing the full spectrum of DENV-related disease.  Prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrate that sequential infection with two DENV serotypes is associated with a more severe disease course.  The number of DHF cases reported has increased dramatically during the past twenty years, and now exceeds 250,000 cases annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV.Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in protection against flavivirus infection. Antibodies have been mapped to all three structural domains of the E protein (DI-DIII) that exhibit varying degrees of neutralization potency and confer protection by multiple effector mechanisms. Eliciting neutralizing antibody is a major goal of vaccine development. Complicating these efforts is a requirement for vaccines to simultaneously elicit protection against four different viruses that while antigenically related, share only some of the antibody-binding determinants thought to contribute to virus neutralization. Thus, antibodies raised against one serotype of DENV may react with virions of another serotype, but often with reduced affinity and functional potency.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of severe DENV cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE.The development of a protective tetravalent response is complicated by the possibility that all four components of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may not be equally immunogenic in the vaccinee. Interference and uneven levels of infectivity among DENV strains in this context has been reported. Understanding the immunogenicity of each component of a tetravalent vaccine is an important aspect of vaccine development and identifying appropriate correlates of protection, particularly because it is presently unclear how many serotype-specific responses will be required for protection from all four serotypes of DENV. However, dissecting the specific contribution of each element of a tetravalent vaccine is technically challenging due to the presence of antibodies that bind cross-reactive determinants shared by different components of the vaccine. A detailed map of the functionally important type-specific and group-reactive epitopes on the E protein is not presently available. Improved methodology that distinguishes and quantifies the functional contribution of each component of a tetravalent vaccine would allow for improvements in estimates of vaccine immunogenicity, for a more precise correlate of protection, and for a powerful investigational tool to study vaccine success and failure.To that end, we propose to develop a novel approach to measure the functional contributions of serotype-specific antibodies against the backdrop of a highly cross-reactive tetravalent polyclonal response. A panel of reporter virus particles (RVPs) containing mutations that destroy antibody-binding determinants will be used to identify functionally important epitopes that elicit type-specific or cross-reactive antibodies present in the serum of DENV vaccinees. An iterative screening process will guide selection of RVPs that are either no longer sensitive to neutralization by cross-reactive antibodies or type-specific responses. RVPs with these characteristics provide two complementary and specific methods for detecting type-specific responses in polyclonal sera.  These tools will then be employed to characterize the epitopes that comprise the neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated or naturally infected humans.',\n",
       " \"The LID entered into a CRADA with MedImmune in 2006 to develop live attenuated vaccines against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and human parainfluena viruses (HPIV) serotypes 1, 2, and 3. This CRADA remains in place. These vaccines are intended for intranasal administration to infants and young children. The first priority is to develop a bivalent vaccine against the predominant RSV subgroup, called subgroup A (RSV-A), and HPIV3, the two more prevalent and important viruses in this group. Secondary objectives are to develop live-attenuated vaccines against HMPV, HPIV1, and HPIV2. RSV RSV-A may provide sufficient cross-protection against RSV-B, which is the second subgroup of RSV, or it may be necessary to develop an RSV-B vaccine component.Vaccine virus candidates are generated from cDNA by reverse genetics, providing well-defined vaccines. Stepwise clinical evaluation begins in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), followed by seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age), followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -59 months of age, depending on the virus). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses are evaluated further in young infants, typically 1-3 months of age. The following is a summary of ongoing studies.RSV-A vaccine: Under the CRADA, Medimmune is conducting a Phase 1/2a immunogenicity study in young infants with a recombinant rRSV (MEDI-559) that was developed by LID and contains a set of five independent attenuating elements. In a previous phase 1 study by LID, an earlier version of this virus (that differs by 27 silent mutations and appears to be phenotypically indistinguishable) was well-tolerated and immunogenic in 1-2 month old infants. The purpose of the present study is to get further data on safety and immunogenicity. LID has initiated a clinical study of a live attenuated RSV bearing deletion of the M2-2 coding sequence (delM2-2). This virus exhibits up-regulated viral gene expression that may increase its immunogenicity. In an accompanying report, we describe the development of a version of MEDI-559 that has been modified to increase its genetic and phenotypic stability. This virus, called cps2, is being manufactured as clinical trial material for phase I studies. Other candidates are in pre-clinical development and will be described next year.RSV-B vaccine: We developed a reverse genetics system for RSV-B that can be used to develop vaccine candidates based on results of ongoing studies with RSV-A.HPIV3 vaccine: One strategy towards an HPIV3 vaccine has been to use reverse genetics to construct chimeric viruses that contain genes from both HPIV3 and bovine PIV3 (BPIV3). The LID previously showed that BPIV3 is attenuated and well-tolerated in non-human primates and seronegative children, and that the determinants of this host range restriction are polygenic and appear to be stable. The strategy in making chimeras of HPIV3 and BPIV3 is to combine the host range restriction phenotype of BPIV3 with the F and HN neutralization and major protective antigens of HPIV3. Two chimeras have been under clinical evaluation. The first is rB/HPIV3, which consists of the BPIV3 backbone in which the F and HN protective antigen genes have been replaced by those of HPIV3. The second chimera is rHPIV3-Nb, which consists of the HPIV3 backbone in which the N gene has been replaced by that of BPIV3. These two viruses have been evaluated in adults, HPIV3-seropositive children, and HPIV3-seronegative children >6 months of age.  Both viruses were highly restricted in adults and seropositive children but readily infected seronegative children. The mean peak titers of shed virus for rB/HPIV3 and rHPIV3-Nb were 102.8 and 103.7 PFU/ml, respectively. Although rB/HPIV3 was thus more restricted in replication, it induced significantly higher serum antibody titers specific to HPIV3. These data suggest that the rB/HPIV3 vaccine is more attenuated and yet more immunogenic, and thus may be the preferred vaccine for further clinical development. The basis for the difference in the two viruses is unknown. As one possibility, the viral interferon antagonists in rB/HPIV3 are of bovine origin and may be less effective in inhibiting the interferon response in human cells, which in turn may have an adjuvant effect. A second strategy towards an HPIV3 vaccine is based on an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that previously had been shown by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons, and the attenuating mutations were identified as described in previous reports. The vaccine is being evaluated in a 2-dose, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in HPIV3-seronegative children of 6-36 months of age. The two doses are spaced at a 6-month interval. This is designed to evaluate the durability of immunity in this population and to identify appropriate dosing intervals.  This is being evaluated in companion protocols through Seattle Children's Hospital and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. A total of 40 children have been enrolled. HPIV1 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that is attenuated by defined mutations including ones that have been engineered for genetic stability. This virus was immunogenic and protective in African green monkeys (AGMs). When given to 35 unscreened healthy adult volunteers, only 4 individuals were infected and shedding was minimal and with no illness, which is the desired safety profile for an attenuated virus. When evaluated in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (double-blind, 10 vaccine recipients and 5 placebo), none of the vaccinees were detectably infected, consistent with a highly attenuated nature. The vaccine presently is being evaluated in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (N = 30, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). Results are incomplete but indicate that vaccine virus infectivity and shedding were low. Thus, this virus may be over-attenuated, which may be corrected by removing one attenuating mutation.HPIV2 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated intranasal HPIV2 vaccine called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that, like the HPIV1 candidate, included stabilized mutations. This virus was immunogenic and protective in AGMs. When given to 15 seropositive adult volunteers, only 4 were infected and vaccine virus was shed in minimal amounts. The virus is presently being evaluated in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (N = 15, with a vaccine to placebo ratio of 2:1). HMPV vaccine: LID evaluated a recombinant version of wild-type HMPV for infectivity and pathogenicity in adults. The virus was infectious but caused minimal disease, as would be expected in this seropositive population. This showed that the recombinant backbone was suitable as the foundation for developing live-attenuated derivatives. LID initiated the first HMPV vaccine clinical study. This involves a live-attenuated HMPV vaccine virus (rHMPV-Pa) in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. This virus was administered successively to healthy adults and seropositive children >12 months of age, with the result that there was no detectable HMPV infection or shedding, consistent with this being a highly attenuated virus. The vaccine is presently being evaluated in seronegative children >6 months of age.\",\n",
       " 'An experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease is critical for the study of human AIDS. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. The purpose of this project is to investigate host and viral factors involved in variable disease progression in SIV-infected macaques and the lack of disease in African primates infected with their own strains of SIV.PATHOGENESIS OF SIVsm-INFECTION OF MACAQUES&#8232;To investigate the role of host factors in SIV-infection of macaques, we used a well-defined molecularly cloned virus (SIVsmE543-3), two macaque passages from the original sooty mangabey host. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that PBMC of individual macaques show vastly different susceptibility to SIVsmE543-3 infection in vitro and susceptibility is predictive of subsequent plasma viremia following inoculation. Our recent studies have now identified that allelic polymorphisms in the SPRY domain of TRIM5 alpha gene are responsible for much of this variation. In contrast, SIVmac which has been passaged in macaques multiple times appears to be adapted for resistance to multiple alleles of rhesus macaque TRIM5. We evaluated the effect of restrictive TRIM5 alleles (TRIM-TFP and TRIM-CypA) on viremia in a cohort of 43 rhesus SIVsmE543-3-infected rhesus macaques. The restrictive genotypes were associated with significantly lower viremia than observed in macaques with the permissive genotype, as well as emergence of escape mutations in the SIV capsid protein. The specific amino acid substitutions found in viruses that escaped from TRIM5 restriction were introduced into an E543-3 background in an effort to generate more reproducible viremia. These substitutions confer resistance to TRIM5 restriction by previously restrictive alleles in a single cycle assay and greater replication ability in primary PBMC of macaques homozygous for the resistant allele. We are currently evaluating the in vivo replication of this variant in TRIM-restrictive macaques.   Preliminary studies show significantly higher peak plasma viremia This difference in susceptibility to TRIM5 polymorphism between SIVsm and SIVmac may explain the greater degree of protection achieved in immunized macaques challenged with repeated low dose intrarectal challenges with SIVsmE660 versus SIVmac251.&#8232;&#8232;Full length infectious clones of the related challenge stock, SIVsmE660 have also been generated by close to full length RT-PCR from the virus stock. Three of these viruses replicate efficiently in rhesus PBMC in vitro and very sensitive to neutralizing antibody (equivalent to Tier 1 classification used for HIV-1. All three are sensitive to the TRIM-TFP allele but two have mutations in the cyclophylin A binding loop that confer resistance to TRIM-CypA. Two clones were evaluated for in vivo viral replication and pathogenesis in TRIM-TFP/Q expressing rhesus macaques following intravenous inoculation. Both clones resulted in robust and persistent viremia that was associated with significant loss of CD4+ memory T cells. Evolution of the V1 and V4 regions was associated with escape from neutralization.   Later stage variants had become more resistant to neutralizing antibody and might provide a virus that could be used in subsequent vaccine studies.  A variant virus expressing this envelope has been generated and will be evaluated in macaques as a potential challenge strain.  In addition, mutations associated with escape from TRIM-TFP have been introduced into one of the original clones and this will be evaluated in macaques in vivo.SIV NEUROPATHOGENESIS. SIV and HIV are both associated with the development of encephalitis. For HIV, the onset of AIDS dementia is generally a late stage finding. In contrast, most models of SIV encephalitis (SIVE) use animals that progress rapidly to disease and for that reason use pigtail macaques. We observed a small number of rhesus that developed SIVE over a more protracted course. The evolution of SIV in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was compared with the virus that evolved in the plasma of two rhesus macaques that developed SIVE. While the virus in the CSF and plasma were similar during primary infection, distinct substitutions were observed sequentially in the two compartments and terminal virus from the brain and plasma were phylogenetically distinct. These findings are consistent with compartmentalization between the brain and blood during development of neuro-AIDS and the evolution of viruses with distinct genotypes and potentially distinct biological phenotypes in the brain. One of these isolates, SIVsmH631Br induced SIVE in one of four macaques; virus isolated from the brain off this animal (SIVsmH783Br) induced SIVE or meningitis in 4 of the 6 animals. Evolution of virus in the brain, CSF, blood and lymphoid tissues was evaluated using single genome amplification of selected samples and demonstrated compartmentalization of virus in the brain and CSF as compared to blood and plasma. An additional passage of virus (SIVsmH804E) has been inoculated into four rhesus and preliminary results show high plasma viremia and moderate CSF viremia. Studies are underway to study the molecular features of virus in the parenchyma and meninges using laser capture microdissection (LCM). Full-length infectious clones representative of this virus will be generated. &#8232;ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION OF NATURAL HOST SPECIES. A second goal of this project is to study the mechanisms underlying the lack of pathogenicity of SIV for their natural host species, with emphasis on SIVagm from vervet monkeys. SIVagm is capable of inducing AIDS in PT macaques but African green monkeys (AGM) do not develop overt signs of disease following infection. We previously perturbed the development of adaptive immune responses by combined administration of anti-CD8 and CD20 antibodies during primary infection of PTM, and AGM and compared these animals to historical controls infected with the same virus. These data suggest that adaptive immune responses are critical in pathogenic SIV infection in PTM. However, the maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms including non-adaptive immune mechanisms. &#8232;&#8232;In a collaboration with Jason Brenchley, we found that many of the CD4+ T cells from African green monkeys down-regulate CD4 in vivo as they enter the memory pool and that this occurs independent of SIV infection. These CD4-negative memory T cells maintain functions that are normally attributed to CD4 T cells including production of IL-2, production of IL-17, expression of FoxP3 and expression of CD40L; however lack of CD4 expression apparently protects these activated cells from infection by SIVagm in vivo. Thus the absence of SIV-induced disease progression in natural hosts species may be partially explained by preservation of a subset of T cells that maintain CD4 T cell function while being resistant to SIV-infection in vivo. We also observed that infant AGM have very few memory CD4+ T cells which might make them more resistant to SIV infection.  Therefore we have been conducting small-scale breeding of SIVagm-infected AGM using pair housing; this has been successful with the production of 14 infants over a five year period. None of these infants became infected despite being nursed by their infected mothers for a year following birth. We have therefore initiated studies of SIVagm infection in infant AGM.',\n",
       " '1)  Further understanding of the role of Treg during chronic infection has been limited by our lack of knowledge regarding the stimuli that drive Treg activation and expansion in these situations. Not only are pathogen-derived antigens continuously presented during chronic infection but tissue damage may also result in the presentation of self-antigens.Two strains of LCMV are commonly used, the parental strain Armstrong and the variant Clone 13. LCMV Armstrong and Clone 13 differ by only two amino acids, neither of which has been associated with either CD4 or CD8 T cell epitopes. LCMV Armstrong causes an acute infection in normal mice in which the animal develops few, in any, symptoms and is self-limiting 6-8 days post infection (DPI). Mice that clear LCMV Armstrong infection also go on to develop life-long protective immunity from reinfection. In contrast, Clone 13 infection results in a chronic infection in which mice remain infected virtually for life. While both infections result in a long-lived pool of virus-specific T cells, those cells generated following Armstrong infection maintain all of the properties of memory T cells. In contrast, virus-specific T cells in mice infected with LCMV Clone 13 require the persistence of antigen to be maintained and they lose the ability to perform effector function (functional exhaustion). LCMV Armstrong infection is similar to many acute viral infections including influenza, and Clone 13 infection is similar to HIV and chronic hepatitis (particularly hepatitis C) both in terms of viral persistence and the down-regulation of the virus-specific immune response following infection. We have identified a subpopulation of Treg that rapidly and specifically expand early during chronic but not acute infection. The expanded Treg are restricted to cells expressing particular TCR V&#946; segments (V&#946;5 in C57BL/6 mice and V&#946;5 and 12 in BALB/c mice). Interestingly, the V&#946;-specific T cell expansion was restricted only to Treg and not Foxp3- Teff cells expressing the same V&#946; segments, suggesting that the process is Treg-specific. The expanded Tregs were derived from a pre-existing population of Treg and not derived de novo during the infection. By using congenic mice that lack all endogenous Mtv proviruses (Mtv/null), we have shown that the expansion of V&#946;-specific Treg during chronic LCMV infection is secondary to Mtv-superantigen (Sag)- encoded in the mouse genome. The mechanism by which chronic LCMV infection results in Mtv-Sag-dependent Treg activation seems to depend and require presentation of the endogenous SAg by DC. Taken together, these studies define a unique mechanism of Treg activation and expansion following chronic viral infection.We have addressed whether the innate inflammatory signals required for peptide antigen-specific effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cellactivation are similarly required for Sag-mediated expansion of Treg following chronic LCMV infection. Our studies demonstrate that Sag-mediated Treg expansion requires intrinsic IFN-alpha/betaR signaling similar to effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Unlike the effector T cell responses, Sag-specific Treg expansion does not require intrinsic MyD88 signaling, however MyD88-dependent CD8+ T cell activation itself is required. Thus, Treg expansion in this well-characterized model of chronic viral infection in response to Sag requires two major components  signaling via the IFN-alpha/betaR  and activation of anti-viral specific CD8+ T cells. These findings shed further light on the similarities and differences between the specific requirements for Treg versus effector T cell activation. It remains unclear whether IFN&#61537;/&#61538;R signaling is important in other Treg functions. It is clear in our experiments that IFN-alpha/betaR  signaling alone, even in the context of a high viral load, is not sufficient to drive the expansion of Vbeta5+ Treg, as LCMV congenital carriers have an intact innate immune response, and have high serum levels of IFN-beta, but do not manifest eSag-induced Treg expansion.The mechanisms by which anti-viral specific CD8+ T cells mediate Treg expansion in this model remain unknown. It remains possible that CD8+ T cells or their products play a critical role for the enhanced expression of Sag on DC, which are required for Treg expansion. While it has not been possible to demonstrate a role for Treg in promoting CD8+ T cells exhaustion in chronic LCMV infection, depletion of Tregs in a model of chronic Friend virus infection led to the partial recovery of the exhausted CD8+ T cell phenotype and lower viral titers. Nonetheless, there appears to be a yin-yang relationship between Tregs and anti-viral CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells may expand Tregs to inhibit immunopathology, but overexpansion of Tregs may directly or indirectly promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Lastly, while the biologic significance of Sag mediated expansion of Tregs remains to be determined, endogenous retroviral sequences make up a significant percentage of both the human and mouse genome and activation of endogenous retroviral gene expression may play multiple roles in both the development and the function of the mature immune system.  2). We have also begun to explore the potential role of Mtv infection on other aspects of immune responses and have focused our studies on NK T cells and innate CD8+ T cells. Innate-like or memory-like CD8+ T cells have been characterized based on their increased expression of the phenotypic surface makers of memory cells (CD44 and CD122), increased expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes), and increased production of IFN-&#947; upon stimulation. Such innate CD8+ T cells were initially identified in ITK-/- mice and proposed to develop secondary to an increased TCR signaling threshold. This innate phenotype among CD8+ thymocytes was subsequently described in a number of other knockout and mutant mouse models. These studies concluded that this phenotype resulted from a cell-extrinsic factor, the overproduction of IL-4 by promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF)+ thymic NKT cells. Innate CD8+ T cells were present in BALB/c, but not in C57BL/6 mice. Following an extensive comparison of the phenotype of BALB/c and BALB/Mtv-null mice, we noted only one major difference. Innate CD8+ T cells were not present in the thymus of Mtv-null mice. Thymic &#945;&#946;+ iNKT cells from BALB/c mice had increased expression of PLZF in iNKT cells compared to BALB/Mtv-null mice. This increased PLZF expression in BALB/c coincided with a higher percentage of iNKT cells exhibiting a phenotype consistent with that of Stage 1 and Stage 2 iNKT cells, which are capable of producing higher levels of IL-4. In the absence of endogenous Mtv, the majority of thymic TCR &#945;&#946;+ iNKT cells within BALB/Mtv-null mice exhibited a phenotype that resembled that of Stage 3 iNKT cells, exhibiting  increased expression of T-bet, CD122 and IFN-&#947;. One potential candidate proviral gene that may influence iNKT development is Rem, an Mtv-encoded protein resulting from a doubly spliced mRNA within the env gene. Rem has been demonstrated to show functional homology to other RNA-binding nuclear export proteins of endogenous human retroviruses, including Rec (HERV-K), Rev (HIV), and Rex (HTLV). Rec physically interacts with the transcriptional repressor PLZF and PLZF-related proteins. The interaction between Rec and PLZF released the transcriptional repression of certain PLZF-repressed genes.  One such gene was c-myc, which has previously been shown to dramatically and specifically influence iNKT cell development.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to preventive HIV vaccines conducted by the VRC Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center. These consist of a screening protocol and clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines including: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. A brief summary of each study to date follows.The screening protocol, VRC 000 (02-I-0127), facilitates recruitment and screening of healthy, HIV-negative subjects for investigational preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials. Educational materials on vaccines are reviewed with and provided to subjects before enrollment into a study.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5): p. 601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published Vaccine, 2007. 25(20): p. 4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) was a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed.   VRC 009 (05-I-0081) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLOS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p. 1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) was a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed.  The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 016 (11-I-0197) is a Phase Ib descriptive study to evaluate the kinetics and pattern of early innate and adaptive immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, alone and after priming with DNA vaccine.  This study was developed and initiated in FY11 and remains ongoing during FY12.  HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase 2b efficacy study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed in collaboration with the Division of AIDS and HVTN. It is designed to see whether or not the vaccines have efficacy in prevention of HIV or an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who acquire HIV infection during 2 years of follow-up. This study is projected to be ongoing through 2014.',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): The objectives of this project are to 1) Characterize unknown and poorly described pathogens (primarily viruses and viroids) and diseases highly significant to the USDA plant germplasm quarantine program; 2) Develop and transfer sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective methods to clientele for the rapid detection of virus and virus-like pathogens of quarantine significance; and 3) Develop and transfer methods to clientele for the therapeutic elimination of virus and virus-like pathogens from infected plant genetic resources. The objectives focus on characterizing quarantine pathogens and determining the causal agents responsible for diseases that could threaten U.S. agriculture and ecosystems, and developing tools to effectively detect and eliminate them. The research areas are developed in consultation with USDA-APHIS and the data, protocols, and tools developed by this project are shared with them. Because problems that require immediate investigation can arise rapidly in the plant quarantine system, this project will remain flexible to allocate resources to new or emerging quarantine problems as warranted.  Approach: Conduct laboratory and greenhouse research to identify new methodologies and protocols for diagnostic testing of quarantined plant germplasm, with emphasis on highly sensitive molecular techniques that can shorten the duration time that material is held in quarantine and increase the reliability of indexing programs.  Determine the etiology of poorly described quarantine diseases using a wide range of greenhouse and laboratory techniques.  Conduct molecular characterization studies of quarantine pathogens and investigate their genetic diversity in order to refine and optimize testing methods. Develop protocols for the in vitro cultivation of prohibited genera germplasm and the therapeutic elimination of quarantine pathogens, thereby ensuring that valuable and sometimes unique and endangered germplasm is available for safeguarding and utilization. Transfer research data, protocols, and products to USDA-APHIS for incorporation into testing programs and to support science-based regulatory decisions.',\n",
       " 'This CC-NIE Integration project performed at the Louisiana State University is developing a cyber-infrastructure integrating six different large scale scientific research groups with high performance computing (HPC) clusters at LSU using software defined network technology and Hadoop and MPI (Message Passing Interface) based parallel frameworks. The project consists of three objectives: (i) Building 10Gbps software-defined network (SDN) with OpenFlow switches and controllers to provide multiple virtual network slices to each group; (ii) Transferring Big Data with automatically tuned operation through multiple optical paths over the SDN network achieving at most 20Gbps of aggregated disk-to-disk transfer rate; and (iii) Analyzing Big Data by developing data-intensive distributed computing frameworks with Hadoop and MPI technologies parallelizing large number of jobs over HPC clusters. Those three components are integrated with a web portal service and a GENI-enabled network management system. To achieve high disk-to-disk transfer rate at 20Gbps, the project has an industrial partnership with Samsung Electronics that contributes 70TB Solid State Drive (SSD) storage and optimizes the I/O bandwidth. The cyber-infrastructure accelerates the current Big Data research projects spanning a wide range of research areas including gene sequencing research at Biology and Vet School, computational chemistry, big data mining at Computer Science, coastal hazard simulation research at civil and environmental engineering. In the end, the project will establish a methodology to build integrated cyber-infrastructures consisting of high speed networks, high performance computing, and high speed storage for the Big Data Science and Engineering.',\n",

       " 'Ensuring the cyber-security of the smart grid raises significant interest amongst both general public and researchers. However, the corresponding education programs fall behind in many aspects. Very limited curriculum or hands-on learning resources are available for security education about the smart grid, especially for the mutual impacts between cyber and physical systems. To bridge this gap, this project is developing an integrated simulation environment dedicated to smart grid education programs, and is designing a suite of course modules and hands-on projects focusing on security of modern power systems. Through federating the control network simulator with the Power Grid Simulator Program, this project covers both cyber and physical systems underpinning smart grid operations. The research team is carrying out well-planned evaluation and dissemination activities to assess the effectiveness of the innovative instructional materials and promote their wide adoption. Rigorous evaluation procedures are being used by experienced independent evaluators.

       " \"0943424KarimIntellectual Merit: This EAGER proposal is a high risk high gain proposal. Recent outbreak of H1N1 flu and the worldwide spread of H5N1 avian influenza virus and its infection to human beings has raised a global concern about these viruses to cause a pandemic. According to the World Health Organization report of May 20, 2009, 41 countries have confirmed 10,243 cases of H1N1 flu with 80 fatalities. In the US, these numbers are 5,469 and 6, respectively. A treatment or a rapid vaccination process for H1N1 and H5N1 is urgently needed. The proposal addresses this issue in this transformative idea to develop a peptide-based membrane system so that flu viruses can be captured from either a cell culture broth or from human blood. The main goal is to develop a cell culture-based vaccine production method, which uses a peptide-based purification step. The peptide is developed using the available genomic information regarding hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of flu viruses. We hypothesize that for a given virus, an affinity peptide with a high specificity could be selected by using a screening tool. Moreover, with the chemical attachment of the affinity peptide group to a membrane surface, this affinity matrix could be used to repeatedly bind and elute the specific type of virus. We further hypothesize that the virus surface protein plays a significant role on the virus binding process. Therefore, an affinity membrane designed based on a specific strain of influenza virus may be used to bind other viruses which have high homogeneity to this virus. This research will be helpful in better understanding the role of the virus surface protein on the affinity binding process. A term of ''homogeneity'' is usually used to describe how similar two influenza virus strains are. By choosing several influenza viruses with different homogeneity, the effect of the surface protein on the virus binding to an affinity membrane could be characterized. This research will answer the question regarding how sensitive the effect of the homogeneity is on the binding of a virus to a given affinity membrane.Since microporous affinity membrane combines both the advantages of the microfiltration and resin based affinity chromatography, the virus production and purification process could be significantly simplified. This is specifically suitable for the cell culture based influenza virus vaccine production process. By carefully choosing an appropriate membrane pore size, cells removal and virus purification could be achieved within one step. Cell cultures will be flown through one side of a microporous affinity membrane. During this period, cells and cell debris will be rejected by the membrane pores while viruses and proteins and/or DNA and other small biological components will migrate inside the membrane pores. Viruses will then be specifically bound by these functional peptide groups grafted on the membrane pore surface while protein, DNA and other biological components will pass through the membrane pores. After washing, viruses with high purity can be eluted from the bounded membranes. This simplification of the purification process may speed up the H1N1 and H5N1 vaccine development, commercialization and production process.Broader Impact: Completion of the proposed studies will have significant impact and possible applications in H1N1 and H5H1 flu intervention. The proposed new peptide-based membrane will simplify the virus purification process and it may speed up the vaccine development, commercialization and production process. The prepared membrane may also be used in the virus diagnosis by quick collection and purification of virus samples. Further, this method may be extended to diagnose other viruses, such as the West Nile virus. Further, a possible clinical device may be developed which can specifically remove viruses from human blood. By circulating human blood through a membrane device containing affinity membranes for a specific flu virus, these viruses can be made to bind to the membrane surfaces thus reducing the overall virus population in the blood; this device may be then combined with some other intervention methods such as using TAMIFLU. This project will involve multidisciplinary researchers from Chemical Engineering and TTU Health Sciences Center. One of the educational goals of the project is to train one post-doc and one PhD student in the cutting edge research of vaccine and peptide-based membrane technology. An undergraduate student will be selected from well publicized outreach programs at TTU, e.g. Engineering Outreach Center, and McNair Scholars Program.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this proposal is to provide proof of concept evidence that a newly-developed prototype laser system can result in dose-sparing of existing influenza (flu) vaccines without any additives. Flu continues to be a significant public health problem and is responsible for up to 3~5 million cases of severe disease and 500,000 deaths a year worldwide. It costs more than 4 billion dollars a year in the US alone. Annual vaccination still remains one of the most cost-effective means to prevent the spread of the virus and decrease flu-caused morbidity and mortality, which, however, creates a huge burden economically, clinically and manufacturally. That is because time of a new vaccine matching the antigen alteration in the circulating virus is relatively short and yet the vaccine demand is massive and continuously increasing drastically every year, in particular, during an outbreak of a new strain or pandemic of flu virus. Vaccine adjuvant can significantly reduce vaccine doses or dosages, reducing the cost enormously. Unfortunately, aluminum-based adjuvant, the only FDA-approved, widely used vaccine adjuvant in the US, failed to provide satisfactory augmentation of immune responses for flu vaccines in humans. We develop a prototype laser system capable of enhancing and prolonging immune responses against protein-based vaccines including season flu vaccine with few side effects. We are exploring this laser vaccine adjuvant (LVA) for dose- sparing of existing seasonal and pandemic flu vaccines. We will investigate whether immune protection elicited by a low dosage of season flu vaccine intradermally or intramuscularly injected into a site of laser exposure is equal to or greater than that induced by a higher dosage of the vaccine injected similarly in Balb/c and C57BL/6 (B6) mice and in minipigs to verify the feasibility of this technology in different animal species with varying skins. A similar study will also be conducted in old and young mice to corroborate that LVA can reduce vaccination doses from two to one in naive young mice and significantly enhance a respondent rate of flu vaccination in old mice. Finally, we will extend the investigation to H5N1 pandemic flu vaccine, protecting mice and ferrets from a lethal challenge of a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 flu virus after one dose of the stockpiled H5N1 vaccine delivered via a combination of LVA and MF59 adjuvant. The laser  adjuvant  does not need cold chain storage or any modification to the existing vaccines, and it can be used immediately and repeatedly without a limit. These unique characters make this technology ideal for coping with flu vaccine shortages.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a prototype hepadnavirus with 400 million chronic carriers worldwide. Chronic HBV infection is a main risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), causing >50% of all HCCs. Early in infection, HBV spreads virtually throughout the entire liver, but during chronic infection, areas of apparently virus-freehepatocytes (20-90% of the entire hepatocyte population) appear regardless of the ongoing viremia. These findings were made in HBV-infected humans and chimpanzees and in woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), which is closely related to HBV. These observations, along with the analysis of kinetics of the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants, laid the foundation for a long-standing unresolved argument in the HBV field that in chronic infection, cell-to-cell spread of a hepadnavirus is at least very inefficient (if it occursat all), and super-infection is an unlikely event. It was proposed that chronic hepadnavirus infectioncan be maintained exclusively via division of the infected hepatocytes in the absence of the spread. Super-infection exclusion was shown for HBV-related duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), and was suggested for HBV and WHV. However, the absence of the viral cell-to-cell spread and super-infection in chronic infections with either WHV or HBV has not been confirmed or dismissed. Therefore, in Aim 1, we propose to determine directly whether the cell-to-cell spread of hepadnavirus and super-infection of already infected cells occur during chronic infection, which would indicate that spread could be an essential factor for maintenance of chronic infection and thus could also be a so far unrecognized risk factor of HCC. In addition, HCCs are also frequently reported as being apparently virus-free in HBV carrier humans and WHV carrier woodchucks, suggesting that HCCs arise from altered hepatocytes that have lost the ability to support efficient hepadnavirus replication, and thus have a selective advantage for a clonal expansion since they are no longer targeted by the immune system. This has led us to Aim 2 that will determine (i) if hepadnavirus-induced HCC is still susceptible to infection with a hepadnavirus, and (ii) what controls the apparent virus-free status of HCC. We propose to use an invaluable surrogate model to study HBV infection and especially HCC development - WHV carrier woodchucks. We will super-infect WHV carriers with early HCCs with a different natural infectious WHV strain, WHVNY, which has a unique deletion and thus can be easily discriminated from the strain WHV7 used for the primary infection. We will (i) directly determine the susceptibility of normal hepatocytes and HCCs to WHVNY super-infection; and (ii) address if the immune system controls the ability of cells to get re-infected. Overall, the proposed study will greatly improve our understanding of the mechanism of chronic hepadnavirus infection in relation to HCC development. It has the potential to identify infectivity of virions and virus spred as important factors of pathogenesis and HCC risk, and may facilitate the use of entry inhibitors that bind the HBV receptor and block virus spread as new therapeutics for battling chronic HBV infection and reducing HCC risk.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (the Virginia Tech), and the LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. will team together for this application in response to RFA-AI-09-027, entitled  Partnerships for Biodefense Food- and Water-borne Diseases (R01). We propose to develop a vaccine against noroviruses (NVs), one of the NIAID Category B food- and water-borne priority pathogens, based on our newly discovered subviral particle, the P particle, of NVs. This P particle is spontaneously formed by 24 copies of the protrusion (P) domain of the viral capsid protein, in octahedral symmetry, with an authentic host receptor binding property, highly immunogenic, easily to produce in E. coli and yeast with extremely high yields and simple procedures for purification, and highly stable under a wide range of physic-chemical conditions, making it an excellent subunit vaccine for mucosal immunization. Four projects representing different early-to-middle product development stages will be performed to evaluate the P particle vaccine. In stage 1 we will perform in vitro and mouse immunization studies and compare different vaccination regimens of P particles by different routes with/without an adjuvant for a maximal safety and efficacy. We also will perform similar studies for proof-of-concept of the usefulness of P particle vaccine using the cell culture model of a newly discovered monkey calicivirus, the Tulane virus. In stage 2 we will characterize the antigenic variations of NVs representing different genotypes of NVs for developing a broadly reactive vaccine based on defined antigenic types (serotypes) with a cocktail or consensus vaccine approach. We also will perform genetic and antigenic analysis of the currently dominant GII-4 viruses to address a question about epochal evolution of NVs for future vaccine strategy against NVs. In stage 3 we will further characterize the safety, immunogenicity and broadness of the candidate vaccine in protection against various NVs using the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig challenge model of human NVs developed in our laboratories recently. In the last stage we will develop a fermentation bioreactor for scale up production of P particles for future evaluation of the vaccine by human volunteer challenge studies and clinical trials. NVs are genetically diverse and there is no suitable cell culture for NVs. Our cocktail/consensus vaccine approach and the procedures for evaluation of the vaccine by the surrogate  neutralization  assay and using the newly discovered Tulane virus and the Gn pig model are highly innovative. We are confident that a panel of lead candidates (vaccine strains) will be selected ready for future clinical trials by the conclusion of the studies in this application.  Narrative/Relevance: Noroviruses (NVs) are an important cause of acute gastroenteritis, affecting people of all ages, in both developed and developing countries. The wide spread nature of NVs due to the low infection dose and the high stability and resistance to disinfectants makes NVs an easy agent for bioterrorist attack. In this study we propose to develop a vaccine against NVs based on our newly discovered subviral particle, the P particle, of NVs. This P particle is spontaneously formed by 24 copies of the protrusion (P) domain of the viral capsid protein, with an authentic host receptor binding property, highly immunogenic, ease to produce in E. coli and yeast with extremely high yields and simple procedures for purification. It is highly stable under a wide range of physic-chemical conditions making it an excellent subunit vaccine for mucosal immunization. NVs have been known to cause a brief protective immunity following a natural infection. In this study we will perform mouse immunization studies with different vaccination regimens and immunization routes of the P particle vaccine for the maximal efficacy and safety. NVs are also genetically diverse but our recent data showed that the receptor binding interfaces of NVs are highly conserved due to a convergent evolution selected by the human histo-blood group antigens. We will perform antigenic characterization of NVs representing different genotypes to design a cocktail/consensus vaccine based on defined antigenic types ( serotypes ) using a surrogate neutralization assay (receptor blocking assay). NVs remain difficult to cultivate in vitro. We will take advantage of the cell culture system of our newly discovered rhesus monkey calicivirus, the Tulane virus, and the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human NVs to prove concept and to further evaluate usefulness of the vaccine for future development in clinical trials. This project will be conducted by a research team with multidiscipline experts in molecular virology, immunology, vaccine development at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) and the LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. Our highly innovative approach of the unique P particles and the cocktail/consensus vaccine and the novel procedures for evaluation of the vaccine by the surrogate  neutralization  assay and using the newly discovered Tulane virus and the Gn pig model warrant that we will make a rapid progress leading to the next level of evaluation by the phase I clinical trials toward future commercialization.\",\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gammaherpesviruses result in lifelong infection associated with malignancies and other chronic disease in immune deficient individuals. The human gammaherpesviruses include Epstein Barr virus and Kaposi's Sarcoma associated virus, which are associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, peritoneal effusion lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Given the strict host specificity of the human gammaherpesviruses, a major challenge is to understand the host and viral factors that regulate the outcome of gammaherpesvirus infection in vivo, in both healthy and immune compromised individuals. This proposal makes extensive use of the mouse gammaherpesvirus 68, to investigate the genetic contribution of viral and host genes in shaping the outcome of infection. Through our previous work, we developed an extensive knowledge of the precise in vivo contexts in which a viral gene, the viral cyclin, promotes chronic infection. We identified seven different parameters of gammaherpesvirus infection and disease, including models of immune deficiency that are dependent on the virus encoded cyclin homolog. In this grant, we will dissect the molecular pathways used by the viral cyclin to promote infection in vivo, using recombinant viruses in which the viral cyclin has been replaced by alternate viral or cellular cyclins. We will characterize the viral cyclin activity in all cyclin dependent aspects of infection, identify the infected cell reservoir in presence and absence of the viral cyclin, and define the molecular mechanism of the viral cyclin in both persistent infection and reactivation from latency infection.These recombinant viruses reveal distinct, non-overlapping mechanisms of viral cyclin action. Moreover, since different cellular cyclins are able to substitute for distinct phases of the viral infection, comparing the biochemical properties of different cyclins in distinct contexts of infection will result in significant insights in gammaherpesvirus infection and disease. By integrating our unique in vivo insights into the viral cyclin with these recombinant viruses and our identification of the cellular target of the viral cyclin in virus reactivation, this grant wil combine biochemistry and genetics, with in vitro and in vivo models of infection to define new molecular pathways that promote gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis in the whole animal. Further, we propose to test candidate inhibitors of viral cyclins and viral cyclin dependent functions both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, our demonstration that host cyclins can facilitate virus infection and that a specific host tumor suppressor can repress virus reactivationpromises that our investigation of the virus encoded cyclins will advance the field of cancer biology beyond virus associated oncogenesis. These studies of the v-cyclin have, and will continue to yield fundamental insights into gammaherpesvirus infection and further elucidate new mechanisms by which gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis can be abrogated.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy, especially in the elderly and during pandemic years. Influenza virus pathogenesis has two driving forces, virus replication and host responses. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems biology approach to identify and validate key early genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. Our overall underlying hypothesis is that host genes and networks involved in viral replication and in host response represent targets for therapeutic intervention. In order to identify these networks we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models OMICS responses during influenza virus infection in ex vivo relevant human cells (Project 1) and in an animal model of influenza virus infection (Project 2). Our proposed research will compare systematically three clinically relevant influenza virus strains that differ n virulence both in mice and in humans. Core E will construct models by the integration of functional genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics (Core B), proteomics (including post-translational modifications, Core C) and metabolomics (Core D) that will result in the identification of key genes, networks and subnetworks likely to be involved in virus replication and host responses. We propose an innovate modeling approach (Core E) based on acquisition of global OMICS data followed by model refinement using focused targeted-OMICS approaches, which allows for an extensive experimental interrogation of the generated models. The identified network nodes and subnetworks by these models will be validated and interrogated using targeted -OMICS in Projects 1 and 2 by conducting perturbations including: use of specific virus mutants that disrupt key host-virus interactions, use of host gene inhibitors and use of mouse k.o. and antisense targeting of key host genes in a mouse model. The results of these perturbations will be incorporated into the model for refinement and increase of predictive values. In addition, humans will be screened in Project 3 for polymorphisms in key genes predicted to be involved in pathogenesis by our models, and cells from rare variants will be tested ex vivo for their response to influenza infection. By using an established well characterized human cohort for these studies we will investigate clinical outcomes associated with the variants. We hypothesize that our approach will result in the identification of novel hosttargets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection.      RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic approach (FLUOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting pathogenic potential of new influenza viruses, b) give us the ability to predict which populations may be more susceptible to disease based on genetic variability, and c) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.      Project 1: Ex Vivo Interrogation of the Genetic and Biochemical Networks Controlling Influenza Virus Infection   Project Leader: Megan Shaw       DESCRIPTION: The underlying hypothesis of this application is that critical molecular features of host-pathogen interactions and responses dictate the pathogenic outcome of viral infection. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of viral-host interactions, innate responses to viral infection, and viral evasion strategies is pivotal for predictive modeling of viral pathogenesis. Here, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic, chemical, and biochemical networks that play a role in controlling influenza virus infection by investigating host-virus interactions in an ex vivo setting using primary human cells. The impact of influenza virus replication on the host will be studied using next generation sequencing technologies to interrogate cellular RNA populations to define transcriptome-level changes (RNA-Seq), conduct genome-wide survey of promoters engaged by RNA polymerase (GRO-Seq), as well as evaluate epigenetic alterations in the chromosomal landscape (CHiP-Seq). Furthermore, global alterations in intracellular and extracellular metabolite levels, protein abundance, as well as post-translational modifications induced upon viral infection will be measured. Combining these approaches with genome-wide functional genomic screening and high-throughput protein interactome analysis will enable the generation of high-resolution networks that accurately depict the hierarchies of interactions between influenza virus and the host. By conducting these analyses simultaneously with three viruses that drive varying pathogenic outcomes, computational modeling of these data will enable us to identify critical nodes of the viral-host network that are predictive of viral pathogenesis. The in vivo and clinical impact of these nodes will be evaluated in Projects 2 and 3, respectively.      RELEVANCE: Developing novel therapies for influenza requires a systems-level understanding of the virus-host interactions. Predictive modeling of these networks will enable the identificatio of disease-relevant therapeutic targets that can be pharmacologically manipulated for clinical efficacy. Towards this end, in this project, we will conduct a series of global and targeted analyses of influenza host-pathogen interactions, and follow these with focused validation studies.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The prognosis for survival in patients with metastatic melanoma has not changed in the last 20 years and remains dismal despite advances in tumor detection and the development of melanoma-specific systemic therapies. Because of the failure of current chemotherapeutic and immunologically- based treatments to eradicate melanoma, we propose a new approach. In this proposal, we test a replication-competent oncolytic virus generated in this lab at Yale, VSVrp30. In preliminary tests VSVrp30 shows considerable promise in the potential treatment of melanoma. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the virus selectively and rapidly infects and destroys human metastatic melanoma, with relatively little or no infection of normal human melanocytes. We seek funding to pursue experiments to determine if the virus can target and destroy melanoma cells in multiple conditions in animal and in vitro models. We will first test the oncolytic actions of the virus with a series of in vitro experiments on a large number of human melanomas and normal melanocytes available at Yale. Another set of experiments will employ human melanoma that is stably transfected with a coral reporter gene that generates a red fluorescence in the cancer cells. These human cells will be transplanted into SCID mice, both as a solid tumor, and as dispersed metastatic-like cancer cells. Virus will be given intratumorally and intravenously to test the hypothesis that the virus wll target and kill the red tumor cells with minimal infection of normal cells. Infected cells can be readily detected by the expression of a GFP reporter incorporated into the viral genome. A third set of parallel experiments will be done using the mouse melanoma line B16 in syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice with a normal immune system, allowing us to test the hypothesis that the virus can selectively detect and destroy melanoma in the presence of a normal immune system, and prolong mouse survival from melanoma; if the virus does not completely eliminate the melanoma cells, we will test the secondary hypothesis that temporarily depressing the systemic or innate immune systems with immunosuppressant drugs will enhance the oncolytic actions of the virus. A fourth set of experiments will examine the genetic mechanisms underlying the increased viral infection of melanoma cells, using an extensive series of human melanomas in which the exomes have been sequenced. These experiments will be complemented by experiments to test the hypothesis that specific induced gene mutations involving BRAF, PTEN, and CDKN2A that are common to melanoma, directly increase virus infection. A final series of experiments will test the hypothesis that the virus can cross the blood brain barrier and selectively destroy melanoma in the mouse brain, and that pre-immunization, potentially followed by transient immunosuppression, will enhance oncolysis and provide another layer of protection to the brain. If we detect collateral damage to normal brain, then we will test a new virus, 1,2-VSV, that we recently generated which is the most attenuated of any VSV we have worked with, yet still targets melanoma. Its highly attenuated nature reduces concerns relating to infection of normal brain tissue. If these experiments are successful, they will form a major advance toward clinical trials for metastatic melanoma in humans.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need for interventions to increase hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment uptake among HIV/HCV-co-infected persons. End-stage liver disease is now a leading cause of death among HIV-positive persons, largely due to untreated chronic HCV infection, and rates of HCV treatment uptake remain low despite significant advances in the effectiveness of HCV treatment. This study will develop an intervention addressing patient-level barriers (Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills) to HCV treatment uptake in HIV-co-infected patients and test its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminay efficacy. Based on formative research, we have developed the  Psychosocial Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C) . PREP-C is a structured web-based interview that provides an assessment of a client's psychosocial readiness to begin HCV treatment and identifies domains of functioning which require intervention to improve treatment readiness. PREP-C has been piloted in almost 100 patients and a telemedicine resource for health care providers was launched in 2012 (www.prepC.org). In this study, we will develop and test an integrated assessment-behavioral intervention to increase HCV treatment initiation among HIV-co-infected patients. Our specific aims are: (1) To formally adapt existing behavioral medicine interventions based on PREP-C assessment to target individual barriers (Information, Motivation, and Behavior Skills) to HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected patients who are medically eligible for HCV treatment, pilot test and refine the tailored intervention in 15 HIV/HCV-co-infected patients, and finalize the intervention manual. (2) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial with 60 HIV/HCV-co-infected patients who are medically eligible for HCV treatment, comparing the nurse-delivered PREP-C intervention (n=30) with attention control (n=30) in order to evaluate patient acceptance, patient satisfaction, enrollment and retention, as well as preliminary efficacy (initiation of HCV treatment within 6 months of randomization and persistence and adherence to the first 12 weeks of treatment in those who do initiate treatment). We hypothesize that the PREP-C intervention will increase Motivation, Information, and Self-Efficacy leading to higher rates of HCV treatment initiation, persistence and adherence in the PREP-C intervention arm. Findings from this vanguard study will inform the design parameters of a larger, more rigorous evaluation in an R01 application, if results are promising. The PREP-C web-based assessment and intervention package is designed to be scalable and can be disseminated through the live PrepC.org web site. The proposed study is innovative in that it seeks to develop the first web-based intervention for health care providers t use to increase HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co-infected persons. The study can have a major public health impact by providing needed structured resources for health care providers to increase rates of HCV treatment initiation in HIV/HCV-co- infected persons, thereby reducing mortality due to end-stage liver disease.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex viruses cause considerable morbidity and mortality. They undergo a lytic, productive infection at the mucosal sites and spread into sensory ganglia, where they undergo a latent infection for the life of the host. Reactivation leadsto recurrent infection and disease. Antiviral drugs have been defined that  inhibit the lytic infection cycle, but there are no approaches that target the latent virus. We have defined the  role of viral gene products such as LAT and ICPO in modulating the chromatin structure during lytic and  latent infection, but further basic information is needed about these mechanisms for discovery of  therapeutics that target HSV latent infection. In this application our specific aims are: a. To test hypotheses  for possible mechanisms by which the HSV latency-associated transcript reduces lytic gene expression  during acute infection and during latent infection of trigeminal ganglia: LAT acts as a long noncoding RNA  that recruits histone-modifying complexes to the viral genome, b. LAT leads to chromatin changes by  serving as a precursor to an miRNA that reduces ICPO expression through studies of miRNA mutant viruses (with Coen lab), c. LAT regulatory DNA sequences act in a cis-acting manner to promote chromatin on the  viral lytic genes, d. LAT leads to differential targeting of the viral genome through studies of genome  targeting in cultured neurons with the Leib lab. 2. To define the mechanisms by which the HSV ICPO protein  regulates chromatin structure during acute infection and latent infection of trigeminal ganglia. We have  exciting unpublished results that ICPO mutant viruses have a different chromatin profile on their genome  during latent infection. We will test the hypothesis that ICPO acts to alter the chromatin state by recruiting histone modification enzymes to viral and cellular genes. 3. To define Interactions between LAT and ICPO  in regulating HSV chromatin. We will test the hypothesis that LAT forms duplex RNA with ICPO transcripts to recruit histone modifying enzymes by mutating the ICPO promoter or mutating the ICPO translational initiation site and by constructing LAT and ICPO double mutant viruses to determine their combinatorial effects on latent infection, and viral chromatin.        RELEVANCE:  Herpes simplex viruses cause considerable genital, ocular and nervous system disease, and genital herpes increases the risk of HIV infection. There are drugs that target the active growth of herpes simplex virus but  none that target the latent infection.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mumps virus (MuV), a paramyxovirus, causes acute inflammatory infections in humans involving most organ systems. Mumps virus infection was the most common cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis before mass immunization with the mumps virus vaccine. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a single dose immunization of MuV vaccine in 1977 and in 1989 ACIP recommended to increase MuV vaccine to two doses. Even with widespread vaccination programs in place, mumps outbreaks continue to occur. The largest MuV outbreak in the US after implementation of two-dose MuV vaccination program occurred in 2006. It is considered the first failure of two-dose MuV vaccination. In 2010, a large MuV outbreak occurred in NY/NJ area. While definitive causes for the outbreaks are not known, possible reasons (not mutually exclusive) for these outbreaks include (1) waning immunity and (2) vaccine failure due to emergence of a new mumps virus strain. The fact that outbreaks had occurred in populations with over 95% coverage of two-dose MuV vaccine strongly suggests that the current vaccine is not effective. The current vaccine is based on genotype A while outbreaks were caused by genotype G MuV. All these possible causes indicate a need for a new vaccine that is effective against current outbreak strain of mumps virus. Long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a new mumps virus vaccine with long-lasting immunity. We hypothesize that MuV mutants generated using reverse genetics system are good vaccine candidates. We propose to develop a novel mumps virus vaccine by attenuating virus through introducing mutations at desirable locations within the genome and to test immunogenicity of vaccine candidates in mice and ferrets.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of the research proposed is to create a new RNA virus vaccine using a novel self-assembling nanoparticle packaging method, designed to overcome safety, cost and other limitations that slow vaccine development. Virus-based vaccines have the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immunity, which can improve vaccine potency compared to other methods of vaccine delivery. RNA virus based vaccines have improved safety compared to DNA virus vaccines because they can't integrate into the host genome, but are still limited by cell-based capsid packaging methods that are costly and limit vaccine boosting. Our preliminary data show that by removing all native capsid assembly constraints self-assembling vaccines can be made with improved safety, vaccine stability, and at very low cost, simply by mixing RNA and coat protein together. The Specific Aims of this research plan are 1) to modify the insect Flock House Virus RNA genome with a non-native capsid origin of assembly and confirm in vitro particle formation, 2) to insert a foreig reporter transgene under the control of a virus promoter and evaluate the protein accumulation in cells, and 3) to combine the transgene expression and nanoparticle self-assembly, and to confirm that both are functional. The resulting product is a viral RNA vaccine with packaging characteristics independent of its native capsid, while retaining the virus characteristics that make it a good vaccine antigen. That includes nM particulate size for optimal antigen uptake by immune cells, stability at room temperature for years, and the ability to safely carry viral transgene expression into immune cells without the risk of virus reconstitution. Flock House Virus was selected for self-assembly because it also has many desirable characteristics. It is not a mammalian pathogen, and thus will exhibit improved safety. It has very high levels of antigen expression in mammalian cell types, and greatly reduced cell death compared to RNA viruses currently used in vaccine development. Flock House Virus has not been previously exploited for vaccine development because the native capsid packaging characteristics significantly limit transgene insert size and the virus particles still need to be made in cell culture. The expected outcome of this application will be to overcome native capsid packaging limitations, and create a self-assembling RNA nanoparticle based on the Flock House Virus genome, with high level antigen expression. Our research is significant, because it will fulfill our long-term objective tocreate cost effective, safe and robust RNA vaccines, and it is innovative because we will validate that any RNA virus with desirable characteristics can be adapted for nanoparticle self- assembly, and increase the pace of RNA vaccine development for human use.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of genital ulcers and infects a half-billion people worldwide. Genital herpes is emotionally distressing, is life threatening to newborns infected during delivery, and is a major risk factor fr acquiring and transmitting HIV infection. Daily suppressive antiviral therapy is currently the onlytreatment available for recurrent genital herpes infections; however, this approach is only partially successful in preventing outbreaks and is ineffective in reducing HIV acquisition.    We will evaluate the efficacy of two immunotherapeutic vaccines at controlling HSV-2 recurrent infection. The vaccines were pioneered in our lab; one involves a HSV-2 replication competent, attenuated live virus (gE2-del) and the other a trivalent subunit antigen vaccine (gC2/gD2/gE2). A replication competent varicella zoster live virus vaccine is currently used to prevent shingles, which is a recurrent infection caused by a closely related herpes virus. We will evaluate the live virus and subunit antigen vaccines individually and in combination with the expectation that the live virus vaccine will stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, while the gC2/gD2/gE2 subunit antigen vaccine will improve humoral immunity. HSV-2 gD is included to enhance neutralizing antibodies, gD2 and gE2 to stimulate antibodies that block cell-to-cell spread, and gC2 and gE2 to produce antibodies that prevent immune evasion from antibody and complement. The impressive efficacy of the trivalent subunit antigens as a prophylactic vaccine for primary genital herpes in mice supports the concept of blocking immune evasion as immunotherapy for recurrent infections.    In the R21 phase, we will evaluate the live virus and trivalent subunit antigen vaccines for their ability to reduce the frequency and severity of recurrent genital infection in guinea pigs. We willdetermine whether immunotherapy reduces the infiltration into genital tissues of CD4+ T-cells that are permissive for HIV replication (R33 phase). We will evaluate the immune correlates of protection against recurrent genital infection by measuring innate, antibody and T cell immune responses in HSV-2 infected guinea pigs that are either mock-vaccinated or immunized with the best-performing therapeutic vaccine (R33 phase). Defining the immune correlates of protection will facilitate future studies that address whether comparable immune responses can be generated in HSV-2 infected humans. We will determine whether therapeutic immunization with gC2/gD2/gE2 subunit antigens selects for mutants that emerge under immune pressure in vivo by using single genome amplification (SGA) technology to compare mutant variants detected in the virus inoculum, virus isolated during acute infection and virus isolated after therapeutic immunization (R21 and R33 phases). SGA provides an accurate detection assay for minor mutant variants within a virus pool that is more sensitive for detecting mutations in conformational epitopes that other sequencing methods and is an innovative approach to identify potentially unwanted consequences of an otherwise successful immunotherapeutic vaccine.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection results in ~60% mortality in patients who present respiratory abnormalities from dyspnea and pulmonary inflammation during the first 6 days post-infection to respiratory failure with hypoxemia, leading to death several days later. The mechanisms underlying the respiratory failure responsible for the infection-induced death are unclear and no effective vaccine/treatment is available. Animal studies have focused on immunology and virology of the infection without studying respiratory pathophysiology. Additionally, these studies showed that upon pulmonary infection, the lethal H5N1 viruses, differing from nonlethal ones, initially invaded (2-3 days post-infection) the vagus nerve and then brain, resulting in death 8 days post-infection, pointing to a possible vagal involvement in H5N1 pathology. Pulmonary sensory fibers traveling within the vagus nerve are composed primarily of bronchopulmonary C-fibers (PCFs). Stimulation of PCFs peripherally triggers dyspnea and pulmonary inflammation and centrally induces depressed hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses (dHVR and dHCVR). These peripheral and central effects are achieved by PCFs releasing SP into the lungs and the middle region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (mNTS) to act on local neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), respectively. Because dHVR and dHCVR are responsible for generating respiratory failure, we recently tested these chemoreflexes at the early stage of the viral infection. Our preliminary data showed that HK483 (a lethal H5N1 strain) but not HK486 virus (a nonlethal one) led to remarkable dHVR and dHCVR 2-3 days post-infection without viremia and killed the mice 8 days post-infection. Interestingly, this death was absent in PCF-degenerated or SP-knockout mice. Therefore, in this project, we will first characterize the HK483 virus-induced cardiorespiratory disorders by measuring cardiorespiratory activities, pulmonary changes, and chemoreflexes in mice over the infection period and correlate the disorders to respiratory failure (death), thereby building a bas for further mechanistic studies. Second, we will define that HK483 virus invades PCFs to increase their activity and sensitivity and that PCF degeneration diminishes or prevents the virus-induced respiratory disorders (death). Third, we will reveal that HK483 virus promotes PCF-dependent SP release into the lungs and mNTS to upregulate NK1R expression in PCFs and mNTS neurons receiving PCF inputs. Moreover, the effects of systemic or peripheral blockade of NK1Rs and selective lesion of mNTS NK1R neurons on the HK483 virus-induced cardiorespiratory disorders and death will be determined. In this project, electrophysiological, biochemical, pharmacological, and immunocytochemical approaches will be used. Our predicted results as described above will: 1) form a novel neurovirological concept that lethal H5N1 virus invades PCFs to induce their morphological and functional changes; 2) gain new insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the lethal viral infection-induced respiratory failure; and 3) catalyze the development of preventive strategies and pharmacological therapies to protect against respiratory failure and death.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opiate abuse and overdose have surged in the past 15 years. Drug overdose, mostly from opiates, is now the US' second leading cause of accidental death. Most drug abuse treatment systems use passive approaches to link drug abusers to treatment, resulting in delayed entry into treatment, often subsequent to adverse impacts on health and society. Major structural and motivational barriers impede opiate abusers' engagement in treatment. Recent healthcare reform legislation presents opportunities to test proactive, public health approaches to identifying and linking drug abusers to treatment. While screening and brief intervention (BI) have shown effectiveness in addressing alcohol abuse in healthcare settings, research suggests that for those drug dependent, there is a need for enhanced BI and linkage to specialty treatment. Opiate abusers disproportionately use emergency medical services (EMS), as they do EDs, and our research suggests a significant number refuse transport to EDs. While EMS systems are in a prime position to intervene on drug abuse, few currently do so. Research suggests drug abusers may be motivated to engage in treatment at times of health emergencies, and that brief intervention (BI), free treatment, and incentives may further enhance treatment entry. In a prior study, EMS providers' discussing drug treatment with patients at times of overdose was associated with their entering treatment. Yet only 17% of EMS providers discussed treatment then, representing a missed opportunity for intervention. The proposed study tests the feasibility and effects on opiate abuse treatment entry of a novel EMS approach to drug abuse screening, and coordinated, enhanced BI to improve current linkage to treatment practices. All participants will be given vouchers for free treatment and active referral for on-demand treatment at any of the city's treatment facilities through the Baltimore City Health Department's (BCHD's) usual practice, a treatment information and referral (I&R) phone line. The half of participants randomized to the incentive arm will receive a nominal tangible incentive for treatment entry confirmed by record review. The study will compare outcomes across study arms and to a matched sample of I&R clients who (self-) refer using usual linkage to opiate abuse treatment practices. The study is enabled by electronic information systems seldom used in drug abuse treatment research. The academic-interagency collaboration builds on study team members' decades of successful relevant research with the study population. .\",\n",

My surroundings at Vanderbilt are ideal for my proposed project and my career development. The intellectual environment could not be better, and I intend to take full advantage of this by attending a structured program of coursework. My mentor's laboratory has a tremendous amount of experience isolating and studying human monoclonal antibodies, central to my proposal and to the concept of rational vaccine design. My mentor, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, also has great expertise in vaccinology, immunology, and viral pathogenesis. While at Vanderbilt and under his mentorship, my work has been rapidly evolving so as to launch my career as an independent investigator. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges in disease severity from an influenza-like illness to life-threatening shock. One model of the mechanism underlying severe disease proposes that weakly cross-reactive antibodies induced during a primary infection facilitate virus entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells during a subsequent secondary infection. This is thought to increase viral replication and release of cytokines and vasoactive mediators, culminating in shock. This unique process, known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, has significantly hindered vaccine development. There is a concern that potent neutralizing antibodies must be generated to all four dengue virus serotypes, as a vaccine that induces weakly cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies may increase the likelihood of developing severe disease upon re-exposure. Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies using mouse mAbs. However, antibody responses in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology developed in our laboratory, it is now possible to generate human hybridomas reliably with B cells from the peripheral blood of individuals who have recovered from an infection. Employing this technology, we have generated over 250 hybridomas secreting human mAbs to dengue virus from subjects who had recovered from primary or secondary infection. The vast majority of these antibodies are broadly serotype cross-reactive, directed against either envelope or pre-membrane protein, and capable of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Interestingly, very rare serotype-specific, potently neutralizing antibodies, which are nearly devoid of enhancing activity, are also produced by humans in response to infection. Understanding the epitopes and activity of these naturally-occurring antibodies is critical for vaccine development, as vaccines that induce high potency neutralizing antibodies that lack enhancing activity are desirable. Ideally, the reactivity of epitopes bound byenhancing antibodies should be reduced or eliminated in candidate antigens during the rational development of a dengue vaccine, so as to discourage such dominant recognition of these antigenic features by the humoral immune response. The long-term goal is to use such molecular information in the rational design of dengue vaccines that enhance the induction of protective neutralizing antibodies and reduce the risk of development of severe disease.       NARRATIVE: This mentored proposal outlines ambitious studies and career development, in which I will isolate potently neutralization human monoclonal antibodies to dengue viruses and determine the biochemical, structural, and genetic basis for their binding. In the process of determining fine details of the dengue virus neutralizing immune response, I will acquire skills inthe areas of virology, immunology, genetics and recombinant antibody techniques. These skills, along with didactic coursework, will help me to develop my career, as a physician-scientist, in a direction independently of my mentor.\",\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTInfluenza pandemics are among the foremost international public health challenges of the 21st century.Eleven probable and three possible pandemics have occurred in the past four-hundred years. The April,2009 outbreak of a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) in Mexico City demonstrated that infection can betransmitted globally in days and cause disproportionate morbidity and mortality in young adults, pregnantwomen, and minorities. The 2009 (H1N1) Pandemic has been defined by its transmissibility and case-fatality proportion as a  mild  pandemic; the WHO estimates that a more severe pandemic could causehundreds of millions of deaths, and overwhelm healthcare capacity. Even during this mild pandemic,hospitals and ICUs were operating near or at surge capacity during peaks of transmission. Public healthofficials have limited decision support technology to plan for or prevent healthcare utilization surge in futureinfluenza pandemics. Despite an appropriate public health response to the ongoing pandemic, severalinfluenza A viruses remain pandemic threats. The exact timing of the next influenza pandemic is uncertain,but there is no doubt that another one will occur.Over the past three years, I have developed skills in cost-effectiveness analysis and infectious diseasemodeling by designing an influenza disease transmission model to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative pandemic mitigation strategies. Several of my model parameters are based onassumptions or data from seasonal influenza epidemics or 20th century pandemics, and my model is limitedto the spread of pandemic influenza within a city. I would like to improve the accuracy of the modelparameters and expand its geographical scope in order to compare the effectiveness of healthcareutilization surge preparation strategies and to inform pandemic healthcare decision support. To do so, Ineed to develop additional skills in large database analysis and multivariable statistical modeling bycompleting coursework and projects under the guidance of an experienced, multi-disciplinary team ofmentors and advisors. Combined with my existing methodological background, these skills will enable meto perform research as an independent investigator in infectious disease health policy.The 2009 (H1N1) Pandemic, occurring in an era with advanced healthcare database collection, hasprovided a unique opportunity for me to meet all of these objectives by: (1) Measuring influenza-relatedhealthcare costs and utilization during a pandemic; (2) Incorporating length-of-stay results from Aim 1 intomultivariate analyses to predict the temporal spread of peak influenza healthcare utilization; (3) Inputtingresults of Aims 1 and 2 into my pandemic influenza transmission model to compare the effectiveness andcost-effectiveness of alternative surge preparation strategies over a range of pandemic severities; and (4)Disseminating results of Aims 1, 2, and 3 through CDC to update healthcare decision support technology.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Viruses induce disease in the central nervous system (CNS) by either killing or disrupting essential functions of neurons within the brain and spinal cord. We propose to use well characterized models of virus-induced CNS disease to investigate the mechanisms by which viruses cause neuronal cell death and injury to the brain and spinal cord. We will delineate the specific cell signaling pathways involved in virus-induced death and tissue injury within the CNS and evaluate these signaling pathways as therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease. Our experiments are expected to lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for virus- induced CNS disease.  Apoptosis is an established mechanism of virus-induced cell death during viral encephalitis and occurs in the brain following experimental infection with a wide variety of viruses. Apoptosis is also emerging as a mechanism of motor neuron cell death in virus-induced myelitis in humans. Inhibition of caspase 3, the executioner caspase of apoptotic cell death, results in decreased severity of virus-induced encephalitis. In specific aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that inhibition of the signaling pathways that lead to apoptotic cell death wil prevent neuronal death and provide novel targets for virus induced brain and spinal cord disease following infection with a variety of clinically relevant viruses. Reovirus infection of neonatal mice provides a well characterized model system for understanding viral pathogenesis within both the brain and spinal cord. We have already identified that the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and JNK signaling are activated in the brain following reovirus infection and contribute to reovirus-induced neuronal apoptosis. We propose to identify whether these pathways are also activated: (i) in our recently developed model of reovirus-induced myelitis: (ii)in the brains of mice infected with West Nile Virus (WNV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV): (iii) following virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV) infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and: (iv) in human tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease, and to characterize their role in viral pathogenesis.  Virus infection of the CNS results in activation of innate immune responses, including the up-regulation of interferon (IFN) and increased expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISG). ISG influence apoptosis, although the mechanism by which this occurs and the role of these genes in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. In specific aim 2 we will investigate the role of specific ISG, with putative apoptotic functions, in virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV)-induced pathogenesis within the mouse brain and spinal cord, following viral infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and in tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease.  Gliosis (activation of microglia and astrocytes) is a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Gliosis has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo following infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and inflammatory mediators associated with gliosis have been detected in the brain during viral encephalitis. However, the role of gliosis in acute virus-induced CNS disease remains incompletely understood, particularly within the spinal cord. Although gliosis may play a role in inhibiting virl replication by facilitating the removal of infected cells it has been proposed that this protectiverole may be overshadowed by the release of several factors from activated glia that induce neurodegeneration and severe injury to bystander cells. In specific aim 3 we hypothesize that gliosis contributes to pathogenesis following viral infections of the CNS. We will test this hypothesis by investigating the role gliosis in virus (reovirus, WNV, HSV)-induced pathogenesis within the mouse brain and spinal cord, following viral infection of ex vivo brain slice cultures and in tissue from patients with virus-induced CNS disease.',\n",
       " 'The incidence of melanoma has been increasing over the past decades.  The high rates of suffering and morbidity associated with this disease make it imperative that a more effective treatment be developed.  The current treatment is still limited to surgical excision; however, no reliable treatment is available for patients with advanced melanoma.  Recently, targeted immune-based therapies have shown promise; however, the response rates are very low.  Furthermore, substantial efforts have been made to generate vaccines; however, they have been largely unsuccessful.  We propose to use a virus (cytomegalovirus) that causes a chronic infection as a vaccine vector against melanoma.  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects 40%-60% of the population in the United States and more than 90% in the developing world; however, the infection is usually asymptomatic in healthy individuals, which may make CMV as a safe vaccine candidate.  CMV induces a very strong and persistent immune T cell immune response, and thus we believe that we can use these several attractive properties of CMV to generate a vaccine that will provide a robust and long-term protection against melanoma.  Our preliminary data using CMV-based vaccine against melanoma have been very encouraging.  We believe that we can use this virus to retool and harness the natural ability of the immune system to fight and destroy cancer cells.  Therefore, in this grant we propose to generate and test the efficacy of CMV-based vaccines to combat melanoma.  We will use a novel genetic mouse model of human metastatic melanoma.  Recent studies have shown that this mouse model is extremely valuable and will allow us to perform high-throughput preclinical testing of the CMV-based vaccines and other combination therapies that we have proposed in the grant.My current and previous work has been centered upon investigating the mechanisms of T cell responses to acute and chronic infections.  I believe my extensive experiences in investigating T cell responses to infections will provide a fresh new perspective and thinking in the field of tumor immunology.  As a young researcher who is beginning a career as an independent scientist, and someone whose ultimate goal is to become a prominent cancer researcher and significantly contribute towards finding effective therapies against melanoma, this award will provide the funds for achieving the goal of testing our idea of generating a novel melanoma vaccine.The data generated from experiments proposed in this grant will be extremely valuable in helping us achieve our ultimate objective, which is to design and test a safe CMV-based melanoma vaccine for human population.  Furthermore, if CMV-based vaccines offer immediate and long-term protection against melanoma, then this strategy can be applied for several other tumors.  This grant will help us lay the foundation for eventually developing a safe and effective vaccine against melanoma.  Eventually we will devise an attenuated form of the virus to be used in human populations that will direct the immune system (especially T cells) to attack melanoma cancer cells.  The trick will be to ensure that we do not lose the immunogenicity of the virus when we attenuate CMV.  The development of a safe CMV-based vaccine for widespread human use will depend on the results of our studies outlined in this grant and will likely take considerably more than the 2-year funding timeframe of this grant.An attenuated CMV-based vaccine would help patients who are diagnosed with melanoma.  This vaccine may also be used to boost immunity of individuals whose melanoma is in remission after previous treatments.  We believe that this vaccine will provide long-term protection and will likely prevent or delay cancer reoccurrence in patients that have previously been treated for melanoma.  This type of vaccine may provide hope for individuals who fail to respond to older or recently developed immune-based therapies.  Furthermore, it will be interesting to test the efficacy of CMV-based vaccines in combination with other immunotherapies such as Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody).  The risk of using CMV-based vaccines to attack tumor cells, which are  self  cells is the development of autoimmunity.  However, use of steroids and other targeted therapies can be used to mitigate damage that may be caused by any development of autoimmune diseases.We believe our proposed work will likely move the field of tumor immunology into new directions that may not have been realized previously.  We believe that utilizing our extensive experience in investigating how T cells function during acute and chronic infections and applying this knowledge towards devising new ways to fight the serious illness of melanoma will advance this field into new uncharted territories.  This research will be particularly important to those serving in the military; with service personnel currently stationed in  sun intense locales  such as Iraq and Afghanistan military service men and women will face long-term risk of developing skin cancers and thus there is an urgent need to develop and test new therapies against melanoma.',\n",

       " 'The mosquito-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and are the cause of yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile fever syndromes.  In recent years, much of our laboratory effort was focused on the development and preclinical testing of dengue virus vaccine candidates suitable for inclusion in a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.  Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials, and several tetravalent vaccine admixtures have also recently been evaluated in human subjects.  An optimal tetravalent admixture (TV-003) has been selected and is now entering Phase II evaluation.  Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of important functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes,  preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, assistance with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data, 4) support of collaborations with investigators interested in basic virology or immunology studies, 5) preclinical development of potential second-generation vaccine candidates, such as the flavivirus pentavalent vaccine designed for control of dengue and Japanese encephalitis.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the AsiaPacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually.  The high fatality rate and frequent residual neuro-psychiatric sequelae in survivors make JEV infection a considerable health problem. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation pentavalent vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory has recovered these engineered viruses and has begun evaluating their pathogenicity in mice.  The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and thus provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations.  Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes.  A number of the rJEV/DEN4 chimeric viruses based on the DEN4del30 background have also been created.  Re-opening of the ABSL3 animal facility during the last year has allowed us to begin evaluating many of these newly created viruses in mice.',\n",
       " \"The LID is developing live attenuated vaccines against RSV, HPIV3, HMPV, HPIV1, and HPIV2 (listed in the order of decreasing importance). Our emphasis is on RSV, given its importance, although we have clinical studies open for each of these viruses. These vaccines are developed and produced from cloned cDNAs using reverse genetic systems of our making and employing defined attenuating mutations of our making. We develop candidates in pre-clinical studies and prepare vaccine seeds. Vaccine manufacture and clinical evaluation is performed under contact under our supervision. Vaccines are evaluated clinically beginning in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), and moving into successively more vulnerable populations, namely seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age), followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -59 months of age, depending on the virus). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses may be evaluated further in virus-naive infants 1-3 months of age. Adult studies are open-label; pediatric studies are double-blind placebo-controlled with a 2:1 ratio of vaccine to placebo recipients. Since 2006, these activities have been supported in part by a CRADA with MedImmune.RSV vaccine: RSV has two antigenic subgroups, A and B, that have extensive cross-reactivity and cross-protection. We presently are focusing on RSV-A, the more important of the two. We also have developed a reverse genetics system for RSV-B, and once a suitable candidate is prepared for RSV-A, we may prepare a similar RSV-B candidate if deemed necessary. &#8232;&#8232;Under the CRADA, Medimmune is conducting a Phase 1/2a immunogenicity study in young infants with a recombinant rRSV (MEDI-559) that was developed by LID and contains a set of five independent attenuating elements. In a previous phase 1 study by LID, an earlier version of this virus (that differs by 27 silent mutations and appears to be phenotypically indistinguishable) was well-tolerated and immunogenic in 1-2 month old infants. The purpose of the present study is to get further data on safety and immunogenicity.We are conducting a phase I clinical study (NCT01459198) of a live attenuated RSV bearing deletion of the M2-2 coding sequence (delM2-2). This virus exhibits up-regulated viral gene expression that may increase its immunogenicity. This virus was well-tolerated and highly restricted in adults and seropositive children, consistent with a highly-attenuated phenotype. It presently is being evaluated in seronegative children 6-24 months of age. &#8232;&#8232;We previously developed a version of MEDI-559 that was modified to increase its genetic and phenotypic stability. This virus, called RSV cps2, has been approved for a phase I study in seronegative children 6-24 months of age to begin in 2013 (NCT01852266). &#8232;In an accompanying report, we describe development of another vaccine candidate called delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein-2 (NS2) gene, which encodes a protein that antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein (del1313). Deletions of genes and codons can be refractory to reversion or compensation, and thus can provide increased genetic and phenotypic stability. This virus was shown to be suitably attenuated in non-human primates. It is entering phase I studies in 2013, beginning in seropositive children 12-59 months of age, to be followed by seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01893554). &#8232;&#8232;Thus, we have three promising candidates in or entering phase I studies: delM2-2, RSV cps2, and RSV delNS2del1313. These viruses have different properties (such as the presence and magnitude of temperature-sensitivity) and different mechanisms of attenuation (involving effects on RNA synthesis, regulation of RNA synthesis, IFN antagonism, among others). Our goal is to identify a suitable candidate to bring forward into larger phase II studies. &#8232;&#8232;HPIV3 vaccine: We completed a phase I study of two viruses that combined the host range restriction phenotype of BPIV3 with the F and HN neutralization and major protective antigens of HPIV3. In one chimera, rB/HPIV3, all of the genes were from BPIV3 except HN and F; in the other chimera, rHPIV3-Nb, only the N gene was from BPIV3. Both viruses were well-tolerated in seronegative children, but the rB/HPIV3 vaccine was more attenuated and yet more immunogenic than rHPIV3-Nb, and thus may be preferred for further clinical development. The rB/HPIV3 virus also is being used as a vector to express RSV-F (see below).We also are evaluating an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that previously had been shown by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons. This virus is being evaluated in a phase I clinical study in seronegative children 6-36 months of age in which two doses are given at a 6-month interval to investigate the durability of immunity and the feasibility of boosting at this interval (NCT01021397). Part of this study was done as companion protocols through Seattle Children's Hospital and the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. The results showed that the second dose induced an immune response in the few individuals who did not have a response to the first dose, and it boosted immunity in those who had a suboptimal response to the first dose. Importantly, this study also provided further evidence that this vaccine is safe and immunogenic. It is suitable to advance to larger studies. &#8232;&#8232;&#8232;&#8232;HPIV1 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that is attenuated by defined mutations including ones that have been engineered for genetic stability. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that it is highly attenuated. We presently are completing a phase I study in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017). The available results suggest that the virus is over-attenuated. This may be corrected by removing one attenuating mutation.&#8232;&#8232;HPIV2 vaccine: We previously used reverse genetics to generate a live attenuated HPIV2 vaccine virus called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that included stabilized mutations. This virus was highly attenuated in adults. Presently, it is being evaluated in a phase I study in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437). &#8232;&#8232;HMPV vaccine: Last year, we initiated a phase I study of a live attenuated HMPV vaccine virus (rHMPV-Pa) in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that it is highly attenuated. The vaccine is presently being evaluated in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410).Vectored RSV vaccines: We are developing attenuated versions of HPIV1, 2, and 3 as vectors to express the RSV fusion F glycoprotein and RSV G glycoprotein, as described in an attached report. Appropriate candidates will be advanced to clinical studies, which may begin in 2014\",\n",
       " 'Nonhuman primate (NHP) models present the opportunity to test a variety of candidate AIDS vaccines, optimizing their ability to elicit immune responses and testing their ability to prevent infection or to control virus replication after virus challenge. NHP models can be used to optimize vaccines, to evaluate vaccine combinations, to determine vaccine delivery routes that provide immune responses at mucosal portals of entry, to find ways to generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, and, following challenge with virus, to determine whether or not the vaccine immunizations were effective. NHP models can also be used to explore a vaccine¿s impact on the risk of acquisition of infection. NIAID supports NHP studies through both contract (Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contracts) and grant assistance mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'The Vector borne viruses from different virus families account for many medically significant viral pathogens. More specifically, the vector borne flaviviruses, which belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, comprise some of the most important emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are generally transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. The mosquito borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Our current research is focused on the TBFV, but studying the biology of TBFV will reveal insight into the biology of other vector borne viruses. The research in our laboratory employs virology, immunology, advanced imaging techniques, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology, and vector biology. We study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. Studies using LGTV will form the basis for work on the more virulent BSL-3 POWV/DTV and BSL-4 TBFV. Analysis of virus interactions with the invertebrate host. Ixodid ticks represent the natural reservoir of TBFV, are critical for virus persistence in nature, and are the major vector for infection of humans. Transmission of flaviviruses to humans occurs during tick feeding. We have developed a first generation microarray to investigate salivary gland transcriptional changes in Ixodes scapularis nymphs during feeding or after infection with LGTV. The immediate goal of this work is to identify tick salivary gland transcripts that play a role during feeding or for the replication or transmission of TBFV. The long-term goal of this work is to identify novel tick salivary gland genes that could be targeted for the development of vaccines that have the potential to disrupt tick feeding and/or flavivirus transmission. In 2013, , we expressed several recombinant tick salivary gland proteins that were differentially expressed in LGTV-infected ticks in a baculovirus system and tested for their effect on flavivirus replication in vitro on relevant cell types such as tick and mammalian cells. There was no apparent effect on viral replication by any of the proteins in either tick or mammalian cells.  Also in 2012, we utilized a novel in vivo model for LGTV infection that mimics a tick bite by inoculating virus into the ear pinna. We injected LGTV in the presence of the same recombinant tick salivary gland proteins to see if infection were affected. No effect was observed, but genetic analysis of the virus revealed the presence of the attenuating E:D308A mutation. Comparison of TBFV biology in mammalian and tick cells. A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. We published a study comparing LGTV virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum. Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems. In contrast to mammalian cells, TBFV-infection in tick cells shows delayed and decreased membrane proliferation. Additionally, electron tomography of infected tick cells shows a shift from spherical vesicles to tubular profiles, especially in the context of persistently infected cells. In 2013, we extended these structural studies to cultures of primary embryonic brain. LGTV infection was restricted to cells of neuronal origin, and ultrastructural studies revealed results similar to those observed in mammalian cell lines, although the frequency of the tubular profiles appeared greater than in permanent cell lines. IThe viral non-structural protein 4A (NS4A), which has been implicated in the membrane rearrangements, was cloned and expressed in mammalian cells. This protein by itself was unable to induce membrane rearrangements. To facilitate expression and study of viral and cellular genes in tick cells, we modified a method of transfection and demonstrated that vectors bearing the chicken beta-actin promoter increased expression of target genes by at least 10-fold.Viral determinants of pathogenicity. Previous data collected in this lab demonstrated that upon passaging of the tick-borne flavivirus, Langat virus (LGTV), in ISE-6 tick cells, three coding mutations (M:K115E, NS3:F604L, and NS4A:A81V) arose within the LGTV genome. This virus was subsequently demonstrated to have reduced neuroinvasiveness as examined by intraperitoneal infection of three week old laboratory mice. Efforts to study the role of these mutations were confounded by difficulties inserting these mutated residues in a full length molecular clone of the TP21 strain of LGTVIn order to circumvent this problem, we developed a full length TP21 clone that contained a number of unique restriction sites in the viral sequence. This has enabled us to excise short segments of the virus, manipulate the sequence, and re-insert the mutated fragment back into the full length clone.',\n",
       " \"Studies continue to show the important role of RVs as a cause of diarrheal illnesses of infants and young children. In the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (Kotloff et al, 2013) rotavirus was the most frequent cause  (16.3-27.8%) of moderate-to-severe diarrhea  in the 0-11 month old age group at each of 7 individual sites studied in The Gambia, Mali, Mozambique, Kenya, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In addition , Walker et al in 2013 estimated that worldwide in 2011 in children less than 5 years of age, 700,000 deaths were attributed to diarrheal illnesses and RVs were the most common cause, responsible for 192,700 deaths, predominantly in the developing  regions. RVs have emerged as the single most important cause of severe diarrhea of infants and young children in both developed and developing countries in the under 5 yr age group,  RVs are  egalitarian as they infect infants and young children with similar frequency in countries with high or low socio-economic conditions but the consequences  are very different. We developed an oral, live, attenuated quadrivalent RV vaccine  to protect against the 4 epidemiologically important serotypes (G1-4).The vaccine was comprised of each of the following 4 serotypes: rhesus RV (RRV), a G3 strain, (the Jennerian approach), and 3 human RV-RRV reassortants, each possessing 10 RRV genes and a single human RV gene that encodes VP7 (a major outer shell protein) that is responsible for serotype G1, G2, or G4 specificity (the modified Jennerian approach). Following clinical studies which demonstrated the vaccine's safety, immunogenicity and efficacy especially against severe diarrheal disease, the ACIP, which advises the CDC, recommended its routine use for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. In Aug 1998 the FDA granted a Biologics License for the vaccine (RotaShield RRV-TV) to Wyeth Labs. However, in July 1999, after over one million doses had been given to an estimated 600,000 infants, the CDC recommended suspending further vaccination because post-licensure surveillance suggested that the vaccine was linked with intussusception (IS). Following additional CDC studies, in Oct 1999 the ACIP withdrew its recommendation because of additional data which supported this link. In conjunction with these events, Wyeth Labs withdrew the vaccine. However, later analysis demonstrated that age of vaccination was a critical factor in the link with IS. In the CDC case-control study, vaccinees who were 90 days of age or older at the time of the first dose developed 81% of all cases occurring within 2 weeks of vaccination, even though they received only 38% of all first doses. Thus, catch-up vaccination of older infants during the age period of high vulnerability to IS (3 or 4 to 9 months of age) contributed disproportionately. There are questions regarding the vaccine's actual attributable risk of IS, a risk estimate that has ranged widely with a consensus figure of 1 in 10,000. Because the RRV-TV vaccine was associated with a transient and characteristically low grade fever in up to about one-third of vaccinees and the knowledge that bovine RV-based vaccines were characteristically non-reactogenic, in parallel with RRV-TV vaccine studies,we had initiated studies with individual human-bovine rotavirus (UK) reassortants and found that they were safe and immunogenic. These were followed by clinical studies of the 4 reassortants combined, a formulation that represented the 4 important RV serotypes, and showed that this vaccine (BRV-TV) was also safe and immunogenic. In a Wyeth-Univ. of Tampere-NIH collaborative clinical study in Finland, in which the RRV-TV and BRV-TV were evaluated in a two-dose schedule, the BRV-TV and RRV-TV each induced a high level of protection against severe RV diarrhea over two RV seasons. The BRV-TV vaccine did not induce a significantly greater number of febrile episodes after vaccination when compared to controls whereas RRV-TV did. In addition, another Wyeth-University of Tampere-NIH  study in Finland evaluating the effect of administering RRV-TV vaccine or placebo in 3 different schedules, showed that neonates did not develop a febrile response after the neonatal dose. In addition, the neonatal dose induced significant protection against the development of a febrile response when infants received a second dose at 2 months of age. We have pursued our continued interest in RV vaccines especially for the developing countries where the toll from diarrheal diseases is immense. The NIH granted an exclusive license to BIOVIRx, Inc., a U.S. company (which was later transferred to the non-profit International Medica Foundation (IMF). This effort with RRV-TV stalled initially but was revived when funding became available from the IMF. Thus, a quadrivalent RRV-TV vaccine (RotaShield) was produced by The IDT Biologika GmbH in Germany, and became available in 2009 for clinical trial. A placebo-controlled phase II safety and efficacy trial began with RotaShield in Ghana on Aug. 28, 2009. By the end of Nov 2009 almost 1000 infants were given the 2nd dose of RotaShield or placebo: the 1st dose within the first 29 days of life and the 2nd dose before 60 days of age with a minimum interval of 3 weeks.  The study period ended at the end of November, 2010 when the final participant reached an age within two weeks of the first birthday. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses the vaccine demonstrated significant efficacy of 60.7% and 64.3%, respectively, against any RV diarrhea of any severity.  Efficacy against severe RV diarrhea with any serotype was 53.5% (ITT) and 57.6% (PP) but these numbers were not significant.  In a subset of individuals, the vaccine induced a 4-fold or greater IgA ELISA antibody response in  48% of vaccines and 0.8% of placebo recipients after dose 1 and in 56.7% of vaccinees and 3.4 % of placebo recipients after dose 2.  Efforts to implement our 2nd generation vaccine, the human RV-bovine RV reassortant vaccine (BRV) for the developing countries have advanced. The NIH OTT initially granted licenses to develop the bovine RV-based vaccine to 8 institutions, 1 in the U.S. and 7 in developing countries (Brazil, China and India). Four of the 8 have engaged in vaccine production and in various stages of early clinical trials (one of these in India was suspended- contamination- but phase I/II study of G1-G4 vaccine now completed and phase III study planned in 2014 in 2014 ; another licensee has completed phase I/II studies in India and  is planning  a phase 3 trial of a pentavalent vaccine G1-4, G9) in approx. 7500 children to begin enrollment later this year supported by PATH via the Gates Foundation; and another licensee is producing a hexavalent vaccine (G1-4, G8, G9) with support from PATH via Gates Foundation and anticipates Phase 1 trials in late 2014. Another licensee in Brazil has developed a pentavalent (G1-4, G9) vaccine and carried out phase I/II studies in adults. Another licensee in China is developing a hexavalent vaccine (G1-4, G9, P1A) vaccine.. The  manufacture of the vaccine in developing countries should result in its low cost. Our goal of vaccine implementation for the developing world has received an unsolicited boost,  with the support  to selected licensees by PATH via the Gates Foundation. A recent development has been  the licensing to PATH  for development via Gates Foundation) of an inactivated recombinant vaccine developed by Hoshino and his colleagues described as VP8  Recombinant P2-P8 delta VP8*(Wa) expressed in E coli . P2 is a universal T cell epitope of tetanus toxin. Phase I/II clinical studies have been carried out by PATH in adult volunteers. Also, another recombinant developed by Hoshino and his colleagues described as VP8 Recombinant P2-P8 delta VP8*(Wa)-P6 delta VP8* (1076) expressed in E.coli has been licensed to a lab in China.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccinia virus is used to vaccinate persons to prevent disease due to smallpox. Compared with other live virus vaccines, the smallpox vaccine is associated with frequent side effects including fever, a sore or swollen arm, headache, and fatigue. Other more serious side effects have also been reported including development of multiple lesions outside the vaccination site (generalized vaccinia), inflammation of the brain (postvaccinia encephalitis), severe infection of the skin in persons with a history of eczema (eczema vaccinatum), and disseminated vaccinia virus infection in immunocompromised persons (progressive vaccinia). Previously, we tested blood from smallpox vaccine recipients who received the Dryvax formulation of vaccine and found that 4 of 202 blood samples (from 3 of 27 vaccine recipients) were positive for the smallpox vaccine virus in the blood by PCR, but none were positive by culture. The lack of finding infectious smallpox vaccine virus in the blood indicates that the current guidelines for deferral of blood donation from smallpox vaccine recipients are appropriate. Since the study was begun, the Dryvax formulation of smallpox vaccine has been replaced by the ACAMBIS 2000 formulation.  We are now testing persons who received the ACAMBIS 2000 formulation of vaccinia and will be determining if blood samples and throat swabs might contain virus.This year, in collaboration with investigators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at Emory University, we reported a patient who developed progressive vaccinia after smallpox vaccination and cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of acute leukemia. The patient was treated with vaccinia immune globulin and two investigational drugs, ST-246 and CMX001 to slow the progression of the vaccinia virus infection and allow time for his cellular immunity to return after chemotherapy. The patient developed resistance to ST-246 during treatment. The level of virus on swabs from the skin gradually declined as his T cell function approved, and the level of vaccinia virus-specific T cells in the blood gradually declined as his infection came under control. This case demonstrated the need for careful laboratory monitoring of patients with progressive vaccinia and the need for development of new anti-poxvirus drugs to manage these diseases.In collaboration with investigators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from the University of Missouri we found that there was no evidence that poxviruses, including molluscum contagiosum virus, parapoxvirus, and orf, are associated with cases of lymphoid papulosis a skin disease of unknown etiology.',\n",
       " \"Cytomegalovirus is the leading infectious cause of birth defects which can result in deafness and mental retardation in neonates, and can cause severe viral pneumonia and colitis in transplant recipients and sight-threatening retinitis in patients with AIDS. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with a number of cancers including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Human CMV and EBV naturally infect humans, but not small animals or nonhuman primates. The best models currently available for CMV and EBV are rhesus monkey CMV and EBV. The goal of this study is to develop an effective vaccine for these rhesus viruses and to use these as a model for vaccines for their human counterparts. We are using various approaches including soluble recombinant proteins, recombinant virus vectors expressing viral proteins, and replication defective viruses as vaccines.We have been using an animal model, rhesus monkey EBV in rhesus macaques, to compare various candidate EBV vaccines.  Rhesus EBV causes a similar disease in monkeys as EBV does in humans and the viruses have the same number of virus genes that have virtually the same activities.  Last year we reported the results of a vaccine trial using a candidate rhesus EBV vaccine in rhesus macaques.  We compared the ability of soluble rhesus EBV glycoprotein gp350 with virus-like replicon particles that express rhesus EBV gp350, rhesus EBV EBNA-3A, and rhesus EBV EBNA-3B.  The soluble glycoprotein induced high levels of antibody to the virus, while the EBNA-3 proteins induced potent T cell responses.  After challenge of the animals with wild-type rhesus EBV, animals vaccinated with soluble rhesus EBV gp350 showed the best level of protection followed by animals that received VRPs expressing rhesus EBV gp350, EBNA-3A, and EBNA-3B as assessed by seroconversion or levels of rhesus EBV DNA or RNA in the blood shortly after challenge.  At 2 years after challenge, animals that received gp350 that became infected had lower levels of rhesus EBV DNA in the blood compared with those receiving the other vaccines. Since the level of EBV DNA in the blood is predictive for EBV lymphomas in transplant patients, the ability of gp350 to reduce the level of EBV in the blood of rhesus macaques after infection suggests that this vaccine might have a role in reducing certain EBV-associated cancers. Thus, the initial response to virus challenge may be predictive of the viral load years after vaccination.  We are currently studying vaccines to other rhesus EBV glycoproteins and will be immunizing animals with these vaccines and comparing them to the soluble rhesus EBV gp350 vaccine.We have also developed a candidate vaccine virus for rhesus CMV in which we deleted a protein from the virus that is essential for virus growth.  The resulting replication-defective virus lacks one viral protein, glycoprotein L (gL), and replicates only in cells expressing rhesus CMV gL. In addition, noncomplementing cells infected with the replication-defective rhesus CMV produced glycoprotein B, the major target of neutralizing antibodies, at levels similar to those observed in cells infected with wild-type virus.  We are testing this candidate vaccine in rhesus monkeys.A better understanding of the immune response is required to prevent and control virus infections and should help in the design of vaccines against herpesviruses.  We studied a woman with a history of disseminated cytomegalovirus and a very severe herpes simplex virus 2 of the perineum which was not responsive to multiple antiviral medications.  She was found to have a mutation in GATA2, a transcription factor which is critical for myeloid cell development and which is associated with low levels of monocytes, B cells, and natural killer cells.  We found that our patient had impaired NK cell function in the presence or absence of IL-2.  We treated the patient with interferon-alpha which resulted in an increase in the number of NK cells and partially restored the ability of the NK cells to kill target cells.  However, interferon-alpha did not correct the low number of NK-bright cells (the less differentiated form of NK cells).  The patient's severe herpes simplex virus infection persisted, despite interferon-alpha therapy.  Thus, while interferon-alpha increased the number of NK cells and partially improved their function, interferon-alpha did not correct the defect in NK cell development.\",\n",
       " 'Summary: Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 180 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), there are 4.1 million persons who are anti-HCV positive, 3.2 million of whom have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2011, chronic liver disease was the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. most due to chronic HCV infection. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to study. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infection is undergoing a paradigm change with the advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents. For genotype 1 infection response rates now approach 70-75%, close to that of genotypes 2 and 3. The challenging group of patients to treat are those who have failed a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin and those with advanced disease. Therapeutic options for these subjects are improving but few studies have been conducted in these patient populations. Thus studies using newer, safer and more effective therapies are urgently needed for these sub-populations with chronic HCV infection.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have created a large database of untreated patients with chronic HCV (n700) and have analyzed this database to identify factors that affect the natural history of chronic HCV infection. We have published 3 studies on this cohort, identifying clinical factors and candidate genes associated with fibrosis progression. To further define factors associated with fibrosis progression and clinical outcome of chronic hepatitis C, we prospectively monitored a large, well characterized cohort of over 1000 patients who participated in a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial of long-term peginterferon versus no therapy for patients with advanced HCV infection (HALT-C-see below) for 8 years. Important data describing the natural history of advanced chronic hepatitis C has been derived from this study. We have demonstrated that increase in weight and weight-related conditions such as diabetes and insulin resistance were associated with a greater likelihood of fibrosis progression or experiencing a clinical outcome (development of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy and variceal hemorrhage) in patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C. In contrast, regular coffee consumption was shown to be associated with a lower rate of liver disease progression. Importantly, we showed for the first time that the Ishak scoring system used to stage fibrosis, predicted clinical outcomes, need for liver transplantation, and liver-related death in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Taken together these results would allow physicians to more accurately counsel patients with hepatitis C on their risk of an adverse outcome and to provide simple, straight-forward, evidence-based lifestyle changes that may decrease their risk for disease progression. We have also combined patients from the NIH and HALT-C cohorts to examine the role of IL-28b polymorphisms on fibrosis progression and clinical outcomes. Our data suggests no association of IL28b with fibrosis progression but we did observe a higher rate of clinical outcomes in patients with IL28b CC genotype.Finally, we are validating the usefulness of a new technology, ultrasound elastography, to non-invasively assess hepatic fibrosis. Results revealed that the device has a 96% accuracy for prediction of cirrhosis. Studies are ongoing to compare Fibroscan and MRI elastography to liver biopsy, and plasma will be stored for future proteomic analysis. Our goal is to develop a series of blood and imaging test that will obviate the need for liver biopsy in most patients with chronic HCV infection.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Management options for non-responders to peginterferon and ribavirin are limited. Ribavirin, a guanosine nucleoside analogue is critically important for the success of therapy for CHC. Several post-hoc analyses and one pilot study have suggested that higher doses of ribavirin may be associated with higher rates of viral clearance. Accordingly, we have conducted an open label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose ribavirin in combination with standard dose peginterferon alfa-2a for non-responder and relapser patients with CHC. The results showed that 48% (10/21) patients achieved an end-of-treatment response and 15% (3/20) have successfully achieved long-term clearance of the virus. We have recently initiated a trial evaluating two new agents asunaprevir and daclatasvir either together or in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin to treat prior non-responders to peginterferon and ribavirin. 3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyThe conduct of clinical trials over the last 30 years has allowed the LDB to acquire invaluable clinical material (patient serum, liver tissue and lymphophocytes) to which state of the art laboratory techniques can be applied to address issues of the pathogenesis of HCV infection and the mechanisms of action of antiviral therapy. In association with the above clinical study using asunaprevir and daclatasvir we plan to study changes in interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) before and during therapy to answer two critical questions: (1) whether ISGs which are maximally upregulated in interferon non-responders can return to baseline levels and (2) whether interferon responsiveness can be restored in non-responders after suppressing viral replication with potent direct antiviral agents.',\n",
       " \"Foremost among the pathogens under study in this new project is the influenza virus, including the agents of conventional seasonal influenza, novel new strains of influenza A such as the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain that emerged in April 2009, as well as the ongoing threat of avian subtypes such as the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Novel means first to better characterize and then to treat infection with these respiratory pathogens using existing or newly developed strategies are a primary focus of this important new project within the Clinical Research Section of the LIR. The first major initiative undertaken in this project was a collaborative protocol undertaken with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) as well as the Department of Defense to determine if novel pharmacokinetic means could be used to extend the useful half-life of oseltamivir, the major licensed oral antiviral drug used to treat seasonal influenza in the United states and elsewhere and also a drug in comparatively short supply on a global scale.The pharmacokinetics proved that probenecid could be useful in extending the supply of oseltamivir in a situation of limited drug supply.The ability of oseltamivir to treat effectively severe cases of seasonal influenza may be limited, and knowledge of its utility in treating human cases of avian influenza is largely anecdotal. For these reasons NIAID launched a portfolio of clinical trials focused on the therapeutics of human influenza. One is a phase II double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted within a network of research collaborators in Southeast Asia that compared the relative efficacy of high dose versus standard-dose oseltamivir for the treatment of severe influenza and avian influenza. This trial was completed in the affected countries and showed no survival benefit to double-dose treatment. Another was a phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to evaluate the relative safety and tolerability of a novel intravenous anti-influenza agent, peramivir, in healthy volunteer subjects. This trial was initiated at the Clinical Center but then largely completed by the sponsor through a Clinical Research Organization.  An additional trial was a phase II vaccine dose-finding pilot study for the development of an anti-influenza A (H5N1) intravenous hyper-immune globulin preparation of potential utility in the treatment of human cases of avian influenza. We conducted a dose-escalating, unblinded clinical trial involving 75 subjects aged 18-59 years. No statistically significant dose-related increases in the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody were observed when the 90-microg, 120-microg, and 180-microg cohorts were compared. However, the results did suggest that a third and fourth dose of the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine may result in higher hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization GMTs, compared with the GMTs resulting from fewer doses, even if there was no apparent benefit to increasing the dose of the vaccine. In addition to these trials, we also undertook a study of a novel agent with potential antiviral activity against a variety of respiratory viruses, including influenza. In this phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical Poly-ICLC (synthetic dsRNA strands of poly-inosinic and poly-cytidylic acids), normal volunteers received escalating doses of this biologic response modifier through nasal administration. Although there were no consistent local or systemic immunologic effects that emerged, the product was both safe and well tolerated topically. Beginning with the emergence of the pandemic strain of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza in April 2009, our section also undertook additional clinical research efforts to help better characterize and treat infection with both novel and seasonal subtypes of influenza. In collaboration with LID, protocol 07-I-0229 Influenza in the Immunocompromised Host was revised to allow enrollment and study of normal volunteers in addition to patients with immunodeficiency disorders. A protocol was also developed to allow serial collection of high-titer anti-influenza plasma either from patients recovering from naturally-acquired infection or from recipients of the trivalent vaccine. The purpose is to allow harvesting of a pool of high-titer antisera (in the form of either plasma or a manufactured IVIG product) that could then be tested as a potential therapeutic adjunct in the management of patients with severe or life-threatening influenza infection. A treatment trial involving open-label administration of two units of hyperimmune plasma to hospitalized patients with severe influenza was launched domestically and has currently enrolled 25/100 patients on a multicenter basis. Most recently we have also designed an international multi-center randomized, double-blind study of hyperimmune IVIG plus standard-of-care versus standard-of-care alone in hospitalized patients with severe influenza. We have also been conducting two randomized multicenter trials internationally evaluating 1) the virologic and clinical correlation of triple combination anti-influenza treatment versus monotherapy in at-risk populations, and 2) the use of virologic assessments in measuring the effects of oseltamivir versus placebo in mild outpatient disease. Most recently we have also initiated: 1) a safety and pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers of a novel antisense compound, AVI-7100, that has activity against influenza, and 2) an open-label investigational treatment trial of parainfluenza virus infection using the novel agent DAS-181. Recruitment into the former has been brisk, but enrollment to date into the latter has been stymied by a recent lack of clinically significant disease at the Clinical Center. We continue to provide scientific and logistical support to the Mexico infectious diseases network La Red, a multi-site collaboration with the Mexico Ministry of Health designed to promote sustainability and capacity to continue clinically relevant and high-quality research on emerging infectious diseases. The five sites in Mexico City include two pediatric sites. Finally, we have also continued to contribute to the management and oversight of three large international observational protocols for outpatients or hospitalized patients with seasonal influenza infection administered under the auspices of the INSIGHT clinical trials network. The goal of these trials is to better characterize the clinical aspects of seasonal influenza infection on a global basis, to define predictors of severe disease and/or death including host genomics, to sequence and compare viral genomes on a geographic and epidemiologic basis, and to develop a repository of clinical research specimens potentially of great value in helping map viral antigenic drift, identifying emerging patterns of drug resistance, and characterizing other aspects of the evolving pandemic. Most recently these protocols have been modified to also permit enrollment of patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus infections such as that due to the MERS-CoV agent. Lastly, in addition to the clinical trials described above, we continue to 1) monitor yearly the clinical and psychologic status of a subset of patients previously exposed to anthrax as a result of the October 2001 anthrax attacks, including maintaining an open clinical protocol for the study of additional anthrax exposures that may occur through accidental or occupational exposures, and 2) support a clinical research protocol to allow the hospitalization (within the Clinical Center's Special Clinical Studies Unit) and treatment of BSL-3/4 laboratory workers potentially exposed to select agents, or of other patients exposed to emerging infectious diseases of public health importance.\",\n",
       " \"Acute or chronic non-A, B, C, D, E hepatitis is being studied for biological, serological or molecular evidence of transmissible agents. Fulminant non-A to E hepatitis remains a diagnostic enigma and may represent one or more previously unrecognized diseases. We are attempting to discover the etiology of this disease. Evidence for the existence of an additional water-borne hepatitis virus has come from our seroepidemiologic studies in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Hepatitis E virus may be emerging as a greater public health problem than previously thought.  We are studying its epidemiology in developing and industrialized countries worldwide. Serologic evidence of infection of swine with hepatitis E virus (HEV) was obtained. A new and unique HEV strain was recovered from infected swine and characterized.  It was shown to have a worldwide distribution. Seroepidemiological studies of swine handlers and matched blood donors have shown an excess of antibody to HEV in swine handlers, suggesting that the virus may be zoonotically spread. In addition, throughout FY 2009 and 2010, we have been evaluating the significance of antibody to HEV (anti-HEV) in domestic animals that are part of the human food chain, especially cattle, sheep and goats.  Anti-HEV has been found in all of the species, although not to the extent that it is found in swine.  Rarely, swine are an important zoonotic source of hepatitis E, especially in industrialized countries, but these don't account for the high prevalence of anti-HEV in Islamic and Jewish cultures.  In collaboration with XJ Meng, we are determining the susceptibility of goats to infection with the recognized HEV strains and attempting to recover HEV-like agents from young goats that are being intensively monitored for serologic and molecular evidence of infection.  Similar serologic evidence for infection of wild rats with HEV has also been obtained and the infecting agent has been identified. To date we have successfully transmitted the agent from rats trapped in Los Angeles to laboratory rats of the same species (Rattus norvegicus). However, transmission was difficult, suggesting that the virus replicates at low titer. In 2010, using PCR primers developed for detecting a new rat HEV in Germany, we were able to recover sequence from the Los Angeles strain of rat HEV that we had transmitted to other rats previously.  The sequence was very similar to the sequence of rat HEV recovered in Germany.  We have confirmed transmission of rat HEV to other rats and we have determined both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of rat HEV in several clinical samples from infected rats, including feces, serum and liver tissue.  We have documented that both the infectivity titer and the PCR titer of the virus is relatively low in these clinical materials, thus providing an explanation for difficulty in consistent transmission.  We have also confirmed by PCR that human strains of HEV were not transmissible to laboratory rats and that the rat HEV was not transmissible to rhesus monkeys, a surrogate of man.  The low virus titers detected in rats, the difficulty in transmitting the virus to rats and the inability to transmit the rat virus to a nonhuman primate species that is susceptible to infection by human and swine HEV strains leads us to conclude that the rat virus probably does not pose a threat of zoonotic infection to humans.Modern techniques of molecular biology have been used to discover new viruses in recent years. These are now being applied to sera from patients with transfusion-associated or community-acquired hepatitis in a search for new hepatitis viruses that may cause up to 2% of such hepatitis in the US and up to one-third of hepatitis in developing countries. In addition, a significant number of cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer remain undiagnosed.  In an attempt to increase the sensitivity of virus discovery, we are applying microarray technology to attempts to transmit new agents to chimpanzees, the only species other than man that is susceptible to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses. Preliminary results are promising. Similarly, approximately one half of nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases have no recognized etiology.  In collaboration with the Epidemiology Section, LID, we are applying the same approaches to attempts to identify new gastroenteritis agents. In FY 2009, while evaluating the innate and adaptive immune responses of chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected with hepatitis E virus (HEV), we discovered an aberrant innate immune response in two chimpanzees that had been infected with HEV from an outbreak of hepatitis E in Pakistan.  Based on extensive experience with innate and adaptive immune responses to all five recognized human hepatitis viruses in chimpanzees, we postulated that the response in these animals was to a second agent replicating in the liver.  By attempting transmission from the second innate immune response episode to new chimpanzees, we demonstrated evidence for an infection not related to hepatitis E in the original infection.  It has been associated with only minor biochemical evidence of hepatitis, but that is also true for HEV infection of chimpanzees.  We plan to determine if this putative agent produces more severe infection on serial passage and whether it can be associated with hepatitis or other liver disease, such as liver cancer.  Liver cancer is a common sequela of infection with three of the five recognized human hepatitis viruses.In 2010, we attempted to identify an etiologic agent in clinical materials from one of the chimpanzees with evidence of infection with a possible new hepatitis agent.  Clinical samples were tested on the  virus Chip  being utilized at the time under the NCI contract with SAIC.  Although, based on sequences detected, several viruses were found to be infecting the chimpanzee, none was found to be unique to the acute phase sample but not the pre-infection sample.  Subsequently, both pre-infection and acute phase plasma samples from the chimpanzee were subjected to  next-generation  deep sequencing with  454 technology.  Both sequences of known virus families (in some cases the same as those detected by the virus Chip) and unique sequences were detected.  These are currently being subjected to in-depth analysis to determine if they include one or more previously unrecognized viruses.In 2011 we have continued to refine extraction and amplification techniques for the identification of new hepatitis viruses from primate-derived clinical materials, in anticipation of additional  next-generation  sequencing experiments.  Known viruses of known titer have been used as controls to optimize procedures.In other collaborative studies, the epidemiology of emerging norovirus infections among children were studied in stored clinical samples obtained between 1975 and 1991.  Evolutionary analysis revealed that norovirus genotype GII.3 viruses evolved at a rate comparable to that of other small RNA viruses and that these viruses evolve at a relatively steady state.  Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of prevalent noroviruses is relevant to the development of effective prevention and control strategies.In 2012 we studied rat HEV strains originally discovered in Germany and found that they naturally infected rats in Los Angeles.  Attempts to infect rats with human HEV strains and to infect nonhuman primates with rat strains indicated that rat HEV is probably not a threat to humans.In 2013 we extended our use of Next-Generation Sequencing technology (Illumina, 454) to search for new hepatitis viruses.  In addition, we found evidence for the existence of a new HEV in goats; this may have implications for zoonotic disease.  Because Dr. Purcell, the PI retired, this project was terminated.\",\n",
       " 'Although the study subjects were seronegative to the hemagglutinins in the vaccine viruses and were predicted to be susceptible to infection with the pLAIVs because the HA and NA genes were derived from novel influenza virus subtypes from avian/animal species, the vaccine viruses were highly restricted in replication. The immune responses to the pLAIVs were variable, ranging from high seroconversion rates to H9N2 and H7N3 to low seroconversion rates for H5N1, H6N1 and H2N2 vaccines. In order to pursue a live attenuated influenza vaccine strategy for influenza viruses with pandemic potential, it is important to learn more about factors that determine the level of replication of the pLAIV strains in seronegative healthy adults and factors that determine whether a vaccine recipient will develop an immune response to the vaccine. In FY13, we undertook a study to identify biomarkers that would that predict shedding and immune response to live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines. This study would address the following questions: (1) Which biomarkers predict whether seasonal or pandemic LAIV replicate in the respiratory tract of healthy adults? (2) Which biomarkers predict whether seasonal or pandemic LAIV will elicit an immune response in healthy adults? These studies are in progress.We had previously evaluated H5N1 and H7N7 live attenuated influenza A virus vaccines in Phase I clinical trials at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Rochester; unfortunately, few vaccinees shed virus and/or seroconverted by hemagglutination inhibition or neutralization. However, a proportion of the vaccinees had other evidence (e.g. B cell ELIspot) of an immune response to the vaccine. We sought to determine whether the vaccinees were immunologically primed, and if so, would have a strong boost in their immune response to an inactivated H5 or H7 vaccine. This study would address the following questions: (1) Is there evidence of immunologic priming with a live attenuated H5N1 or H7N7 influenza virus vaccine that was highly restricted in replication and poorly immunogenic? (2) Does the H5N1 or H7N7 live attenuated influenza virus vaccine prime for an enhanced (and/or broad) immune response to the unadjuvated H7N7 inactivated virus vaccine? The analysis of the data from these studies is in progress.',\n",
       " 'The response of intrinsic brain cells to virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS) can influence virus infection in the brain and the clinical outcome of disease. Our studies have focused on two animal models of virus-mediated neuropathogenesis to determine the host response proteins that regulate disease induction. We have identified several host response proteins that are upregulated in the CNS following neurovirulent retrovirus infection or bunyavirus infection and may influence neuronal damage.In 2013, we primarily focused on examining the role of the innate immune response in mediating neuronal death during virus infection.  Our previous studies with primary neuronal cultures indicating that stimulation of neurons through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) resulted in neuronal death.  We examined a similar pathway during virus infection and identified a molecule SARM1 (sterile alpha and TIR-containing motif 1) as a mediator of LACV-mediated neuronal death.  Neurons deficient in SARM1 had reduced virus-induced cell death despite similar virus levels.  Similar results were observed in vivo with SARM1-/- mice.  Examination of the mechanism of SARM1-mediated cell death demonstrated SARM1 localization to the mitochondria, induction of oxidative stress response and mitochondrial damage.  Induction of SARM1 during LACV infection was dependent of the RIG-I/MAVS pathway, but was independent of the type I IFN response.  These studies indicate that activation of anti-viral signaling mechanisms in neurons can lead to neuronal damage through the upregulation of SARM1.  Targeting SARM1-mediated cell death may be useful in limiting neuronal damage during virus infections.',\n",
       " 'Background: We aim to understand the degree and duration of protection induced by HIV treatment killing of malaria parasites (called infection-treatment vaccination or ITV, alternatively referred to as chemoprophylaxis vaccination or CVac), and the role of such ITV in acquired, malaria specific anti-infection immunity in the field. We also aim to study the effects of HIV treatments on malaria transmission.Naturally acquired immunity to malaria only develops after a number of disease episodes, and is imperfect as it fails to protect against infection.  Blood stage (BS) malaria infection, which is the stage associated with malaria clinical symptoms, may prevent anti-infection immune responses. In contrast, complete protective anti-infection immunity is induced with attenuated malaria parasites that arrest during liver stage development. Anti-infection immunity is also observed in mice that are infected with wildtype sporozoites (the infective form of the parasite) and then given drugs that kill LS parasites, and in humans that are infected with wildtype parasites while receiving chloroquine, a drug that kills BS parasites. Also, chemoprophylaxis studies in endemic areas likely failed to induce anti-infection immunity as the drug regimens employed may have permitted BS exposure. Taken together, these data indicate that exposure to LS parasites and avoidance of BS infection can induce highly effective anti-infection immunity.  Pre-clinical data show that HIV protease inhibitors (HIV PIs), but not non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have anti-BS activity, but effects on LS parasites require further study.  Separately, the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) reduces clinical malaria episodes presumably from an anti-BS effect, but whether an anti-LS effect occurs and how this may contribute to anti-infection immunity is unknown. ITV-like effects might occur in naturally exposed populations who are receiving HIV treatments with antimalarial effects.  Also, because these drugs are taken continuously, they may be more likely to attenuate LS and prevent BS infection via constant pressure, although the degree of effect will likely depend on transmission intensity and host immunologic status. Separately, HIV PIs have been shown to affect sexual stage parasites (gametocytes), but their effects on later stage gametocytes and mosquito stage parasites  (TS) remains unknown.  Also, while other antifolates may not kill gametocytes but do kill mosquito stages, effect of TMP-SMX on TS requires further investigation.We hypothesize that 1) HIV PIs and TMP-SMX will kill LS and TS parasites at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs), that is, concentrations achieved in the serum of patients on standard dosing regimens; 2) the use of drugs with LS-killing effects will contribute to acquisition of anti-infection immunity in areas where African children who receive these treatments; and 3) HIV treatments with TS-killing effects will contribute to reduced transmission.Based on these hypothesis, we propose the following projects and summarize our accomplishments:PROJECT 1: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria liver stages (LS) and anti-infection immunity in vitro and in animal models at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs).Significance: Because each of these HIV treatments are used in malaria-endemic areas, we believe our in vitro and animal data will provide evidence for further investigation of HIV treatment effects in the field.  HIV treatment regimens (choice, and in the case of TMP-SMX prophylaxis, duration) could be tailored for patients in malaria-endemic areas if these drugs reduce malaria burden. Major Findings/Progress: 1) The HIV PI lopinavir, and the antimicrobial TMP-SMX, but not the NNRTI nevirapine, kills P. falciparum LS in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs) and 2) Repeated exposures to live sporozoites with TMP-SMX prophylaxis induces development anti-infection, sustained, stage-specific immunityPROJECT 2: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria gametocytes, mosquito stages, and transmission in vitro.Significance:  HIV-infected patients population (especially those with more severe immunocompromise) have higher parasite burdens and more frequent malaria. HIV treatments that reduce transmission may contribute to reduced malaria burden at a community level. Major Findings/Progress: The HIV PI lopinavir, but not the NNRTI, nevirapine, kills gametocytes (A) and mosquito stages (B) of P. falciparum in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations (CRCs). TMP-SMX does not kill gametocytes, but kills mosquito stages at CRCs.PROJECT 3: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria infection incidence and anti-infection immunity in HIV-infected or HIV-exposed, uninfected African children.Significance: Currently, the World Health Organization recommends HIV management with antiretroviral therapy (ART): first line regimens include an NNRTI (in children, nevirapine) and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with few exceptions, and second line regimens include an HIV PI (in children, lopinavir-ritonavir) and 2 NRTIs. Separately, TMP-SMX is used in HIV-exposed, uninfected children in resource-limited settings for extended durations because children in such settings breastfeed out of necessity, which poses a continued risk for HIV transmission.  Extending or curtailing the duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis has been a source of debate due to concerns over development of antibacterial TMP-SMX resistance.  If any drugs used in HIV management are deemed to have an effect in reducing the clinical burden of malaria, either by direct drug-parasite killing effect on LS or TS, or via an ITV-like induction of immunity, their use may become tailored to maximize parasite killing and protective anti-infection immunity, and to minimize transmission. Major Findings/Progress: Our observational substudy examining HIV PIs vs. NNRTIs (in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network, or IMPAACT) has reached full enrollment at 3 sites, and these children have now been followed for over 2 years.  Samples processing as well as data analysis is ongoing.  Separately, our study examining TMP-SMX effect on malaria infection and anti-infection immunity is in planning stages.PROJECT 4: To examine the impact of HIV treatments on malaria transmission in HIV-infected or HIV exposed, uninfected African children. Significance:  HIV treatments may impact malaria parasite transmission in the community.  If certain HIV treatments contribute to reduction of transmission, their use may become standardized (i.e., HIV PIs preferentially used in malaria endemic areas) or timed to capitalize on such effects (i.e., TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-uninfected children extended).Major Findings/Progress:  Our observational substudy (examining HIV PIs vs. NNRTIs) has reached full enrollment and these children have now been followed for over 2 years.  Samples collection and processing as well as data analysis is ongoing.  Our study examining TMP-SMX effect on malaria infection and anti-infection immunity is in planning stages.',\n",
       " 'An experimental animal model in which the course of immunodeficiency virus infection parallels the pathogenesis of the human disease is critical for the study of human AIDS. SIV induces an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected macaques that is remarkably similar in pathogenesis to human AIDS. An important use of this animal model system is the detailed study of pathogenesis and viral determinants of disease since many studies of this type are not feasible in humans. The purpose of this project is to investigate host and viral factors involved in variable disease progression in SIV-infected macaques and the lack of disease in African primates infected with their own strains of SIV.PATHOGENESIS OF SIVsm-INFECTION OF MACAQUES.&#8232;To investigate the role of host factors in SIV-infection of macaques, we used a well-defined molecularly cloned virus (SIVsmE543-3), two macaque passages from the original sooty mangabey host. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that PBMC of individual macaques show vastly different susceptibility to SIVsmE543-3 infection in vitro and susceptibility is predictive of subsequent plasma viremia following inoculation. Our recent studies identified that allelic polymorphisms in the SPRY domain of TRIM5 alpha gene are responsible for much of this variation. In contrast, SIVmac appears to be adapted for resistance to rhesus macaque TRIM5. We evaluated the effect of restrictive TRIM5 alleles (TRIM-TFP and TRIM-CypA) on viremia in SIVsmE543-3-infected rhesus macaques. Restrictive genotypes were associated with significantly lower viremia than in macaques with the permissive genotype, and emergence of escape mutations in the SIV capsid protein. Two amino acid substitutions (P37S and R98S) in the capsid region were associated with escape from TRIM5TFP restriction. Introduction of these mutations into the original SIVsmE543 clone resulted in escape from TRIM5&#945; restriction in vitro and improved virus fitness in macaques with homozygous restrictive TRIMTFP alleles in vivo. Similar substitutions were observed in other SIVsm strains following transmission to macaques, collectively providing direct evidence that TRIM5&#945; exerts selective pressure on the cross-species transmission of HIV/SIV in primates. Full length infectious clones of the related challenge stock, SIVsmE660 have also been generated by close to full length RT-PCR from the virus stock. Three of these viruses replicate efficiently in rhesus PBMC in vitro and were very sensitive to neutralizing antibody (equivalent to Tier 1 classification used for HIV-1. All three are sensitive to the TRIM-TFP allele but two have mutations in the cyclophylin A binding loop that confer resistance to TRIM-CypA. Two clones were evaluated for in vivo viral replication and pathogenesis rhesus macaques following intravenous inoculation. Both clones resulted in robust and persistent viremia that was associated with significant loss of CD4+ memory T cells. Evolution of the V1 and V4 regions was associated with escape from neutralization. We have created a panel of chimeric viruses expressing later stage envelopes that range in neutralization sensitivity from Tier 1 to Tier 3 that will be evaluated in macaques as a potential challenge strains following low dose challenge.  In addition, mutations associated with escape from TRIM-TFP have been introduced into one of the original clones and this will be evaluated in macaques in vivo.SIV and HIV are both associated with the development of encephalitis. For HIV, the onset of AIDS dementia is generally a late stage finding. In contrast, most models of SIV encephalitis (SIVE) use animals that progress rapidly to disease. We observed a small number of rhesus that developed SIVE over a more protracted course. Studies of the evolution of SIV revealed that terminal virus from the brain and plasma were phylogenetically distinct, consistent with compartmentalization during development of neuroAIDS.  We have performed sequential intravenous passage of virus isolated from the brain of rhesus macaques with SIV encephalitis and derived a viral swarm, SIVsmH804E that induces SIV meningitis and/or encephalitis at high frequencies. We assessed viral populations in the meninges and the brain parenchyma by laser capture microdissection and observed compartmentalization of viral populations between the meninges and the parenchyma. Our results suggest that virus in the CSF may not be representative of viral populations in the brain and that caution should be applied in extrapolating between the properties of virus in these two compartments.ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION OF NATURAL HOST SPECIES. A second goal of this project is to study the mechanisms underlying the lack of pathogenicity of SIV for their natural host species, with emphasis on SIVagm from vervet monkeys. The maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms. There are a number of distinctive features of natural infection with SIV including: 1) low numbers of CD4+ T cells, 2) low expression of CCR5 at mucosal sites; 3) lack of chronic immune activation; 4) existence of a population of CD4- T cells that appear to function as helper cells but are resistant to SIV infection; and 5) low levels of maternal to infant transmission.In a collaborative study with the Brenchley lab, we found that many of the CD4+ T cells from African green monkeys down-regulate CD4 in vivo as they enter the memory pool and that this occurs independent of SIV infection. These CD4-negative memory T cells maintain functions that are normally attributed to CD4 T cells; however lack of CD4 expression apparently protects these activated cells from infection by SIVagm in vivo. Thus the absence of SIV-induced disease progression in natural hosts species may be partly explained by preservation of a subset of T cells that maintain CD4 T cell function while being resistant to SIV-infection in vivo. We have conducted small-scale breeding of SIVagm-infected AGM using pair housing; this has been successful with the production of 14 infants over a six-year period. None of these infants became infected despite being nursed by their infected mothers for a year following birth. We have initiated studies of SIVagm infection in three infant AGM (1 year of age) in collaboration with the Brenchley lab. There was no adverse clinical consequence of infection in all three infants with normal kinetics of viremia observed. Our future studies will focus on mucosal transmission of SIVagmVer and studies of the role of alternative coreceptors in addition to CCR5 for entry of SIVagm in AGM. In an initial pilot experiment with two adult AGM, we used a repetitive low dose intra rectal challenge scheme with dose escalation. Unexpectedly one AGM became infected readily at the lowest dose after two inoculations whereas the other AGM required nine inoculations and the use of 100 fold more virus. We are currently evaluating the viruses that were transmitted in these two AGM using Single genome amplification (SGA) and comparison to the inoculum. Previous studies of SIVsm infection of sooty mangabeys have shown that this virus uses an alternative coreceptor to CCR5 for infection ofin sooty mangabeys in vivo. Since AGM characteristically express very low levels of CCR5 on CD4+ T cells, it is possible that SIVagm this may be a common theme among natural hosts species. Initial studies using the CCR5 inhibitor, Maraviroc did not block infection indicating the use of alternative coreceptors in this virus model.',\n",

       " '(1) To develop animal, especially nonhuman primate, models that mimic human disease:In 2012-2013 two viruses emerged in the human population that caused severe respiratory disease with high case fatality rates: influenza A virus subtype H7N9 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To better understand the pathogenicity of Influenza A virus H7N9, cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013, a strain obtained from a fatal human case. Animals developed a transient, moderate pneumonia with virus replication occurring throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract. Clinical signs in the cynomolgus macaques were less severe than those observed in the majority of human cases of influenza A virus H7N9 infections. This likely reflects the importance of underlying medical conditions, observed in the majority of past and current human cases of H7N9 infection, for the development of severe or lethal infection with this virus (De Wit et al., in preparation). In attempt to develop an animal disease model for MERS-CoV that could be used for efficacy testing of countermeasures, we first inoculated Syrian hamsters with MERS-CoV. However, hamsters were not susceptible to infection showing no signs of disease nor seroconversion (de Wit et al., PLoS ONE 2013). Rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection. Clinical signs, virus shedding, virus replication in respiratory tissues, gene expression and cytokine and chemokine profiles peaked early in infection and decreased over time. MERS-CoV caused a multifocal, mild to marked interstitial pneumonia, with virus replication occurring mainly in alveolar pneumocytes (Munster et al., New Engl J Med 2013).(2) To identify and characterize determinants of pathogenicity in animal models:To better understand the features that define highly lethal influenza viruses, we exploited a technology for the artificial generation and modification of influenza viruses (reverse genetics system). Using this technology, we have generated a consensus pandemic H1N1 virus (parent virus). In order to study virulence of the different strains and the mechanisms of pathogenesis we have generated selected recombinant viruses and characterized those mutants in vitro. For this we have compared the genome sequences of two early circulating pandemic H1N1 strains with different pathogenicity in humans (M4108, M4487). Sequence comparison revealed amino acid changes in 5 genome segments, PB2, PA, HA, NP and M. The recombinant viruses were generated on the background of M4108 by replacing the corresponding genomic segment. We have characterized the recombinant viruses in vitro and found preliminary evidence for a role of PB2 and PA. The in vivo studies are currently ongoing. The ferret model was attempted first, but the parent viruses did not significantly differ in disease outcome to make this model useful for our research question. We are currently investigating the use of a mouse model for this work (Tsuda et al, in preparation). Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. This seems also be the case with the latest pandemic H1N1 virus. In order to study a potentiating effect of influenza and bacterial co-infection we performed a co-infection study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 followed by MRSA showed enhanced clinical disease (Kobayashi et al, in preparation). Similar studies were performed with a seasonal H3N2 virus and MRSA, in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement (Kobayashi et al., Virulence: in revision).(3) To identify potential targets for intervention:In a first attempt to identify new targets for intervention we have performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of acute host responses to infection with pandemic H1N1 (Ca04) in mice, macaques and swine. We observed differences in inflammatory molecules elicited, and the kinetics of their gene expression changes across these species, including genes regulated by nuclear receptor signaling molecules controlling lipid and metabolic processes impacting inflammatory responses to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. While the heterodimeric retinoid X receptor (RXR) signaling pathway was differentially regulated during infection in each species, divergent expression of lipid-binding molecules and NF-kappaB molecules was observed across species. By comparing transcriptional changes across hosts in the context of clinical and virological measures and integrating evidence from transcription factor analyses, we were able to examine similarities and differences in acute host responses to pandemic H1N1 influenza infection across hosts (Go et al., BMC Genomics 2012). Targeted testing of potential antiviral agents against the newly emerged MERS-CoV is ongoing. This includes the identification of interferon-alpha2b and ribavirin as potentially effective antiviral agents against MERS-COV when used in combination in vitro (Falzarano et al., Sci Rep 2013). A follow-up study in the rhesus macaque model has indicated that combination treatment is effective at reducing clinical disease, evidence of pneumonia, pathology and inflammatory markers (both locally and systemically) (Falzarano et al., Nat Med: provisionally accepted 8/20/2013). In collaboration with the Molecular Targets Program at NCI, griffithsin, a novel viral entry inhibitor, was identified as having potent (EC50 5nM) activity against MERS-CoV and efficacy testing in the rhesus macaque model is scheduled. Additional antiviral drugs have also been tested in vitro with nitazoxanide showing a selectivity of approximately 10. An efficacy assessment in rhesus macaques is planned pending delivery of pharmacokinetic data in the rhesus macaque. We have also recently received additional compounds to investigate in vitro including interferon-beta and the cyclophilin inhibitors DEB025 and NIM811. Results from in vitro studies are pending.(4) To develop vaccines and test their efficacy in the developed animal models:In order to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses we are currently applying an approach based on two observations: i) highly conserved B cell epitopes are present within two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk region, and antibodies against them affords heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region can increase antibody responses against other normally poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus vector platform for these studies, which is able to induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody) following a single vaccination. The vectors have been made and we are currently testing immunogenicity. The project title needs to be changed to better reflect the current and future work on this project. We would suggest changing as follows: Disease Modeling of Influenza and Other Emerging Respiratory Viral Pathogens.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and caused up to 18,000 deaths in the U.S. and up to 575,000 deaths globally. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Efforts to identify pre-1918 influenza virus RNA-positive autopsy material are continuing. Possible fatal influenza pneumonia cases from 1907-1917 have been identified in tissue archives and anonymized materials are being screened for host and viral RNA by RT-PCR. A second effort underway has been to characterize the noncoding regions of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus to complete the viral genome using a novel RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-based approach.  Finally, a method has been developed allowing high-throughput deep sequencing of host, viral, and bacterial RNA from a 1918 autopsy tissue sample.  This method significantly reduces ribosomal RNA allowing sequence analysis of viral and host mRNA expression and identification of secondary bacterial infections.',\n",
       " 'CD8+ T-cells play a crucial role in eradicating viral infections. The focus of this project is two-fold. First, to study general in vivo mechanisms of virus - host interactions and second, to understand how primary and memory T-cells respond to virus infection.  Despite the importance of T-cells, we do not yet fully understand the induction of a CD8+ T-cell responses and the generation of CD8+ T-cell memory to virus infection. For viruses in which traditional vaccine approaches have not been successful, it is hoped that induction of CD8+ T-cell memory will enhance immunity. To induce optimal CD8+ T-cell responses to vaccines it is necessary to understand how primary CD8+ T-cells are stimulated. This project aims to address questions related to the optimal and activation of T cell immunity following primary and secondary virus infection by studying several viruses and different routes of infection.  This year our studies examining a poxvirus skin infection have demonstrated distinct roles for innate and adaptive immune cells in virus clearance.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually.  Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses continue to circulate enzootically in poultry in many countries and continue to cause human infections. Recently a novel avian H7N9 strain emerged in China also causing human infections and fatalities. A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to model host adaptation, map viral virulence factors and host factors in disease progression, evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines were performed.Understanding the origin, virulence, and pathogenic properties of the 1918 virus, is crucial for current public health preparedness and future pandemic planning. The origin of the 1918 pandemic virus has not been resolved, but its coding sequences are very like those of avian influenza virus.  Recent work with 1918:low pathogenicity avian influenza H1N1 chimeric viruses suggested that the virulence factor(s) in the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) gene might be shared with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses expressing H1 HAs.  Work is ongoing to assess experimental mouse pathogenicity with low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses with all 16 subtypes.  These viruses are also serving as challenge strains in experiments designed to evaluate influenza viral-like particle (VLP) vaccines.Previous work showed that a neuraminidase N1 VLP vaccine, derived from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, could protect mice given a lethal highly pathogenic H5N1 virus challenge.  In follow-up studies done in collaboration with Dr. Maryna Eichelberger at the FDA, neuraminidase (NA) immunity was further studied. Twelve NA amino acids essential for MAb binding to the NA of a recent seasonal H1N1 virus were mapped using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).  Several of these residues were recognized by strain-specific mAbs, while several other residues were within conserved epitope(s), allowing cross-reactive mAbs to bind the NAs of seasonal H1N1 and the 1918 and 2009 pandemic (09pdm) H1N1 as well as H5N1 viruses. A single dose of mAbs administered prophylactically fully protected mice against lethal challenge with seasonal and 09pdm H1N1 viruses and resulted in significant protection against the highly pathogenic wild-type H5N1 virus.  The identification of conserved N1 epitopes reveals a molecular basis for NA-mediated immunity between H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and demonstrates the potential for developing broadly protective NA-specific antibody treatments for influenza.Influenza A virus infection leads to variable and imperfectly understood pathogenicity. We recently reported that segment 3 of the virus contains a second open reading frame ( X-ORF ), accessed via ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift product, termed PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF and functions to repress cellular gene expression. PA-X also modulates IAV virulence in a mouse infection model, acting to decrease pathogenicity. Loss of PA-X expression leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response, which notably includes increases in inflammatory, apoptotic, and T lymphocyte-signaling pathways. Studies on the role of PA-X in influenza virus replication and pathogenesis are ongoing.In a collaboration with Dr. Paul Digard at the University of Edinburgh, another novel protein product of influenza A viruses was identified, in segment 7 of the virus. Serial passage of an influenza virus lacking the M2 mRNA2 splice donor site identified a single nucleotide pseudoreverting mutation, which restored growth in cell culture and virulence in mice by upregulating segment 7 mRNA4 synthesis rather than by reinstating mRNA2 production.  The mRNA4 was shown to encode a novel M2-related protein (designated M42) with an antigenically distinct ectodomain that can functionally replace M2.',\n",
       " 'The arthropod-borne viruses within the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family are important human pathogens, causing outbreaks of meningoencephalitis in humans in many regions of the world with fatality rates between 10 and 50%. Flaviviruses are transmitted in nature to various mammals and birds through the bite of an infected mosquito or tick and include mosquito-borne Dengue, WN, Japanese encephalitis, SLE, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. WN and SLE are endemic in North America, and WN is the major cause of viral encephalitis in the USA. During the 1999-2011 outbreaks, there were at least 31,414 reported human cases of WN illness that resulted in 1263 deaths. Since 2004, there was a steady decrease in incidence of WN disease; then in 2012, WN virus resurgence produced 5,674 human infections including 2,873 cases of neuroinvasive disease and 286 deaths. The upsurge of human WN infections suggests that the US can expect periodic WN outbreaks in the coming years. No established specific antiviral therapy or a licensed human vaccine is available to date to treat and prevent SLE and WN diseases. Tick-borne encephalitis is a severe neurologic disease affecting thousands of people throughout Eurasia. Despite the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines in endemic areas, an increasing incidence of TBEV during the past 2 decades emphasizes the need for an alternative vaccine that will induce a more durable immunity and protection against TBEV. In an effort to develop the efficacious live attenuated vaccines against neurotropic flaviviruses, we explored several strategies, and progress toward this goal in the past year is reviewed below.    The live attenuated TBEV or WN vaccine candidates are being developed in the Neurotropic Flaviviruses Section of the LID using a strategy based on the chimerization of a neurovirulent TBEV or WN with a non-neuroinvasive dengue-4 flavivirus (DEN4) and the introduction of attenuating mutations or targets for cellular microRNAs (miRNAs). The introduction of a 30 nucleotide deletion in the 3non-coding region (3NCR) of chimeric TBEV/DEN4 or WN/DEN4 genome that contains the structural protein genes of a highly virulent TBEV or WN has a significant attenuating effect on neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, and pathogenesis in adult mice. However, in a more susceptible animal model such as newborn or immunodeficient mice or monkeys, TBEV/DEN4d30 exhibited a high level of neurovirulence in the CNS compared to that observed for widely used yellow fever 17D vaccine virus. Further attenuation of TBEV/DEN4 was required since a live vaccine against neurotropic virus should be fully restricted for replication in the CNS.    The discovery of miRNAs, small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of cellular genes, has enabled us to use a novel strategy to modulate virus tropism and selectively attenuate its pathogenesis. We explored the ability of the CNS-expressed microRNAs to modulate the neurotropism and pathogenesis of flaviviruses. The inclusion of a single target for the brain tissue-expressed miRNAs into the TBEV/DEN4 genome was sufficient to prevent the development of otherwise lethal encephalitis in adult mice. However, we found that the efficacy of miRNA-mediated inhibition of virus replication in the immature CNS of suckling mice depended on the genetic stability of the miRNA-targeted virus that can revert to a virulent phenotype. In FY2012, we demonstrated that multiple site miRNA-targeting of flavivirus genome in the 3NCR strongly attenuated the virus neurovirulence and pathogenesis in the developing mouse CNS. Importantly, virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression occurs exclusively through the deletion of inserted miRNA-targets and results in the loss of the viral genome sequence located between the two most distant miRNA targets. These findings offer a general strategy to control the virus escape and reversion to a virulent phenotype: simultaneous miRNA-targeting of the viral genome at many different functionally important regions (5NCR, ORF, and 3NCR) could prevent virus escape from miRNA-based attenuation. In FY2013, two strategies have been tested to explore whether miRNA targeting of viral genome at the ORF could attenuate virus neurovirulence: (1) the replacement of viral genome sequence with mir-124 sequence in the regions of their homology identified in E, NS3, or NS5 gene and (2) the insertion of miRNA-targets between the viral genes. With the first strategy, genome sequence replacements always led to amino acid changes in the proteins making virus recovery unpredictable or resulting in inefficient virus replication or insert instability.  In the second approach, a set of miRNA-targets was introduced between the TBEV E and DEN4 NS1 genes of the TBEV/DEN4 genome. Insertion of three target copies for mir-124 miRNA or three target copies for mir-9 and mir-124 miRNAs between these genes resulted in the attenuation of virus neurovirulence for newborn mice. However, similar to the viruses carrying miRNA-targets in the 3NCR, these viruses escaped from the miRNA-mediated inhibition through the deletion of miRNA targets.  To further increase the level of miRNA-controlled suppression, we explored the effect of the simultaneous miRNA-targeting of viral genome in the 3NCR and sites between the E and NS1 genes. A set of four viruses that contained three targets for mir-124 miRNA or mir-9 and mir-124 miRNAs between the E and NS1 genes and three targets for mir-124 miRNA in the 3NCR have been generated. Combining the miRNA-targeting in the ORF and 3NCR  had an additive effect on reducing neurovirulence of the TBEV/DEN4 virus since no death or neurological signs were observed in newborn mice inoculated in the brain with 100 or 1000 LD50. Thus, a possible solution to eliminate the flavivirus replication in the CNS and completely prevent the emergence of escape mutants is to target the functionally essential regions of the viral genome; a deletion of the target genomic sequences located between the inserted miRNA binding sites would be lethal for the virus.In FY2013, we developed new alternative TBEV vaccine candidates using an infectious cDNA clone of a naturally attenuated, tick-borne Langat virus (LGT). This project was initiated to generate LGT-based TBEV vaccines that might provide greater humoral and cellular immunity against TBEV than our lead candidate based on the DEN4 genetic backbone. Chimeric TBEV/LGT virus bearing the structural protein genes of TBEV retained the level of peripheral virulence observed for its attenuated LGT parent in mice. Using multiple site miRNA-targeting, we abolished or restricted the TBEV/LGT replication in the brain. In FY2014, we plan to exploit hematopoietic system-specific miRNAs and limit virus dissemination in the periphery by inserting targets into the viral genome for miRNAs expressed in the cells of its primary replication: e.g., dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages.    A live attenuated WN vaccine (WN/DEN4d30 virus) developed in the NFS was found to be well-tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response in healthy adult volunteers in Phase I clinical trials at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. The clinical, virology, and histopathology data for neurovirulence and neuropathogenesis in rhesus monkeys obtained in FY2013 suggest that the WN vaccine virus is sufficiently attenuated for the CNS as compared to YF 17D vaccine and support the further large-scale clinical trials in humans, including the at-risk group of elderly volunteers. We will continue the basic research directed toward the understanding of viral neuropathogenesis and cellular biomarkers and pathways in the antiviral response associated with infection by neurovirulent (WN) or attenuated (YF 17D and WN vaccines) flaviviruses in the nonhuman.',\n",
       " \"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the world, causing serious complications on women's reproductive health including ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics, and pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infections in different population settings, including populations in resource constrained countries. In a multi-center international trial, we screened a total of 18,014 participants at baseline, 15,054 at 12 months, and 14,243 at 24 months for a variety of STDs using non-invasive molecular amplified assays. The incidence of chlamydia in men was 2.0 per 100 person years and 4.6 in women across the 5 countries. A high prevalence and incidence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections was identified among men and women in a wide variety of settings, prompting the need for more effective programs to identify and treat chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. We have used the Internet, www.iwantthekit.org, to offer sampling in Maryland and other areas in the U.S. for chlamydia screening in 4,500 women and over 2500 men using self-obtained vaginal swabs or self-obtained penile-meatal swabs. Prevalence for chlamydia for women has been 7.5% overall for women, and 15.3% in young women age 15-19 yr. Both young age and Black race were statistically associated with chlamydia positivity. For men, the overall prevalence has been 9.1%. Over 21% were positive for at least one STD with acceptance for collecting penile swabs being very high.    Trachoma due to C. trachomatis infection is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the world.  The WHO has recommended that three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics be offered to control the disease in districts where the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is &#8805;10% in children aged 1-9 years, with treatment coverage of at least 80%. We have participated in both surgical and antibiotic treatment intervention studies in Gambia, Niger, and Tanzania in efforts to control trachoma. To evaluate a point of care molecular diagnostic for field use we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and field utility of the Cepheid GeneXpert C. trachomatis assay for ocular chlamydia infection compared to Roche Amplicor assay. In a trachoma-endemic community in Kongwa Tanzania, 144 children ages 0 to 9 were surveyed to assess clinical trachoma and had two ocular swabs taken. Of the 144 swabs taken the prevalence of follicular trachoma by clinical exam was 43.7%, and by evidence of infection according to Amplicor was 28.5%. The sensitivity of GeneXpert for C. trachomatis when compared to Amplicor was 100% and the GeneXpert test identified more positives in individuals with clinical trachoma than Amplicor. The GeneXpert test for C. trachomatis performed with high sensitivity and specificity and demonstrated excellent promise as a field test for trachoma control.     To determine whether infection recurs after mass treatment, we re-examined individuals in Tanzania five years after initiation of the program. Treatment coverage was 80% for all ages in the first year. At five years, clinical trachoma rates were lower than at baseline, ranging from 45% compared to 81% at baseline. The prevalence of trachoma decreased in a linear fashion with number of years of mass treatment, and decreased prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was related to the extent of the previous years azithromycin coverage. Our model suggests that, for communities with baseline trachoma prevalence of 50% and annual treatment coverage of 75%, >7 years of annual mass treatment will be needed to reach a prevalence of trachoma of <5%. In a sub-study of the Tanzania program, all children under 9 years in 4 villages were followed from baseline pre-mass treatment to six months post treatment. 1,991 children under nine years were enrolled in the longitudinal study. Baseline infection was 23.7% and at 6 months was 10.4%, despite 95% coverage. Infection at baseline was positively associated with infection at 6 months (OR = 3.31, 95%CI 2.40-4.56) and treatment had a protective effect (OR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.25-0.80). The age group 2-4 years had an increased risk of infection at 6 months. The household characteristics predictive of infection at 6 months were increasing number of children infected in the household at baseline and increasing number of untreated children in the household.None of the intervention communities met criteria to stop MDA. There was no difference in infection (2.9% vs 4.7%; P = .25) between the usual care and cessation rule communities at 18 months. In this setting, communities with low (10%-20%) initial prevalence of active trachoma did not have MDA stopped before 3 annual rounds on the basis of monitoring for infection. Infection with C trachomatis in communities with average trachoma rates at 12% to 13% cannot be eliminated before 3 rounds of MDA with azithromycin.     In a companion study in Gambia the baseline prevalence of TF and of Ct infection in the target communities was much lower at 6.5% and 0.8% respectively. At 36 months the prevalence of TF was 2.8%, and that of Ct infection was 0.5%. No differences were found between the arms in TF or Ct infection prevalence either at baseline, or at 36 months. The implementation of the stopping rule led to treatment stopping after one round of MDA in all communities in both SR arms. Mean treatment coverage of children aged 0-9 in communities randomized to standard treatment was 87.7% at baseline and 84.8% and 88.8% at one and two years, respectively. There was no evidence of any difference in TF or Ct prevalence at 36 months resulting from enhanced coverage or from one round of MDA compared to three. Thus the Gambia is close to the elimination target for active trachoma, whereas Tanzania will require prolonged MDA. In districts prioritized for three MDA rounds, one round of MDA reduced active trachoma to low levels and Ct infection was not detectable in any community. There was no additional benefit to giving two further rounds of MDA. Programs could save scarce resources by determining when to initiate or to discontinue MDA based on testing for Ct infection, and one round of MDA may be all that is necessary in some settings to reduce TF below the elimination threshold.\",\n",
       " 'Models for the ultimate development of effective vaccines and immunotherapies that would limit HIV replication can be drawn from naturally occurring examples of immune system-mediated control. Identifying the components, targets, and magnitude of an effective immune response to HIV are important steps toward developing effective vaccines and immunotherapies. Although patients with normal CD4+ T cell counts and low levels of plasma virus are a heterogeneous group, a small subgroup of patients with truly non-progressive HIV infection and restriction of virus replication likely holds important clues to the basis of an effective immune response to HIV. A small subpopulation of HIV-infected individuals (fewer than 0.8%) shows no signs of disease progression over a 10-year period. We have assembled a stringently defined cohort of such patients, termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs), or elite controllers. Many of these patients have been infected for 20 years, yet even without receiving antiretroviral therapy, they have experienced no CD4+ T-cell decline and have maintained plasma viral RNA levels below 50 copies per milliliter. We are using cells from these patients to systematically dissect the mechanisms of immune-mediated restriction of virus replication. The HIV-specific T-cell responses of these patients have been studied in extreme detail. Through this project, considerable progress has been made in understanding how the immune system controls HIV. Our prior work indicated that there is a dramatic association between immunologic control and the HLA B*5701 allele, and that the immune response is highly focused on peptides restricted by this allele. This result established both host genetic and functional links between immunologic control and the CD8+ T-cell responses of these patients. The finding of high frequencies of CD8+ T cells specific for the patients virus in both LTNPs and progressors strongly suggested that differences between responses of these patient groups were qualitative rather than quantitative in nature. One important qualitative difference in the HIV-specific immune response that distinguishes LTNPs from progressors is the maintenance of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells with a high proliferative capacity. This proliferation parallels perforin expression required for effective killing of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. To better understand the mechanisms of immunologic control, we devised a method to measure HIV-infected cell elimination on a per-cell basis. Measured on a per-cell basis, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs efficiently eliminated primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. This effective killing was clearly distinguishable from the responses of progressors over a very broad range of effectors to HIV-infected targets. Progressor cells did not mediate effective killing even at high effector-to-target ratios. Defective cytotoxicity of progressor effectors could be restored in vitro. These results establish an effector function and a mechanism that clearly segregate with immunologic control of HIV.One of the original goals of our work in LTNP was to provide insights regarding important elements of the cellular immune response that should be induced in vaccination. Although cytotoxic capacity clearly distinguishes those with immunologic control in the setting of chronic infection, it may not necessarily be the operative mechanism in control induced by an HIV vaccine. Previously, direct measurements of recall cytotoxic capacity assessed by granzyme B target cell activity and infected CD4+ T-cell elimination had not been applied to recipients of HIV vaccines. We recently examined the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity of HIV-1-uninfected recipients of the Merck Ad5/HIV trivalent vaccine. A very high profile efficacy trial employing this vaccine was the Step study, a phase IIB test-of-concept trial involving 3,000 HIV-negative individuals at high risk of HIV infection. We observed that the ability of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8+ T cells to kill primary autologous HIV-infected targets was relatively low and not comparable to responses we have previously associated with immunologic control. These findings suggest that the relatively poor ability of this vaccine to reduce viral loads upon natural infection is potentially attributable to the relatively poor induction of cytotoxic capacity.  The next step in this project is to determine whether cytotoxic capacity is predictive of the ability to control HIV in the few vaccinees that exhibited control of the virus upon natural infection.We have recently extended our observations in humans to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus(SIV)-infected Rhesus macaque model.  This is the most widely used primate model of HIV infection and offers the possibility of studying cytotoxic capacity in a model where there are excellent examples of immunologic control, either spontaneous or following vaccination.  In addition this model offers the possibility of studying the causal relationships between cytotoxic capacity and immunologic control in a manner that cannot be pursued in humans.A subset of SIV-infected rhesus macaques behave as LTNP manifesting similar features of effective immune system-mediated control of lentiviral infection. MHC class I alleles are associated with control of SIV infection, particularly Mamu B*08 and B*17. The CD8+ T cells of LTNP carrying these alleles preferentially recognize Mamu B08 and B17-bound SIV epitopes.  Furthermore, the 2-4 log increase in SIV plasma viremia seen after in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion in both LTNP and progressors in vivo provides further support that SIV is controlled by the CD8+ T cell response in these animals.  Although the study of non-human primates has resulted in important advances for understanding HIV-specific immunity, a clear correlate of immune control over SIV replication had not been found.In 2013, CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity was examined to determine whether this function is a correlate of immune control in the rhesus macaque SIV infection model as has been suggested in chronic HIV infection. SIVmac251-infected CD4+ T-cell clone targets were co-incubated with autologous macaque effector cells to measure infected CD4+ T-cell elimination (ICE). Twenty-three SIV-infected rhesus macaques with varying plasma viral RNA levels were evaluated in a blinded fashion. LTNP had greater median ICE than progressors (67.3% 22.0-91.7% vs. 23.7% 0.0-58.0%, p=0.002).  In addition, significant correlations between ICE and viral load (r= -0.57, p=0.01), and between granzyme B delivery and ICE (r=0.89, p<0.001) were observed.  Furthermore, the CD8+ T cells of LTNP exhibited greater per-cell cytotoxic capacity than those of progressors (p=0.004). These findings suggest that greater lytic granule loading of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and delivery of active granzyme B to SIV-infected targets are associated with superior control of SIV infection in rhesus macaques, consistent with observations of HIV infection in humans.  Therefore, such measurements appear to represent a correlate of control of viral replication in chronic SIV infection and their role as predictors of immunologic control in the vaccine setting should be evaluated.Taken together our work suggests that cytotoxic capacity is a clear correlate of immunologic control of HIV in chronic infection and may also be an important immune correlate in vaccinees. In addition, the greater cytotoxic capacity induced in vaccine trials among participants with protective alleles is consistent with associations between MHC alleles and viral load in vaccinees. Over the coming years we are optimistic that this work will provide a long-sought after T cell correlate of immunity that will predict immunologic control of HIV and, in the process, accelerate HIV vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'Antigenic and genetic characterization of the novel influenza A H1N1 virus indicated that the virus contained a unique combination of gene segments from North American and Eurasian lineages of swine influenza viruses. The viruses isolated from human cases of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus infection were antigenically homogeneous and antigenically similar to North American swine H1N1 viruses, but distinct from seasonal human influenza A H1N1 viruses.  The swine-origin hemagglutinin (HA) was closely related to the HAs of pre-1947 human H1N1 viruses but highly divergent from the HAs of recently circulating H1N1 strains. Consequently, prior exposure to pH1N1-like viruses was mostly limited to individuals over the age of about 60 years. In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Rochester, we related age and associated differences in immune history to the B cell response to an inactivated monovalent pH1N1 vaccine given intramuscularly to subjects in three age cohorts: 18 to 32 years, 60 to 69 years, and>70 years.In FY13, we completed the analysis of the samples collected from the clinical trial. The day 0 pH1N1 specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) titers were generally higher in the older cohorts, consistent with greater prevaccination exposure to pH1N1-like viruses. Most subjects in each cohort responded well to vaccination, with early formation of circulating virus specific antibody (Ab)-secreting cells and >4-fold increases in HAI and MN titers. However, the response was strongest in the 18- to 32-year cohort. Circulating levels of HA stalk-reactive Abs were increased after vaccination, especially in the 18- to 32-year cohort, raising the possibility of elevated levels of cross reactive neutralizing Abs. In the young cohort, an increase in MN activity against the seasonal influenza virus A/Brisbane/59/07 after vaccination was generally associated with an increase in the anti- Brisbane/59/07 HAI titer, suggesting an effect mediated primarily by HA head-reactive rather than stalk-reactive Abs. Our findings support recent proposals that immunization with a relatively novel HA favors the induction of Abs against conserved epitopes. They also emphasize the need to clarify how the level of circulating stalk-reactive Abs relates to resistance to influenza.In collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University and the University of Rochester, we also compared the heterovariant B-cell response induced by the monovalent inactivated 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 vaccine with that induced by the 2009 seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (sTIV) containing a seasonal influenza A virus subtype H1N1 component in young and elderly adults. Plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAb) from young and elderly recipients of pH1N1 vaccine or sTIV were tested for binding activity to various influenza antigens. In pH1N1) vaccine recipients, the PPAb titers against homotypic pH1N1 vaccine were similar to those against the heterovariant seasonal H1N1 vaccine and were similar between young and elderly subjects. The PPAb avidity was higher among elderly individuals, compared with young individuals. In contrast, the young sTIV recipients had 10-fold lower heterovariant PPAb titers against the pH1N1 vaccine than against the homotypic seasonal H1N1 vaccine. In binding assays with recombinant head and stalk domains of hemagglutinin, PPAb from the pH1N1 recipients but not PPAb from the sTIV recipients bound to the conserved stalk domain. Thus, the pH1N1 vaccine induced production of PPAb with heterovariant reactivity, including antibodies targeting the conserved hemagglutinin stalk domain.In addition to the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV), administered by intramuscular injection, a live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine is licensed for healthy adults 2-49 years of age. This vaccine is administered by nasal spray. Neutralizing antibody in the serum has been found to be a correlate of protection for TIV, but the immune correlates of protection for LAIV are not known. Defining the origin and nature of transcriptional responses to LAIV in upper respiratory tract will be a highly informative first step in a systems approach toward understanding the molecular basis of viral replication restriction and the regulation of the local mucosal immune responses following LAIV administration. In FY13, in collaboration with colleagues at Stanford University, we undertook a natural history study using a systems biology approach to identify LAIV replication niches among a variety of URT cell types and characterize the host immune response to LAIV. Data analysis is in progress.',\n",
       " 'Objective (A) Arenaviruses: Lassa virus isolates from Mali are less virulent then classical isolates, and in macaques disease progression was atypical with primarily pulmonary disease manifestation (Safronetz 2013). Our results suggest that clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Mali may be atypical, which might explain the low incidence of disease in this region. Bunyaviruses: We have characterized two animal models for the study of Sin nombre virus; an infection model in Syrian hamsters (Safronetz 2013) and a disease model in macaques (Safronetz, submitted). Using the novel nonhuman primate model we performed the first temporal characterization of the pathophysiology of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and identified several key factors, including viremia, hematological abnormalities and tissue specific immune dysregulation in the development of this rare but frequently fatal disease. The ability of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus to infect animals without causing overt disease signs has hampered research into human disease. We have developed a model using interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice, which closely mimics human CCHF. The IFNAR-/- mouse model is the first animal model for studying disease progression and countermeasures (Zivcec 2013).   Filoviruses: We have developed and characterized a novel small animal model for Ebola virus infection. The Syrian hamster displays almost all hallmark features of human disease including coagulopathy. This is likely to replace current small animal models for Ebola virus research (Ebihara 2013).Paramyxoviruses: We have compared two strains of Nipah virus in the Syrian hamster model. Both strains cause similar disease and pathology with enhanced disease progression for the Malaysian strain. (DeBuysscher 2013). We performed a spatio-temporal analysis of Nipah virus entry into the CNS of Syrian hamsters and showed that Nipah virus rapidly enters the CNS via the olfactory route (Munster 2013). In collaboration we have further defined henipavirus pathogenesis in human respiratory epithelial cells (Escaffe 2013).Objective (B) Bunyaviruses: We have continued our efforts to evaluate and characterize newly designed adenovirus-based CCHF vaccines expressing the nucleoprotein or glycoproteins of CCHF virus. Neither vaccine vector alone provided complete protection, but nearly complete protection could be achieved with a blended approach and complete protection could be achieved through booster immunizations. Ongoing transfer and depletion studies indicated that antibodies are the mechanism of protection of these vaccine vectors (Zivcec, in preparation).Filoviruses: We have investigated the mechanism of protection of the recombinant Vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) based Ebola vaccine in nonhuman primates. Depletion studies demonstrated that neutralizing antibody responses are critical for the efficacy of the vaccine (Wong 2012; Marzi 2013). Furthermore, we have evaluated the protective efficacy of live or inactivated rabies-based Ebola vaccines expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein in a nonhuman primate model. Protection was achieved with all vaccination approaches using a prime/boost strategy. Protection is largely dependent on the quality of the humoral immune response (Blaney 2013). All our vaccine efforts were summarized and discussed in a recent review article (Falzarano & Feldmann 2013). We have further characterized and investigated the role of antibodies to different proteins of Ebola and Marburg virus (Changula 2013). Interestingly, non-neutralizing antibodies to the glycoprotein of Marburg virus inhibited the budding of live virus and thus, present a potential treatment strategy (Kajihara 2012, 2013).  Paramyxoviruses: We developed rVSV-based Nipah virus vaccines expressing either the nucleoprotein (N), fusion protein (F) or glycoprotein (G) of Nipah virus, strain Malaysia. Efficacy studies were performed in the Syrian hamster model and showed that the F and G protein expressing vaccine vectors provide full protection in this animal model. Current ongoing studies support the notion that the humoral immune responses are critical for vaccine efficacy (DeBuyscher, in preparation). Objective (C) Bunyaviruses: We are currently characterizing the immune response to hantaviruses in their natural hosts. For this we have started experiments using our in-house deer mouse colony, the reservoir for Sin nombre virus (North American hantavirus). We have established Andes virus (South American hantavirus) infection in deer mice (not the natural reservoir) and compared it to Sin nombre virus infection in these animals (deer mouse is the natural reservoir). In contrast to Sin nombre, which persistently infects deer mice, Andes virus infection is efficiently cleared by deer mice. We have found that deer mice mount an anti-inflammatory response to Sin nombre virus allowing for persistence, but mount a strong inflammatory response to Andes virus (Spengler 2013). It is thought that hantaviruses cause disease via an immunopathogenic mechanism. To examine this, we have performed T cell depletion in hamsters, a model for human disease. Depletion did not alter the pathogenicity or replication of Andes virus indicating that pro-inflammatory T cell responses do not contribute to disease (Prescott 2013; Schountz 2013).Objective (D) Bunyaviruses: We tested the effect of favipiravir against Andes and Sin nombre virus replication in the established lethal Syrian hamster model. We concluded that favipiravir treatment is beneficial for postexposure prophylaxis against HPS-causing hantaviruses (Safronetz et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2013). Filoviruses: Ribavirin can effectively extend the time-to-euthanasia of hamsters infected with Ebola virus, but as observed in cell culture appears to rapidly develop resistance that is either viral or cellular based. Doxycycline and 5-fluoruracil have shown some activity against Ebola in vitro. A novel platelet activating factor inhibitor (WEB2086) has been show to partially protect hamsters when given following challenge. Following optimization of the treatment schedule, in future combinde treatment with ribavirin and/or other agents will be attempted (Chen  2013; Hoenen 2013; Falzarano, ongoing). In the past year we have further intensified our work with recombinant Ebola viruses to study virus biology (Hoenen 2012; Groseth 2013; Shabman 2013), as well as used them to develop a novel platform for rapid antiviral screening (Hoenen 2013). We will continue the work with recombinant Ebola viruses in order to gain further insights into virus biology, and are now in the process of moving this work into animal models to study pathogenesis. Cellular cysteine proteases are proposed to play an important role in Ebola virus replication. We tested Ebola virus replication in cathepsin B & L knockout mice and conclude that other proteases can substitute for cathepsins making it difficult to use proteases as antiviral targets (Marzi 2012). We have studied the mechanism of Ebola virus RNA editing. Studies have identified primary and secondary structural requirements and a potential role for VP30 as a necessary factor for RNA editing. (Mehedi, in press). Objective (E) Arenaviruses: Our continuous ecological studies have further defined endemic areas for a unique Lassa virus, Soromba R, in Mali (Safronetz, in preparation). We have started breeding Mastomys natalensis in order to generate a colony for experimental work in the natural reservoir of Lassa virus. Bunyaviruses: In collaboration we have developed a new indirect immunofluorescence assay for the detection of antibodies against clinically relevant hantaviruses (Lederer 2013), which will be helpful for our field work.',\n",
       " 'In accordance with NIHs decision to discontinue chimpanzee research we have completed and closed the corresponding animal protocols.Project 1: Innate and adaptive immune responses after low-dose exposure to HCVHCV-specific T-cell responses in the absence of viremia and HCV-specific antibodies have been observed in individuals who are thought to be frequently exposed to HCV antigens such as family members of HCV-infected patients (J Immunol. 1999;162:6681-9), health care workers (J Infect Dis. 2013;208:1020-5) and researchers (J Infect Dis. 1997;176:859-66) and a subpopulation of some injection drug users (J Infect Dis. 2008;198:203-12).  It has been proposed that these T cell responses confer immune protection against HCV infection. We tested this hypothesis by repeatedly exposing chimpanzees to low amounts of HCV (human plasma or PBMC that tested positive for HCV by RT-PCR below the detection limit of the standard clinical assay at the NIH) and then challenging them with standard-dose HCV to assess protective immune responses. We found that HCV-specific T cells were induced in the low-dose HCV-exposed chimpanzees but not in a control chimpanzee exposed to plasma and PBMC from healthy blood donors. One of the low-dose HCV-exposed chimpanzees developed persistent viremia when HCV-specific T cell responses waned, the others maintained their T cell responses and remained aviremic.  The immune profile of the aviremic chimpanzees was extensively characterized and was reminiscent of the immune status of subgroups of injection drug users, health care workers and family members of chronic HCV patients who are frequently exposed to low-level HCV but test HCV RNA and antibody negative.  These chimpanzees were subsequently challenged with standard-dose HCV to assess the protective nature of these T cell responses in blood and liver. The experimental studies have been completed and the chimpanzees have been released from the protocol.  The virological and immunological analyses of the preserved blood and liver biopsy samples are ongoing.Project 2: Immunotherapy of chronic HBV and HCV infectionAlthough a vaccine exists to prevent new HBV infection, there is no cure for those patients who are already chronically infected. Antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogues that inhibit the viral reverse transcriptase does not eliminate HBV that persists in host cells in the form of closed circular DNA and continues to produce infectious virus.  Continuous antiviral treatment is therefore necessary, and over years results in the selection of HBV escape mutants that render further treatment with antivirals ineffective.   Chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the consequences.  On the other hand, HBV can be cleared by the host immune response in the acute phase of infection and a very small percentage of patients (1%) is able to clear the virus spontaneously in the chronic phase.  Spontaneous HBV clearance is mediated by vigorous T cell responses that recognize HBV-infected hepatocytes and either lyse them or cure them of HBV in an IFN-gamma-mediated manner.  HBV-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies then persist for decades and continue to exert immunosurveillance.  In contrast, the number of HBV-specific T cells is low and their function is impaired in chronic infection. To date, it has not been possible to induce new, functional virus-specific T cells in chronic infection via vaccination or other measures.To test the hypothesis that successful HBV-specific T cell responses can be restored in chronic HBV infection, and to assess the fate of the adoptively transferred T cells in the liver, we have previously expressed a chimeric, antibody-based receptor (CAR) to HBsAg (Gastroenterology 2008;134:239-244) in blood lymphocytes from blood lymphocytes that were obtained from chimpanzees with chronic HBV infection. Upon transduction these lymphocytes gained a broad spectrum of HBV-specific effector functions (secretion of IFN-gamma, cytotoxicity and proliferation). After in vitro expansion to high numbers we have now infused them into chimpanzees with chronic HBV infection and obtained blood and liver biopsy samples to assess their effect on viral load and their fate in the liver. In parallel, chimpanzees with chronic HCV infection were treated with T cells that were transduced with T cell receptors from animals that successfully cleared HCV infection. As in HBV infection, a vigorous CD8 T cell response is required to spontaneously clear HCV and to maintain long-lasting protective immunity against reinfection. Blood and liver biopsy samples were obtained to assess the T cells effect on viral load and their fate in the liver.  In a final part of the study, the response of the transferred HCV-specific T cells was boosted by administering a candidate vaccine.  The experimental studies have been completed and the chimpanzees have been released from the protocol.  The virological and immunological analyses of the preserved blood and liver biopsy samples are ongoing.Project 3: Identification of early immunological biomarkers for the outcome of HCV infectionUsing serial blood and liver biopsy samples from chimpanzees that had previously been infected with HCV genotype 1a several years ago (Major et al., Hepatology 2004; 39:1709-1720) we investigated whether the outcome of HCV infection can be predicted early on by the phenotype of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells.  CD8+ T cells are typically exhausted and overexpress inhibitory molecules in chronic HCV infection, but it is not known whether this is the cause or consequence of HCV persistence.  To answer this question it is important to study very early time points after infection, when these T cells first appear in the blood and to also assess the immune response in the infected organ, the liver.  In this project we demonstrated that the early expression of the memory precursor marker CD127 on HCV-specific T-cells, but not the expression of inhibitory molecules on those T-cells or their ligands in the liver, inhibitory cytokines or Tregs, predict the outcome of acute HCV infection.  The experimental studies have been completed and the chimpanzees had already been released from the protocol years ago.  The virological and immunological analyses of the preserved blood and liver biopsy samples have been completed.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to active immunity (preventive vaccines) and passive immunity (monoclonal antibodies) directed against HIV that are conducted by the VRC Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center. The clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines include: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. Beginning in FY13, we are also investigating the use of highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against HIV.  A brief summary of each study to date follows.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5): p. 601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12): p. 1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published Vaccine, 2007. 25(20): p. 4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) was a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed. A manuscript describing results from VRC 008 study was published: PLoS One, 2013; 8(4):e59340.VRC 009 (05-I-0081) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLoS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p. 1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) was a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed.  The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 016 (11-I-0197) is a Phase Ib descriptive study to evaluate the kinetics and pattern of early innate and adaptive immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, alone and after priming with DNA vaccine.  This study was developed and initiated in FY11 and remains ongoing during FY12.  HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase 2b efficacy study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed in collaboration with the Division of AIDS and HVTN and designed to see whether or not the vaccines have efficacy in prevention of HIV or an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who acquire HIV infection during 2 years of follow-up. Study enrollments were completed in FY13.  Study vaccinations were discontinued in April 2013 based on DSMB recommendations when study results showed that prospectively defined efficacy futility criteria had been met.  Long term follow-up is ongoing.VRC 602 is under development as the first Phase 1 study to evaluate a highly neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed at the CD4 binding site on HIV.  The study is on track to open in 4th quarter 2014.',\n",
       " '1.Orthopoxvirus pathogenesisA goal of EVPS is to understand virus-host interactions and exploit them for countermeasure development. Here, we sought to build on our previous experiments using a systems kinomics approach to characterize the host cell response to MPXV strains of varying virulence and to investigate similarities and differences between variola virus and MPXV to identify host targets for development of therapeutics. We are collaborating with the CDC Poxvirus and Rabies Branch (and associated WHO approval) to determine the functional host response to variola virus (VARV) insult by employing temporal host kinome analysis. Several studies have demonstrated that pharmacological targeting of cellular processes may inhibit the VARV lifecycle. Understanding how VARV modifies the host environment will allow us to both characterize the molecular host response to VARV infection and identify novel host targets for therapeutic intervention. The resultant kinome data differed significantly between the VARV and monkeypox virus (MPXV) and specific targets were verified through western blot analysis.  Based on the data we have analyzed >80 kinase inhibitors for anti-poxvirus activities when added prior to, or subsequent to, viral infection. We have also performed bioinformatics analysis of VARV and MPXV data sets with focus on those derived from THP-1 monocytes and have performed: 1) Analyses for phosphorylated kinase targets that drive the differential hierarchical clustering of the VARV and MPXV data sets (top 5, 10, 25 and 50 hits) 2) Functional network analysis across all data sets to identify broader biological networks that are modulated by VARV or MPXV infection and 3) Upstream regulator network analysis to identify biological therapeutic targets for VARV and MPXV. We have also continued our studies of orthopox pathogenesis in nonhuman primates. Previously, we had established that infection of rhesus macaques with cowpox virus (CPXV) resulted in a disease that resembled human hemorrhagic smallpox, a rare and nearly 100% lethal disease associated with secondary bacterial infections. We compared the impact of antibiotic treatment on disease progression. 8 NHPs were IV inoculated with CPXV, 4 were treated with antibiotics, 4 were not. We did not observe a difference in onset of clinical signs or outcome between the groups. We did observe some differences in clinical parameters such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel serum chemistry values. We also altered the route of inoculation of CPXV in macaques to determine if small particle aerosol results in disease that more closely resembles human smallpox. We observed an LD100 and LD50 and disease progression was different than IV inoculation and did not result in hemorrhagic signs or secondary bacterial infections. We also performed chest CT to evaluate lung progression for further development of medical imaging techniques for use in infectious disease studies. Our studies indicate the route of inoculation influences disease outcome and we plan to follow up with large particle aerosol which would alter the depth of penetration and may also alter disease progression. Our third project studying orthopox pathogenesis is based on our Backwards Matched Longitudinal Analysis which identified several cytokines that were statistically associated with lethal or non-lethal outcome in NHPs. The duration and intensity of certain cytokines was associated with survival (IFN-gamma and RANTES) or non-survival (MCP-1). The role of these cytokines was investigated using recombinant virus expressing each cytokine and knockout mice of the cytokine or its receptor. MCP-1 expressing virus and MCP-1 and MCP-1 receptor knockout mice had increased pathogenicity when compared to wild type virus. IFN-gamma expressing virus did not develop disease, and knockout of INF-gamma or its receptor resulted in increased pathogenicity. The MCP-1data suggests that macrophages are essential for controlling infection, but excessive MCP-1 alter macrophage function which may exacerbate disease. We plan follow up studies with MCP-1 inhibitors to determine if modulating host response is a viable platform for future anti-orthopox therapy. Mice inoculated with interferon gamma expressing virus did not develop any signs of disease and survived lethal challenge at the equivalent 100% lethal dose of wild type virus. We are planning to follow up to determine if expression of interferon gamma at the site of infection via a recombinant virus results in protection from challenge with the LD100 of wild type virus.  2. Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and Ebola virusWe have previously developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University. Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced cellular and humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. We evaluated our vaccine candidates in a rhesus macaque challenge model. 100% protection was observed with live attenuated RABV-GP. The inactivated and RVdelG-GP viruses provided 50% protection.  Strong humoral and cellular immunity was observed. In summary, our findings indicated that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, and RVdelG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use. 3.Filovirus Molecular Virology We employed temporal kinome analysis to investigate the host kinome responses to EBOV infection in human hepatocytes. Analysis of our kinome data demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-mediated signaling responses were temporally modulated in response to EBOV infection. ELISA analysis of TGF-beta secretion from mock- or EBOV-infected cells demonstrated that up-regulated TGF-beta secretion correlated with the up-regulation of TGF-beta-mediated signaling. These results were further confirmed through the use of kinase inhibitors targeting cell receptors or downstream signaling pathway intermediates identified from our kinome analysis inhibited EBOV replication. In addition, kinase inhibitors targeting these signaling pathways provided a degree of protection in a lethal EBOV murine model of infection. We are also investigating the role of phosphorylation of the viral proteins in the virus lifecycle. We have chosen to focus on VP35 as it is essential for transcription and replication of the genome. Using a replicon system we have generated point mutations and clustered point mutations of potential phosphorylation sites and evaluate the mutant for replication and transcription. Our data indicates a hierarchical phosphorylation strategy that regulates VP35 function. A third project involves identification of host proteins that interact with the non-coding regions of the EBOV genome.  Using Gel Mobility Shift RNase T1 protection Assays we have identified 8 regions within the Leader and Trailer elements that interact with host proteins. We are working to identify the proteins. We have identified HSC70 as interacting with at least one domain in the EBOV Trailer by pull-down assays and confirmed using IP-RT-PCR. Three HSC70 binding domains have been identified within the EBOV Trailer and mutational analysis of the 5 most region results in a decrease in replicon signal. We have also undertaken SHAPE analysis of the EBOV Trailer to define the secondary structure of the EBOV Trailer. Based on these data we may identify therapeutic targets as well as establish mechanisms of filovirus lifecycle regulation.',\n",

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune competence as a factor of treatment efficacy in Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The main drawbacks for a wider application of treatment of long-term T. cruzi infections include the difficulty of assessing treatment efficacy and the potential adverse effects of these therapeutics. Likewise, treatment regimens in terms of doses and duration in chronically T. cruzi-infected subjects are still debated. Conversely, drug therapy in T. cruzi-infected children is considered to be more effective than in adult patients. The aim ofthis application is to determine the association between the immunological status prior to treatment and the rate of cure following either complete treatment with benznidazole or interrupted treatment due to adverse effects. The prediction is that subjects with polyfunctional Tcell responses to T. cruzi pre-therapy have higher chances to achieve cure compared with those displaying a narrower range of T cell functions. Furthermore, shortened treatment regimens are predicted to be effective in cases where immune responses are strong prior to treatment. Based on extensive preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories, these hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the association between the quality of T cell responses prior to drug therapy and success of treatment with benznidazole, and further validate non-conventional parameters as markers of treatment efficacy in T. cruzi-infected children; and 2) Compare treatment outcomes between complete and incomplete treatment schedules in T. cruzi-infected adults and children treated with benznidazole. Under Aim1, pretreatment immune responses specific for T. cruzi will be determined in infected children and stratified based on the capacity of T cells to exert monofunctional or polyfunctional T cell responses as determined by ELISPOT and flow cytometric assays. Then, treatment efficacy after benznidazole administration will be assessed by the achievement of complete seronegative conversion by conventional serological tests (i.e. the accepted standard of treatment success and cure in Chagas disease) and determine if treatment success is associated with a highly functional T cell profile prior to treatment compared with patients in which treatment fails. In addition, we will follow these treated subjects (irrespective of prior quality in T cell responses) with our previously reported surrogate parameters of treatment efficacy (i.e. T cell cytokine ELISPOT technique and multiplex serological assay) to determine whether patients who achieve cure show changes in immune responses post-treatment considered to reflect parasite clearance; as well as to identify the earliest changes that can be associated with cure. An observation of such association would further validate these metrics for monitoring treatment outcomes. Under the second aim, we will assess whether an incomplete course of treatment preferentially provide cure in those individuals who had more highly functional parasite specific T cell responses prior to therapy. Changes in T and B cell responses by non-conventional measures of treatment efficacy will be also compared between patients receiving full doses of benznidazole vs. those who received incomplete treatment regimens to evaluate the usefulness of these parameters to measure efficacy in cases of interrupted treatment. The proposed study is innovative in that it represents a departure from the current therapeutic approaches, namely the notion that improving host immune responses to T. cruzi could enhance treatment efficacy. These contributions will be significant because it will expand our understanding of how drug treatment works and provide guidance on how to most effectively treat and monitor therapy outcomes in chronically infected individuals.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previous influenza pandemics have resulted in 50-100 million deaths worldwide, while seasonal influenza viruses cause between 3000 and 50,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations per year in the US alone. The recent emergence of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N9 strains and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic emphasize the continuing threat to human health and national security posed by pandemic influenza. To address this threat, annual universal vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged over 6 months in the US. Current vaccines include inactivated trivalent split or subunit and live attenuated vaccine, both of which have the drawback that they must be grown using laborious methods in eggs and reformulated every year based on the influenza strains predicted to be prevalent in the next flu season. However, the major disadvantage of these vaccines is a surprising lack of effectiveness, which was highlighted in a recent meta analysis of influenza vaccine (live and inactivated) in the US. Even in the recent 2012-13 season in which the vaccine was well-matched to circulating strains, only 59% efficacy was achieved, casting doubt on the long- standing belief that a close match between the vaccine and circulating strains results in high effectiveness. There is an urgent need for the development of highly effective and cross-protective influenza vaccines and new rapid methods of manufacturing. To meet this need FluGen has developed a novel vaccine virus (M2SR) based on the deletion of the M2 gene. This deletion in the viral genome allows for single replication of the vaccine virus in the host an production of viral proteins, which induces strong cross-protective immunity without the generation of progeny virions (shedding), a goal unmet by current vaccine strategies. The M2SR is a platform backbone virus that can be modified to encode the viral antigens from any influenza strain and is produced in a novel cell culture system, avoiding the use of eggs. We hypothesize that M2SR will provide safe, highly effective, broad spectrum, long-lasting protection against influenza. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis and show that the vaccine elicits strong systemic and mucosal immune responses and provides effective cross-reactive protection against lethal challenge with influenza. We will test this hypothesis in 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1. To determine the efficacy and spectrum of protection afforded by the M2SR vaccine. We will further investigate the efficacy and longevity of protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenge. Aim 2. To evaluate the safety profile of the vaccine. Lung histology and the inflammatory response will be assessed after vaccination and challenge. We will also conduct a toxicology study and determine the effect of pre-existing influenza infection on the vaccine. Aim 3. To determine the mechanism of heterologous protection. We will investigate the role of virus-specific T and B cell responses in cross-protection. Aim 4. To determine how the vaccine impact susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection. These studies will provide a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the M2SR vaccine.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop a safe and efficacious virus-like particle (VLP) based-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine to prevent the disease caused by this pathogen. The respiratory illnesses provoked by RSV in infants, children and the elderly are of global economical and public health impact. A recent worldwide estimate [5] indicates that over 33 million children under the age of five suffer RSV associated lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and at least 3 million are hospitalized and approximately 199,000 die of the disease each year. In the US, the CDC estimates that there are over 126,000 RSV associated pediatric hospitalizations at a cost of over $900 million per year. There is no vaccine currently licensed and treatments for the disease are limited; a prophylactic intervention relies on administering a neutralizing monoclonal (Synagis) to infants at risk of infection and to supportive care. A safe and effective vaccine would be the most desirable and cost effective preventive intervention. However, to date the creation of such a vaccine has not been attained and its development hindered by the enhancement of disease provoked by a formalin-inactivated vaccine produced in the 1960's. Other approaches have not proven successful and even dangerous. Here, we propose to develop and test a virus-like particle displaying RSV antigens as a strategy to create a safe and effective RSV vaccine. VLPs are mimics of wild type virus particles but do not contain viral genetic material making them unable to replicate or cause infection. The particulate nature and redundant array of native antigen on the surface of the VLP incites a greater recognition by the immune system. We have successfully produced native RSV-VLPs that display surface spikes and resemble wild type virus. Our RSV based VLP candidate vaccines are created by co-expressing the proteins M, F and SH or M, F or M, F and G as well as additional combinations. The type and magnitude of the immune response they induce as well as the efficacy afforded by the RSV-VLP candidate vaccines will be assessed in animal models. To fulfill these goals, we have designed three specific aims: Specific aim I: Produce and characterize virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying respiratory syncytial virus surface antigens.in alternative compositions F, F+SH, F+G and F+SH+G Specific aim II: Evaluate the immunogenicity (quality and magnitude of the immune response) elicited by the RSV-VLP vaccine and establish safety profile as well as the protective efficacy afforded by alternative compositions of RSV-VLP vaccines in a mouse model of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Selected candidates will be reevaluated by escalating doses of vaccine in mice. Also, initiate development of stable cell lines for the continuous production of the preferred VLP vaccine. Specific aim III: The VLP composition demonstrating efficacy, potency and safety will be retested in the cotton rat model of respiratory syncytial virus infection seeking probe of efficacy in two model of RSV infection. These studies will support a SBIR Phase II proposal and pursue an IND application with the FDA.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, 15% of all cancer cases and nearly 25% of cancer cases in developing countries are attributable to viruses. Human cancers associated with virus infection include human papillomavirus, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus (KSHV). Of these, KSHV is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected individuals. Infection of KSHV is estimated to account for 34,000 new cancer cases globally. Efforts to develop a KSHV vaccine are limited, due to lack of animal model to test the potential vaccine candidates. Through collaborations, we now have access to common marmosets, a non-human primate model that support KSHV infection and develop skin lesions typical in infected individuals. We have also developed a virus-like particle platform to display KSHV envelope glycoprotein antigens as candidate vaccines that has potential to prevent or treat KSHV infection and its associated malignancies.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on development of an effective vaccine for filovirus infection, which is an etiologic agent of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever and can be transmitted via person-to-person contact, thus posing a high threat of an epidemic outbreak. We have studied the development of VLP vaccines against virus infection, and have shown that EBOV VLPs produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system, which gives high VLP production yield, exhibit DC-stimulating activity and induce strong antibody responses that neutralize EBOV GP mediated virus infection, indicating that such VLPs could be safe and effective vaccines to induce protective immunity against EBOV infection. We also found that immunization with a mixture of DNA and VLP vaccines (DNA/VLP) induced higher levels of both antibody and cellular immune responses in comparison to immunization with either alone. We hypothesize that the novel DNA/VLP vaccine will elicit strong cellular and antibody responses against filovirus infection and that the employment of a new vaccine delivery technology will further augment induction of such responses, with the aim to obtain a vaccine strategy that can confer rapid and long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 1. To improve the immunogenicity of DNA and VLP vaccines for eliciting more potent and durable protective immunity against pan-filovirus infection. We will explore different strategies to modify filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines to enhance their immunogenicity for inducing both antibody and T cell responses as well as their production yield and will determine the immune responses that contribute to and are critical for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the microneedle (MN) technology for filovirus vaccine delivery. We will develop the technology to encapsulate filovirus DNA and VLP vaccines into bio-absorbable MNs and investigate the biological property, stability, and immunogenicity of encapsulated vaccines and investigate different geometrical designs and chemical formulations to further improve the MN vaccine delivery technology for achieving more efficient and reproducible vaccine encapsulation, and improved vaccine stability. Specific Aim 3. To compare the protective efficacy of different vaccine approaches and determine the immune correlates for protection against filovirus infection. We will compare immune responses induced by different vaccine formulations using both conventional intramuscular injection as well as the novel MN vaccine delivery technology and evaluate their protective efficacy against lethal filovirus challenge in small laboratory animal models as well as non-human primates and will determine the correlates of immune responses that are important for achieving long lasting protection against filovirus infection. The results will set the foundation for selection of the most effective candidate vaccine strategy for GMP production and human trials. The successful development of this vaccine strategy may also be readily applied to vaccines against other viral hemorrhagic fevers which still lack effective vaccines.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent virus infections cause disease in hundreds of millions of people and exert constant strain on the global economy due to healthcare costs. While progress has been made towards understanding mechanisms that allow viruses to persist, therapies to control persistent viruses are not optimal due an incomplete understanding of the factors involved in virus persistence. One common theme that accompanies virus persistence is an exhaustive or hypo-responsive state of adaptive immune response. This phenomenon was first described using the staple animal model for studying virus persistence, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), in its natural mouse host and extended to human persistent infections. Using this model, it was revealed that a balance between positive and negative immune regulatory molecules is essential to purge virus infection. One of the most extensively studied mechanisms contributing to virus persistence has been T cell exhaustion, which is potentiated by negative immune regulatory molecules such as IL-10 and PD-1. Interestingly, the absence of two positive immune regulatory molecules, IL-6 and IL-21, result in the inability to control persistent virus infection. These molecules are known to be important for B cell function. However, studies on whether B cells also control persistent virus infection have been neglected and their role remains unknown. A newly discovered member of the IL-6 family, IL-27, modulates both B and T cell responses during infection. However, few studies have examined how IL-27 affects antiviral immune responses. I began studying how IL-27 deletion affects the outcome of both acute and persistent LCMV infection. I made the observation that IL-27-deficiency resulted in prolonged LCMV clone-13 persistence. Prolonged virus persistence in IL-27-/- mice correlated with defects in both T and B cell responses. Virus specific T cells in IL-27-/- mice displayed exacerbated T cell exhaustion following clone-13 infection. Moreover, I discovered that IL- 27-/- mice made elevated levels of IgG1 with minimal production of IgG2a, compared to predominant production of IgG2a in IL-27+/+ hosts. I further demonstrated that development of plasma B cells (the major antibody producers) and anti-LCMV IgG production is required to control clone-13 infection, indicating that antibody likely plays an important role in controlling persistent virus infection. This grant proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which IL-27-deficiency leads to prolonged LCMV persistence. The aims are focused on understanding how IL-27 contributes to altered antiviral T and B cell responses and whether IL-27 signaling on T or B cells is essential to purge persistent LCMV infection. The absence of IgG2a production during persistent virus infection in IL-27-deficient mice suggests that IL-27- dependent induction of IgG2a may be essential to control persistent virus infection. The possibility that a specific antibody isotype may be essential to purge persistent virus infection i novel and will be investigated within this proposal.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dendritic cells are critical for regulating T cell immune responses during virus infection. DCs provide the three necessary signals for optimal T cell activation, which include antigen presentation (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2), and inflammatory cytokines (signal 3). In turn, this leads to rapid T cell proliferation, clonal expansion, differentiation into effector cells, and formation of memory T cells, that combined, are critical for effective pathogen clearance and protection against re-infection. Type I interfero, regulated by the innate immune sensors of viral infection, play a key role in activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during virus infection. However, it is not clear how innate immune sensing regulates protective T cell immune responses during virus infection. We study West Nile virus (WNV) infection, a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus of significant public health concern throughout the world, to dissect the viral and host factors that govern immunity to infection. Following WNV infection of DCs, the RLRs induce a robust type I interferon- mediated antiviral innate immune response that is critical for controlling virus replication. We recently discovered that the RLR LGP2, which lacks the critical caspase-activation and recruitment domains required for innate immune signaling, was found to function in a T cell-intrinsic manner to promote CD8+ T cell survival and effector functions. The absence of LGP2 in CD8+ T cells led to enhanced cell surface expression of death receptors, activation of extrinsic apoptosis signaling, and reduced cytokine secretion. Surprisingly, the protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), which is the essential adaptor to RLR signaling and a known binding partner of LGP2, was not required for promoting T cell survival. These findings demonstrate that LGP2 functions in a MAVS-independent manner to promote T cell immunity. Our studies have defined a key role for the RLRs at the interface between innate (DCs) and adaptive (T cells) immunity during virus infection. However, the mechanism underlying RLR regulation of T cell immunity is not well understood. In this proposal, we will evaluate two specific hypotheses: (1) The RLRs' function within DCs to regulate activation, function, and T cell priming during WNV infection; and (2) LGP2 functions within CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to regulate protective effector and memory immune responses during WNV infection. These proposed studies will likely reveal a broader role for the RLRs as well as uncover new pathways by which host RNA helicases regulate immunity during virus infection. This proposal likely will reveal new therapeutic targets and strategies for vaccine protection against flavivirus infection.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of a vaccine against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major public health priority. Of particular urgency is the need to protect newborn infants from the devastating consequences of congenital HCMV infection, including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and deafness. Recently, a subunit vaccine based on recombinant HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) showed efficacy in a clinical trial. However, it is not clear that a vaccine based on a single HCMV protein will provide robust, long-term protection, particularly for women in their childbearing years. A potential significant advantage of the live, attenuated approach to HCMV vaccines is that such vaccines could elicit an immune response that mimics natural immunity and hence provide broader protection to a wide variety of virus-encoded targets of the host immune response. However, such vaccines carry the theoretical risk of establishing latency, reactivating under conditions of immune suppression, or causing chronic HCMV-associated diseases. An approach to generate an immunogenic, yet safe live vaccine is the deletion of viral genes that subvert host defense mechanisms to infection. Using the guinea pig model of congenital CMV infection, we propose to test this approach by targeting viral genes that subvert two key host defenses: MHC I homolog genes (NK cell evasins) and protein kinase R (PKR) evasins. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated efficacy and safety of a recombinant GPCMV vaccine which had a genomic deletion of a block of MHC I homologs. We propose to identify the key viral gene involved in this attenuation and to test our hypothesis that this gene product evades host defenses by inhibition of the NK cell response (aim 1). We hypothesize this virus will demonstrate superiority immunogenicity over wild-type virus, as assessed by cytokine response, CD8+ response, and antibody titer. A recombinant virus deleted of the MHC I function, ?(MHC, will be evaluated for attenuation in animals, and immune mechanisms will be confirmed by immune assays and NK depletion studies. In the previous funding period we have also identified a GPCMV gene involved in the inactivation of PKR. We propose to characterize this and other PKR evasins (aim 2) toward the goal of generating a deletion virus incapable of inhibiting the PKR response ((PKR). We will combine PKR and MHC mutations in a single attenuated virus construct that we predict will yield a safe, highly attenuated vaccine with improved immunogenicity. Despite tight innate immune control, this (MHC/(PKR construct is hypothesized to elicit strong, long-lasting protective immunity. This concept will be further tested in the GPCMV congenital infection model by evaluating and comparing the (MHC and (MHC/(PKR vaccines (aim 3). We hypothesize these vaccines will demonstrate equal or superior protection to infection with wild-type (control) virus against congenital infection and disease. By identifying optimal attenuated vaccine strategies in the GPCMV model, the translational prospect of genetically designing a vaccine for HCMV that has strong immunogenicity and improved safety will emerge.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is 3% and constitutes a major public health burden. The true incidence of acute hepatitis C is unknown, although injecting drug users (IDUs) remain the population at greatest risk in the developed world. Currently, there is no effective HCV vaccine and only 15- 45% will spontaneously clear infection. Treatment in the acute stages of infection has been shown to be highly effective in non-IDU populations; however, few large studies have specifically addressed the question of the optimal treatment regimen in IDUs, many of whom are identified through asymptomatic seroconversion rather than symptomatic acute hepatitis. In the Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC) we demonstrated that subjects with recently acquired HCV infection (predominantly IDUs) can be successfully recruited, engaged and followed longitudinally. Overall, 167 individuals were enrolled and followed for up to 36 months. 76% of treatment eligible individuals (111/146) chose to commence treatment, including 37 individuals with HIV co- infection. Treatment success (defined as a sustained virological response, SVR) occurred in 55% of HCV monoinfected individuals, despite a high proportion of IDU (80%). SVR rates in the HIV/HCV group who were treated with combination therapy (peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin) were higher at 74%. Both superinfection and reinfection with HCV were observed with possible impact on treatment response rates. Although demonstrating encouraging results, evaluation of strategies to further enhance treatment response rates are obviously required, particularly among IDUs with recently acquired infection. We propose to 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of peginterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin combination therapy versus PEG-IFN monotherapy among individuals with recent HCV infection 2) define the incidence, risk factors and natural history of HCV superinfection during treatment and its impact on virological response and 3) determine the prevalence and complexity of HCV protease and polymerase inhibitor mutations in recently acquired infection. The study will be identified as ATAHC II and will involve a randomized clinical trial design to evaluate the efficacy of combination versus monotherapy for 24 weeks. The same definition for newly acquired HCV infection will be used as in ATAHC to include individuals with an estimated duration of HCV infection up to 18 months. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals will be included. The primary endpoint of the study will be SVR. Secondary virological and safety secondary endpoints will be evaluated as will the impact of treatment on injection drug use, social stability and mental health. The prevalence of mixed infection at baseline and the incidence of superinfection in those without HCV suppression in the first 12 weeks of therapy will be assessed using both standard bulk sequencing and novel methods designed to detect the presence of low level HCV quasispecies. All individuals will be assessed for the presence of protease and polymerase resistance at screening using a panel of well characterised nucleic acid mutations in the NS3 / 4a and NS5 gene regions.',\n",

       " \"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually.  Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses continue to circulate enzootically in poultry in many countries and continue to cause human infections. Recently a novel avian H7N9 strain emerged in China also causing human infections and fatalities. A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to model host adaptation, map viral virulence factors and host factors in disease progression, evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines were performed.Understanding the origin, virulence, and pathogenic properties of the 1918 virus, is crucial for current public health preparedness and future pandemic planning. The origin of the 1918 pandemic virus has not been resolved, but its coding sequences are very like those of avian influenza virus.  Recent work with 1918:low pathogenicity avian influenza H1N1 chimeric viruses suggested that the virulence factor(s) in the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) gene might be shared with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses expressing H1 HAs.  Work is ongoing to assess experimental mouse pathogenicity with low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses with all 16 subtypes.  These viruses are also serving as challenge strains in experiments designed to evaluate influenza viral-like particle (VLP) vaccines.Studies in several experimental animal models showed that 1918 influenza virus infection resulted in severe lung pathology associated with dysregulated immune and cell death responses. To determine if reactive oxygen species produced by host inflammatory responses play a central role in promoting severity of lung pathology, we treated 1918 influenza virus-infected mice with the catalytic catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic, salen-manganese complex EUK-207 beginning 3 days postinfection. Postexposure treatment of mice infected with a lethal dose of the 1918 influenza virus with EUK-207 resulted in significantly increased survival and reduced lung pathology without a reduction in viral titers. In vitro studies also showed that EUK-207 treatment did not affect 1918 influenza viral replication. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a reduction in the detection of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 and the oxidative stress marker 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in lungs of EUK-207-treated animals compared to vehicle controls. High-throughput sequencing and RNA expression microarray analysis revealed that treatment resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory response genes and increased lung metabolic and repair responses. These results directly demonstrate that 1918 influenza virus infection leads to an immunopathogenic immune response with excessive inflammatory and cell death responses that can be limited by treatment with the catalytic antioxidant EUK-207. Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia is often associated with influenza or an influenza-like syndrome. Morbidity and mortality due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or influenza and pneumonia, which includes bacterial co-infection, are among the top causes of death by infectious diseases in the United States. We developed a non-lethal influenza A virus (IAV) (H3N2)/S. aureus co-infection model in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to test the hypothesis that seasonal IAV infection predisposes non-human primates to severe S. aureus pneumonia. Infection and disease progression were monitored by clinical assessment of animal health; analysis of blood chemistry, nasal swabs, and X-rays; and gross pathology and histopathology of lungs from infected animals. Seasonal IAV infection in healthy cynomolgus macaques caused mild pneumonia, but unexpectedly, did not predispose these animals to subsequent severe infection with the community-associated MRSA clone USA300. We conclude that in our co-infection model, seasonal IAV infection alone is not sufficient to promote severe S. aureus pneumonia in otherwise healthy non-human primates. The implication of these findings is that comorbidity factors in addition to IAV infection are required to predispose individuals to secondary S. aureus pneumonia.\",\n",
       " 'Vaccinia virus is used to vaccinate persons to prevent disease due to smallpox. Compared with other live virus vaccines, the smallpox vaccine is associated with frequent side effects including fever, a sore or swollen arm, headache, and fatigue. Other more serious side effects have also been reported including development of multiple lesions outside the vaccination site (generalized vaccinia), inflammation of the brain (postvaccinia encephalitis), severe infection of the skin in persons with a history of eczema (eczema vaccinatum), and disseminated vaccinia virus infection in immunocompromised persons (progressive vaccinia). Previously, we tested blood from smallpox vaccine recipients who received the Dryvax formulation of vaccine and found that 4 of 202 blood samples (from 3 of 27 vaccine recipients) were positive for the smallpox vaccine virus in the blood by PCR, but none were positive by culture. The lack of finding infectious smallpox vaccine virus in the blood indicates that the current guidelines for deferral of blood donation from smallpox vaccine recipients are appropriate. Since the study was begun, the Dryvax formulation of smallpox vaccine has been replaced by the ACAMBIS 2000 formulation. We are now testing persons who received the ACAMBIS 2000 formulation of vaccinia and will be determining if blood samples and throat swabs might contain virus.Last year, in collaboration with investigators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at Emory University, we reported a patient who developed progressive vaccinia after smallpox vaccination and cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of acute leukemia. The patient was treated with vaccinia immune globulin and two investigational drugs, ST-246 and CMX001 to slow the progression of the vaccinia virus infection and allow time for his cellular immunity to return after chemotherapy. The level of virus on swabs from the skin gradually declined as his T cell function approved, and the level of vaccinia virus-specific T cells in the blood gradually declined as his infection came under control. This case demonstrated the need for careful laboratory monitoring of patients with progressive vaccinia and the need for development of new anti-poxvirus drugs to manage these diseases.',\n",
       " 'LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. In February 2013, a novel avian-origin H7N9 subtype influenza virus emerged in China causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in humans. A total of 135 human cases including 45 deaths occurred in the first wave from February to May 2013 (including 2 cases in July). From October 2013 a second wave of human infection began that caused more than 200 cases. We generated a live attenuated H7N9 influenza vaccine viruses that possesses the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments from the newly emerged wild-type (wt) A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and six internal protein gene segments from the cold-adapted influenza virus A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA ca) by reverse genetics. The H7N9 ca vaccine virus was immunogenic in ferrets.  A single dose of vaccine conferred complete protection of ferrets from homologous wt A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and near complete protection from heterologous wt A/Netherlands/219/2013 (H7N7) challenge infection. Therefore, this H7N9 LAIV candidate has been selected for vaccine manufacture and clinical evaluation to protect humans from wt H7N9 virus infection. H2 influenza viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968 and therefore a significant portion of the population would be susceptible to infection should H2 influenza viruses re-emerge. H2 influenza viruses continue to circulate in avian reservoirs worldwide and these reservoirs are a potential source from which these viruses could emerge. Three reassortant cold-adapted (ca) H2 pandemic influenza vaccine candidates with HA and NA genes derived from the wild-type A/Japan/305/1957 (H2N2) (Jap/57), A/mallard/6750/1978 (H2N2) (mal/78), or A/swine/MO/4296424/2006  (H2N3) (sw/06) viruses and the internal protein gene segments from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca virus were generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics (Jap/57 ca, mal/78 ca and sw/06 ca, respectively). The vaccine candidates exhibited the in vitro phenotypes of temperature sensitivity and cold adaptation and were restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of ferrets. In mice and ferrets, the vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against homologous wild-type virus challenge. Of the three candidates, the sw/06 ca vaccine elicited cross-reactive antibodies and provided significant protection against the greatest number of heterologous viruses. These observations suggest that the sw/06 ca vaccine should be further evaluated in a clinical trial as a H2 pandemic influenza vaccine candidate. Live attenuated cold adapted (ca) H5N1, H7N3, H6N1 and H9N2 influenza vaccine viruses that were developed by LID and MedImmune replicated in the respiratory tract of mice and ferrets and 2 doses of vaccines were immunogenic and protected these animals from challenge infection with homologous and heterologous wild type (wt) viruses of the corresponding subtypes. However, when these vaccine candidates were evaluated in Phase I clinical trials, there were inconsistencies between the observations in animal models and humans. The vaccine viruses did not replicate well and immune responses were variable in humans, even though the study subjects were seronegative to the vaccine viruses before vaccination.  Therefore, we sought a model that would better reflect the findings in humans and evaluated African green monkeys (AGMs) as a non-human primate model.  The distribution of sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract of AGMs was similar to humans.  We evaluated the replication of wt and ca viruses of avian influenza (AI) subtypes, H5N1, H6N1, H7N3, and H9N2 in the respiratory tract of AGMs. All of the wt viruses replicated efficiently while replication of the ca vaccine viruses was restricted to the upper respiratory tract. We also evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of H5N1, H6N1, H7N3 and H9N2 ca vaccines. Protection from wt virus challenge correlated well with the level of serum neutralizing antibodies. Immune responses were slightly better when vaccine was delivered by both intranasal and intratracheal delivery than intranasally by sprayer. We conclude that live attenuated pandemic influenza virus vaccines replicate similarly in AGMs and human subjects, and that AGMs may be useful model to evaluate the replication of ca vaccine candidates.The influenza virus PB2 protein is a major determinant of the virus host-range. Lysine (K) at amino acid (aa) 627 of PB2 (PB2-627) is generally seen in viruses isolated from mammals while glutamic acid (E) is found in viruses from avian hosts. A pair of wild-type (wt) human H5N1 isolates, A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203) with PB2-627K and A/Vietnam/1204/04 (VN1204) with PB2 627E isolated from pharyngeal swab and tracheal aspirate, respectively from the same patient differed by a K and E disparity at PB2-627. Direct sequencing of viral RNA from clinical material showed a mixed population, suggesting that the latter were independently selected during replication in the human respiratory tract, and are markers of mammalian adaptation. When and where the adaptive mutations in the PB2 protein occur remained unclear. The goal of our study was to determine when in the course of infection in a mammal and in which part of the respiratory tract the change at PB2-627 in a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus would occur. Using deep sequencing, we defined the viral population from the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice over the course of 7 days following intranasal administration of each virus. We found that a glutamic acid to lysine adaptive mutation at PB2-627 appeared synchronously in the upper and lower respiratory tract of infected mice and the transition was complete on day 6 post-infection. The adaptive mutation correlated well with efficient replication of the virus. Our data provides direct evidence of the importance of the PB2-627K mutation in the adaptation of avian viruses to mammals and identifies a critical window that should be targeted for antiviral treatment. Although lymphopenia is a hallmark of severe infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 and the newly emerged H7N9 influenza viruses in humans, the mechanism(s) by which lethal H5N1 viruses cause lymphopenia in mammalian hosts remains poorly understood. Because influenza-specific T cell responses are initiated in the lung draining lymph nodes, and lymphocytes subsequently traffic to the lungs or peripheral circulation, we compared the immune responses in the lung draining lymph nodes following infection with a lethal A/HK/483/97 or non-lethal A/HK/486/97 (H5N1) virus in a mouse model. We found that lethal H5N1, but not non-lethal H5N1 virus infection in mice enhances Fas ligand (FasL) expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), resulting in apoptosis of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells via a Fas-FasL mediated pathway. We also found that pDCs, but not other DC subsets, preferentially accumulate in the lung draining lymph nodes of lethal H5N1 virus-infected mice and that the induction of FasL expression on pDCs correlates with high levels of IL-12p40 monomer/homodimer in the lung draining lymph nodes. Our data suggest that one of the mechanisms of lymphopenia associated with lethal H5N1 virus infection involves a deleterious role for pDCs in which elimination of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells by pDC-induced apoptosis contributes to lymphopenia in lethal HPAI H5N1 infection.',\n",
       " \"Foremost among the pathogens under study in this new project is the influenza virus, including the agents of conventional seasonal influenza, novel new strains of influenza A such as the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain that emerged in April 2009, as well as the ongoing threat of avian subtypes such as the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Novel means first to better characterize and then to treat infection with these respiratory pathogens using existing or newly developed strategies are a primary focus of this important new project within the Clinical Research Section of the LIR. The first major initiative undertaken in this project was a collaborative protocol undertaken with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) as well as the Department of Defense to determine if novel pharmacokinetic means could be used to extend the useful half-life of oseltamivir, the major licensed oral antiviral drug used to treat seasonal influenza in the United states and elsewhere and also a drug in comparatively short supply on a global scale.The pharmacokinetics proved that probenecid could be useful in extending the supply of oseltamivir in a situation of limited drug supply.The ability of oseltamivir to treat effectively severe cases of seasonal influenza may be limited, and knowledge of its utility in treating human cases of avian influenza is largely anecdotal. For these reasons NIAID launched a portfolio of clinical trials focused on the therapeutics of human influenza. One is a phase II double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted within a network of research collaborators in Southeast Asia that compared the relative efficacy of high dose versus standard-dose oseltamivir for the treatment of severe influenza and avian influenza. This trial was completed in the affected countries and showed no survival benefit to double-dose treatment. An additional trial was a phase II vaccine dose-finding pilot study for the development of an anti-influenza A (H5N1) intravenous hyper-immune globulin preparation of potential utility in the treatment of human cases of avian influenza. We conducted a dose-escalating, unblinded clinical trial involving 75 subjects aged 18-59 years. No statistically significant dose-related increases in the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody were observed when the 90-microg, 120-microg, and 180-microg cohorts were compared. However, the results did suggest that a third and fourth dose of the H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine may result in higher hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization GMTs, compared with the GMTs resulting from fewer doses, even if there was no apparent benefit to increasing the dose of the vaccine. In addition to these trials, we also undertook a study of a novel agent with potential antiviral activity against a variety of respiratory viruses, including influenza. In this phase I double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical Poly-ICLC (synthetic dsRNA strands of poly-inosinic and poly-cytidylic acids), normal volunteers received escalating doses of this biologic response modifier through nasal administration. Although there were no consistent local or systemic immunologic effects that emerged, the product was both safe and well tolerated topically. Beginning with the emergence of the pandemic strain of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza in April 2009, our section also undertook additional clinical research efforts to help better characterize and treat infection with both novel and seasonal subtypes of influenza.  A protocol was developed to allow serial collection of high-titer anti-influenza plasma either from patients recovering from naturally-acquired infection or from recipients of the trivalent vaccine. The purpose is to allow harvesting of a pool of high-titer antisera (in the form of either plasma or a manufactured IVIG product) that could then be tested as a potential therapeutic adjunct in the management of patients with severe or life-threatening influenza infection. A treatment trial involving open-label administration of two units of hyperimmune plasma to hospitalized patients with severe influenza was launched domestically with the goal of enrolling and studying 100 patients on a multicenter basis. Most recently we have also designed an international multi-center randomized, double-blind study of hyperimmune IVIG plus standard-of-care versus standard-of-care alone in hospitalized patients with severe influenza. This clinical outcome trial was preceded by completion of a multi-center pilot trial in 31 patients through the INSIGHT network addressing the safety, pharmacokinetics, and logistics of administering hyperimmune IVIG to patents with acute influenza. We have also been conducting two randomized multicenter trials internationally evaluating 1) the virologic and clinical correlation of triple combination anti-influenza treatment versus monotherapy in at-risk populations, and 2) the use of virologic assessments in measuring the effects of oseltamivir versus placebo in mild outpatient disease. More recently we have also initiated a safety and pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers of single and then multiple doses of a novel antisense compound, AVI-7100, that has activity against influenza. Recruitment into the single dose phase has been completed and data analyses are ongoing. We continue to provide scientific and logistical support to the Mexico infectious diseases network La Red, a multi-site collaboration with the Mexico Ministry of Health designed to promote sustainability and capacity to continue clinically relevant and high-quality research on emerging infectious diseases. The five sites in Mexico City include two pediatric sites. Finally, we have also continued to contribute to the management and oversight of three large international observational protocols for outpatients or hospitalized patients with seasonal influenza infection administered under the auspices of the INSIGHT clinical trials network. The goal of these trials is to better characterize the clinical aspects of seasonal influenza infection on a global basis, to define predictors of severe disease and/or death including host genomics, to sequence and compare viral genomes on a geographic and epidemiologic basis, and to develop a repository of clinical research specimens potentially of great value in helping map viral antigenic drift, identifying emerging patterns of drug resistance, and characterizing other aspects of the evolving pandemic. Most recently these protocols have been modified to also permit enrollment of patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus infections such as that due to the MERS-CoV agent. Lastly, in addition to the clinical trials described above, we continue to 1) monitor yearly the clinical and psychologic status of a subset of patients previously exposed to anthrax as a result of the October 2001 anthrax attacks, including maintaining an open clinical protocol for the study of additional anthrax exposures that may occur through accidental or occupational exposures, and 2) support a clinical research protocol to allow the hospitalization (within the Clinical Center's Special Clinical Studies Unit) and treatment of BSL-3/4 laboratory workers potentially exposed to select agents, or of other patients exposed to emerging infectious diseases of public health importance. This latter protocol will also permit us to hospitalize and provide care for health care workers potentially exposed to, or infected with, Ebola virus as a result of deployment to regions of West Africa presently suffering from an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus infection. At the Clinical Center we have also initiated plans to undertake one or more phase 1 safety/toxicity studies of investigational vaccines or MCMs with putative activity against Ebola virus.\",\n",
       " 'Objective (A)Arenaviruses: Lassa virus isolates from Mali are less virulent then classical isolates, and in macaques disease progression was atypical with primarily pulmonary disease manifestation. Our results suggest that clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Mali may be atypical, which might explain the low incidence of disease in this region.Bunyaviruses: We have characterized two animal models for the study of Sin nombre virus; an infection model in Syrian hamsters and a disease model in rhesus macaques. Using the novel nonhuman primate model we performed the first temporal characterization of the pathophysiology of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and identified several key factors, including viremia, hematological abnormalities and tissue specific immune dysregulation in the development of this rare but frequently fatal disease.Filoviruses: The Syrian hamster we have developed displays almost all hallmark features of human disease including coagulopathy, and the suitability for antiviral studies seems promising. Using this model, we have investigated the mechanisms in which hamsters are protected from wild-type Ebola virus and determined that a CD4+ T cell response, facilitating a neutralizing antibody response is responsible for natural immunity (unpublished data).Paramyxoviruses: We have performed a histopathological comparison of two strains of Nipah virus in the Syrian hamster model, representing the two proposed genotypes of Nipah virus, Malaysia and Bangladesh. No difference in severity of rhinitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia could be detected on 4 days after inoculation, although these lesions seemed slightly more severe in animals infected with the isolate from Bangladesh on 2 days after inoculation. Moreover, we gained some insight in the tropism of Nipah virus by showing that Nipah virus antigen could only be detected in small and medium size arteries but not veins (unpublished data).Objective (B)Bunyaviruses: Ongoing transfer and depletion studies using our adenovirus-based CCHF vaccines expressing the nucleoprotein or glycoproteins of CCHF virus indicated that antibodies are the mechanism of protection of these vaccine vectors. We have also performed a study to examine the durability of the VSV-based Andes virus vaccine in hamsters. This vaccine afforded significant protection when given 6 months prior to challenge, but lost efficacy after 1 year.Filoviruses: We have investigated the mechanism of protection of the recombinant Vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) based Ebola vaccine in nonhuman primates. Depletion studies demonstrated that neutralizing antibody responses are critical for the efficacy of the vaccine (Marzi 2013). Furthermore, we have evaluated the protective efficacy of live or inactivated rabies-based Ebola vaccines expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein in a nonhuman primate model. Protection was achieved with all vaccination approaches using a prime/boost strategy and largely dependent on the quality of the humoral immune response. All our filovirus vaccine efforts were summarized and discussed in several recent review articles.Paramyxoviruses: We developed rVSV-based Nipah virus vaccines expressing either the nucleoprotein (N), fusion protein (F) or glycoprotein (G) of Nipah virus, strain Malaysia. Efficacy studies were performed in the Syrian hamster model and showed that the F and G protein expressing vaccine vectors provide full protection in this animal model. Current studies support the notion that the humoral immune responses are critical for vaccine efficacy. The vaccine was also tested in the African green monkey model and was efficacious in protecting animals from Nipah virus disease (Prescott in preparation). Furthermore, this vaccine protects hamsters when administered within one day of challenge and be utilized for ring vaccination in outbreak settings. Objective (C)Bunyaviruses: We are currently characterizing the immune response to hantaviruses in their natural hosts. For this we have been using our in-house deer mouse colony, the reservoir for Sin nombre virus (North American hantavirus). In contrast to Sin nombre, which persistently infects deer mice, Andes virus infection is efficiently cleared by deer mice. Deer mice mount an anti-inflammatory response to Sin nombre virus allowing for persistence, but mount a strong inflammatory response to Andes virus. It is thought that hantaviruses cause disease via an immunopathogenic mechanism. For this, we performed T cell depletion in hamsters, a model for human disease. Depletion did not alter the pathogenicity or replication of Andes virus indicating that pro-inflammatory T cell responses do not contribute to disease.Paramyxoviruses: In Bangladesh, outbreaks of Nipah virus occur almost every year, resulting in respiratory and neurological disease with high case-fatality rates. Based on epidemiological data Nipah virus is thought to be transmitted from fruit bats to humans via drinking of date palm sap contaminated by bats. Additionally, human-to-human transmission has been shown to occur. We experimentally modeled the proposed transmission cycle of Nipah virus in Syrian hamsters. Hamsters that drank artificial palm sap containing Nipah virus became infected and developed neurological signs of disease. Virus replication occurred mainly in the respiratory tract. Hamsters infected with Nipah virus through drinking of contaminated palm sap could transmit the virus to uninfected cage mates.Objective (D)Filoviruses: Ribavirin can effectively extend the time-to-euthanasia of hamsters infected with Ebola virus, but as observed in cell culture appears to rapidly develop resistance that is either viral or cellular based. DEB025 has shown activity against Ebola virus in vitro (EC50 5uM) and combination treatment with ribavirin has been assessed; however a synergic antiviral effect was not observed. We have also screened a small collection of broad spectrum antivirals that are in development against influenza and other RNA viruses using a recombinant Ebola that expresses Firefly luciferase generating two potential lead compounds for further assessment.In the past year we have further utilized recombinant Ebola viruses to study virus biology, and identified the modulation of TGF-&#946; signaling by Ebola virus and developed a model for its role in pathogenesis, as well as in analyzing the role of gene borders on transcriptional regulation of Ebola virus gene expression. Furthermore, we have developed novel experimental systems that allow modeling of the complete Ebola virus life cycle over multiple infectious cycles without the need for a high containment laboratory. We will continue this work, and are now in the process of moving this into animal models to study pathogenesis.We have studied the mechanism of Ebola virus RNA editing. Studies have identified primary and secondary structural requirements and a potential role for VP30 as a necessary factor for RNA editing.Objective (E)Arenaviruses: Our continuous ecological studies have further defined endemic areas for a unique Lassa virus, Soromba R, in Mali. In conjunction, we have begun breeding Mastomys natalensis, the natural reservoir of Lassa virus. First infection studies defined the animals as susceptible to Lassa virus.',\n",
       " 'HCV is a major public health problem, infecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Most cases of HCV infection become persistent and may eventually lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is an enveloped virus classified in the Flaviviridae family. The single-strand, positive-sense viral RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor that is processed into three structural proteins (C, E1, E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) by host and viral proteases. The RNA genome of HCV has significant heterogeneity with six major genotypes and numerous subtypes. HCV infection is currently treated with alpha interferon (IFN&#945;)-based therapy. Although the treatment outcome is variable among the six major HCV genotypes, only 50% of treated patients infected with genotype 1 respond to therapy. The ability of HCV to establish persistent infection with great success in human has been attributed, in part, to a variety of strategies to evade host immune and IFN-induced defenses. Epidemiological studies suggest that up to 20% of acutely infected HCV patients can resolve the infection without treatment, which implies that innate and/or adaptive immune responses are indeed capable of controlling the outcome of HCV infection. The molecular mechanisms that regulate innate intracellular antiviral responses may therefore serve as pivotal points of control, potentially limiting host permissiveness for HCV replication and favorably modulating subsequent adaptive immune responses. A major consequence of virus infection is the induction of the type I interferons (IFN) including IFN&#945;/&#946;, which are cytokines of immune system with essential function in innate and adaptive immune response. Secreted IFN then triggers hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) expression which establishes an antiviral state in the surrounding of virus-infected cells to limit viral replication, spread and infection. The in-vivo induction of interferons and interferon stimulated genes is a critical component of the human innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other viral pathogens. As a down-stream effector in the Type I interferon pathway, interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) has been shown to play a pivotal role in this chain of innate immunity. ISG15 is a 15 KDa ubiquitin like protein. Upon IFN&#945; stimulation, ISG15 is induced and conjugated with target proteins, leading to a cascade of ubiquitin-like protein degradation. During infection with Ebola virus, ISG15 was found to suppress Nedd4-mediated ubiquitin E3 activity, which led to the inhibition of Ebola egress. Also, ISG15 dependent ISGylation has been shown to block the release of retrovirus from infected cells. Over-expression of ISG15 in human medulloblastoma cells can up-regulate IRF3-induced interferon response and inhibit the replication of Japanese encephalitis virus. Recent studies suggest that ISG15 participates in the host defense against viral infection through multiple pathways in addition to those involving interferon. The mechanisms of ISG-15 action in HCV infection are not clearly defined and controversial. In the past year, we employed short-term (siRNA) and stable (shRNA) inhibition of ISG15 in adapted human hepatoma cells (Huh 7.5.1) and measured effects on HCV replication and HCV egress into supernatant fluid. After treatment with siRNA ISG15 or shRNA ISg15, the level of ISG15 mRNA was reduced by 50% and 90%, respectively. Importantly, ISG15 silencing had only minor effects on reducing HCV intracellular RNA copy number, but reduced the level of HCV RNA in culture supernatants by 4-fold using siRNA and 8-fold using shRNA. The opposite and expected effect was observed when ISG15 was over-expressed, in which case HCV copy number in culture supernatants increased 3-fold. In examining the mechanism of reduced HCV egress following ISG15 silencing, it was shown that ISG15 knockdown reduced HCV IRES activation and the expression of viral proteins, particularly the core protein. We are still investigating how ISGylation might affect the association of HCV with lipid droplets. HCV is a positive-strand RNA virus. After released into cytoplasm, HCV RNA severs as a template for the viral translation and replication. Therefore, the coupling between the viral translation and viral RNA replication plays an important role in the modulation of HCV replication. In order to escape the host defense surveillance, HCV developed a complex strategy to coordinate these two processes. Of these, host factors have been documented to involve in this modulation. NF-kB, as a critical host transcription factor, has been implicated in the regulation of HCV infection and replication. The NF-kB family is composed of five structural similar proteins: p50, p52, RelA, c-Rel and RelB. In general, upon extracellular stimulation, RelA can rapidly translocate into nucleus through the phosphorylation of IkB and immediately induces the extensive gene expression. In viral infection, NF-kB has been shown to bind Alu repeats residing on chromosomes, leading to long-distance chromosomal interactions and initiating transcription of IFN- during the earlier phrases of viral infection. Therefore, in order to subvert innate immune responses, many viruses manage their distinctive viral proteins to target NF-kB mediated IFN- response. For instance, Influenza virus NS1 protein can suppress virus-induced NF-kB activation and IFN- synthesis. Vaccinia virus can also employ E3 protein to inhibit NF-kB-mediated IFN- induction. Some viruses can hijack cellular NF-kB signaling as their implements to antagonize IFN- and enhance viral transcription such as HIV-1, and EBV. To further clarify the role of NF-kB in the HCV lifecycle, we used shRNA RelA to knockdown the activation of NF-kB. Intriguingly, we found that RelA silencing significantly increased HCV IRES mediated viral translation, which in turn led to a higher level of viral protein expression in HCV infected cells. Furthermore, RelA silencing greatly enhanced HCV viral RNA replication inside the cells and the production of infectious HCV. Our studies showed that these enhancements were dependent on NF-kB mediated interferon beta response.',\n",
       " '1.Orthopoxvirus pathogenesisA goal of EVPS is to understand virus-host interactions and exploit them for countermeasure development. Previously, we had established that infection of rhesus macaques with cowpox virus (CPXV) resulted in a disease that resembled human hemorrhagic smallpox, a rare and nearly 100% lethal disease associated with secondary bacterial infections. We compared the impact of antibiotic treatment on disease progression. 8 NHPs were IV inoculated with CPXV, 4 were treated with antibiotics, 4 were not. We did not observe a difference in onset of clinical signs or outcome between the groups. We did observe some differences in clinical parameters such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel serum chemistry values. As an additional step in development of the IV NHP CPXV model we performed a serial euthanasia study with cardiac MR to evaluate cardiac function through the course of disease.  We observed acute changes in heart function that coincided with subjects reaching moribund endpoint criteria.  We also altered the route of inoculation of CPXV in macaques to determine if small particle aerosol results in disease that more closely resembles human smallpox. We observed an LD100 and LD50 and disease progression was different than IV inoculation and did not result in hemorrhagic signs or secondary bacterial infections. We also performed chest CT to evaluate lung progression for further development of medical imaging techniques for use in infectious disease studies. To further develop our CPXV model as a surrogate for smallpox, large particle aerosol inoculation was performed.  In contrast to the small particle aerosol inoculation experiments, large particle aerosol inoculation resulted in reduced inflammation in the lung as evaluated by CT.  With large particle aerosol inoculation, we were unable to achieve an LD100, even at 100 fold more virus than small particle aerosol. Our studies indicate the route of inoculation influences disease outcome.  Our third project studying orthopox pathogenesis is based on our Backwards Matched Longitudinal Analysis which identified several cytokines that were statistically associated with lethal or non-lethal outcome in NHPs. The duration and intensity of certain cytokines was associated with survival (IFN-gamma and RANTES) or non-survival (MCP-1). The role of these cytokines was investigated using recombinant virus expressing each cytokine and knockout mice of the cytokine or its receptor. MCP-1 expressing virus and MCP-1 and MCP-1 receptor knockout mice had increased pathogenicity when compared to wild type virus. The MCP-1data suggests that macrophages are essential for controlling infection, but excessive MCP-1 alter macrophage function which may exacerbate disease. IFN-gamma expressing virus did not develop disease, and knockout of IFN-gamma or its receptor resulted in increased pathogenicity. Mice inoculated with interferon gamma expressing virus did not develop any signs of disease and survived lethal challenge at the equivalent 100% lethal dose of wild type virus. Expression of interferon gamma at the site of infection via the recombinant virus resulted in protection from challenge with the LD100 of wild type virus.  2. Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and Ebola virusWe have been developing a rabies virus based vaccine that expresses the glycoprotein (GP) from ebolavirus, marburgvirus and sudanvirus.  Previously we developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University. Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced cellular and humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. We evaluated our vaccine candidates in a rhesus macaque challenge model. 100% protection was observed with live attenuated RABV-GP. The inactivated and RVdelG-GP viruses provided 50% protection.  Strong humoral and cellular immunity was observed. In summary, our findings indicated that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, and RVdelG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use. We also further developed our vaccine constructs to use codon optimized filoviruses and have demonstrated immunogenicity and safety of these constructs in mice.3.Filovirus Molecular Virology We are also investigating molecular virology of filoviruses.  We are studying the role of phosphorylation of the viral proteins in the virus lifecycle. We have chosen to focus on VP35 as it is essential for transcription and replication of the genome. Using a replicon system we have generated point mutations and clustered point mutations of potential phosphorylation sites and evaluate the mutant for replication and transcription. Our data indicates a hierarchical phosphorylation strategy that regulates VP35 function. A second project involves identification of structure and function relationships of the EBOV noncoding regions.  We have identified host proteins that interact with these EBOV genome regions.  We are working to identify the proteins. We have identified HSC70 as interacting with at least one domain in the EBOV Trailer by pull-down assays and confirmed using immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR. Three HSC70 binding domains have been identified within the EBOV Trailer and mutational analysis of the 5 most region results in a decrease in replicon signal. We have also undertaken SHAPE analysis of the EBOV Trailer to define the secondary structure of the EBOV Trailer. Based on these data we may identify therapeutic targets as well as establish mechanisms of filovirus lifecycle regulation.4. MERS-CoVWe have also been developing NHP models for MERS-CoV.  We have established that intratracheal inoculation with MERS-CoV Jordan isolate results in limited respiratory tract disease that peaks between days 4 and 5 post inoculation, resolves by day 9 post inoculation and can be quantified by computed tomography.  Inoculation of common marmosets also results in a longer lived respiratory tract disease that peaks between days 3 and 14, but does not completely resolve, and can be monitored and quantified by computed tomography.  Infectious virus could not be recovered from serial samples in either rhesus or common marmosets.  To further develop the MERS-CoV model we are working with Dr. Ralph Baric to construct and evaluate a MERS-CoV that expresses the human sodium-iodide symporter that can be used as a PET reporter.  We expct this recombinant virus to provide enhanced detail on the infectious process of MERS in NHPs and other animal models.  We have also entered a collaboration with SAB and NMRC to develop a polyclonal antibody to MERS-CoV as a human therapuetic',\n",
       " 'This Report involves work collected under protocol 03-M-0108 (NCT00055575).Clinical Studies:The role of cholinergic system in mood disorders has been highlighted recently through our demonstration that blocking cholinergic muscarinic activity with scopolamine produces rapid antidepressant effects. Our early studies identified an antidepressant effect of scopolamine in both MDD and BD patients. Significant (p< 0.001) clinical improvement occurred following a single infusion of scopolamine. Over the course of the clinical trial, 70% of patients experience a full response (50% reduction in symptoms) and over 50% experience remission of symptoms.A replication of our original finding was published in an independent MDD sample of patients. Moreover, we observed that while men and women show significant clinical improvement following scopolamine, women show a larger response than do men (p< 0.01). Recently, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study to identify an alternative route of scopolamine administration. The NIH pharmacy developed a nasal spray formulation, and over the past year we completed the collection of pharmacokinetic data to identify the nasal spray dose that most closely approximates the area-under-the-curve obtained with the i.v. administration. These samples currently are being processed by our collaborator, Irving Wainer, PhD.  Clinical trials utilizing this route of administration potentially will begin within the next year.Cognitive and Imaging Studies: Behavioral and cognitive features of depression are associated primarily with the processing of affective information. A consistently reported finding is a mood congruent processing bias, which is defined as a tendency to show a bias for processing negative as compared to positive or neutral information. The mood congruent processing bias observed in MDD can be characterized within the framework of cholinergic system and stimulus processing mechanisms. The biased processing of negative or sad information is consistent with over-active cholinergic function in depression resulting in the over-representation of negative information. We would hypothesize that competition among stimuli in the environment engages cholinergic system, and the overactive system alters the bias preferentially towards negative stimuli in MDD. We are utilizing functional brain imaging methods to elucidate the role of the cholinergic system in stimulus processing biases. We characterized behaviorally a stimulus processing bias associated with a selective attention task where face and house stimuli are presented simultaneously. Faster reaction time when attending to faces (vs houses) reflects a stimulus process bias towards faces. Scopolamine selectively increased reaction time when attending to face stimuli with no change when attending to houses, reflecting a stimulus specific shift in the processing bias. The brain regions in visual processing areas which show a bias towards faces (larger response to faces than to houses) during placebo, reduce the bias during scopolamine, a result that complements the behavioral finding. In brain regions that show a bias for processing houses during placebo, no change is observed following scopolamine. Acetylcholine also influences working memory (WM) function through stimulus processing mechanisms and particularly is critical to the encoding of information through stimulus processing mechanisms. We evaluated the influence of blocking cholinergic muscarinic activity on neural responses during WM encoding as the attended stimulus feature was modulated in a fMRI study. During the task a picture of a face was shown (encoding) followed by a delay component (maintenance) then another picture of a face (test/retrieval). Healthy participants were instructed to match the test stimulus to either the identity or the emotional expression of the encoded face. Neural activity associated with encoding was estimated for the emotion and identity task conditions. Blocking cholinergic muscarinic receptors preferentially reduced BOLD response during encoding selectively when attending to the emotional stimulus content, with no change when attending to identity. This finding suggests that the more salient stimulus feature (i.e. emotion) is more susceptible to cholinergic modulation. Biomarker of Treatment ResponseClinical Markers of Treatment Response. We evaluated the potential for baseline clinical ratings to predict treatment response to scopolamine using discriminant function analysis to determine if a linear combination of self-report mood-ratings could discriminate treatment responders from non-responders. The discriminant function identified a set of 4 or 5 clinical ratings that, when combined into a linear function, classified 86% of unipolar patients as responders or non-responders (p= 0.002); the discriminant function scores differed significantly between the responders and non-responders (p< 0.001). A validation analysis was able to correctly predict response classification in over 70% of MDD patients. Similarly, the discriminant function classified 88% of BP patients, and the discriminant function scores differed significantly between the responders and non-responders (p< 0.001). The validation analysis in the BP group was able to correctly predict classification in over 85% of the patients.  We also are considering potential clinical or patient variables that might contribute to the identification of patients who will response to scopolamine treatment.  Previously we demonstrated that gender influenced treatment outcome, and we currently are preparing a manuscript that shows that patients with treatment resistant depression show a comparable rapid clinical response to scopolamine as do treatment naive patients, although the treatment naive group continued to improve over additional infusions.  Recent analyses identified a relation between treatment history and antidepressant response to scopolamine, with treatment naive patients responding better than treatment resistant patients.  Functional Imaging Markers of Treatment Response. Previously we identified areas of bilateral middle occipital cortex where baseline levels of cortical activity under specific task conditions correlated with subsequent treatment response to scopolamine in patients with MDD.  Following treatment with scopolamine, changes in neural response in these same brain regions also correlated with the magnitude of response.  Recently we extended our analyses to considered brain networks and found that differences in network connectivity (implicit vs explicit emotion tasks) prior to treatment correlated with the magnitude of treatment response.  We also used a selective attention task and emotion modulation to estimate emotional processing biases in the same cortical regions prior to treatment with scopolamine, and similarly observed correlations between neural response to specific task conditions and subsequent treatment outcome in patients with MDD.  These findings indicate that difference in response patterns based on emotional content of information has the potential to predict subsequent response to treatment with scopolamine.  We also looked at baseline activity in the same brain regions during performance of an emotion evaluation task prior to treatment with ketamine, which is another rapid acting antidepressant agent.  Again, we observed that the same brain regions that predicted treatment outcome to scopolamine also predicted treatment outcome to ketamine, in an independent cohort of patients with MDD and using a different emotion processing task.  Together, these studies point to the potential for neural activity in middle occipital cortex during emotional processing to provide a biomarker of treatment response across rapid antidepressants.',\n",
       " '(1) To develop animal, especially nonhuman primate, models that mimic human disease:Over the past two years we have developed and characterized nonhuman primate disease models for two emerged respiratory viral pathogens; influenza A virus subtype H7N9 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), a strain obtained from a fatal human case. Animals developed a transient, moderate pneumonia with virus replication occurring throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract. Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage and leads for therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication. Disease models for MERS-CoV were developed and characterized in the rhesus macaque and common marmoset. The rhesus macaque mimics mild-moderate MERS in humans but not severe disease. This model has proven useful to assess vaccine efficacy (see below). Infection of the common marmoset led to the development of a progressive severe pneumonia with approximately 20% lethality. Extensive lesions and high viral loads were detected in the lungs and total RNAseq analysis demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways. This model will in future be used for further drug efficacy testing. (2) To identify and characterize determinants of pathogenicity in animal models:Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. This seems also be the case with the latest pandemic H1N1 virus. In order to study a potentiating effect of influenza and bacterial co-infection we performed a co-infection study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 followed by MRSA showed enhanced clinical disease (unpublished data). Similar studies were performed with a seasonal H3N2 virus and MRSA, in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement. In response to the observation of a high prevalence of comorbidities in severe MERS-CoV cases, the effect of immunosuppression on outcome of MERS-CoV infection was tested in the Rhesus macaque model. Rhesus macaques were immunosuppressed through treatment with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone before MERS-CoV inoculation. Immunosuppressed macaques did not develop more severe disease than immunocompetent animals, but they shed more virus, and viral loads in the lungs were significantly higher than in immunocompetent animals. Despite the increased virus replication, and in line with lack of increase in clinical disease, histological examination of the lungs showed a reduced inflammatory response in immunosuppressed macaques as compared to normal animals. These results suggested that the immune response to infection plays an important role in MERS-CoV pathogenesis (unpublished data). 3) To identify potential targets for intervention:For MERS, a first treatment study using a combination of ribavirin and interferon was performed in the rhesus macaque model showing efficacy as demonstrated by reduced clinical disease signs and viral load in lung tissue. This treatment scheme has been considered for human use in the Middle East endemic areas. In collaboration with the Molecular Targets Program at NCI, griffithsin, a novel viral entry inhibitor, was identified as having potent (EC50 5nM) activity against MERS-CoV. The post-exposure efficacy of nebulized griffithsin in the rhesus macaque model showed moderate reduction of viral load but did not significantly reduce disease signs (unpublished data). A pre-treatment study in rhesus macaques is scheduled. Additional antiviral drugs have also been tested in vitro with nitazoxanide showing a selectivity of approximately 10. An efficacy assessment in rhesus macaques is planned pending delivery of pharmacokinetic data in the rhesus macaque. We have also assessed other compounds in vitro including interferon-beta and Alferon (interferon alpha-n3) both of which have higher antiviral effect than interferon alpha2b. In addition, the cyclophilin inhibitors DEB025 and NIM811 were shown to have antiviral effect against MERS-CoV at clinically achievable concentrations. When DEB025 was combined with ribavirin the EC50 was reduced 4-fold suggesting that this combination may be suitable for use in humans.  A highly potent near germ-line monoclonal antibody has also been assessed in the common marmoset model in a post-exposure setting. Treated animals showed little evidence of clinical signs compared to control animals; however, treated animals had surprisingly high viral loads at necropsy. To address this, a follow up pre-treatment study in marmosets is planned. (4) To develop vaccines and test their efficacy in the developed animal models:In order to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses we are currently applying an approach based on two observations: i) highly conserved B cell epitopes are present within two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk region, and antibodies against them affords heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region can increase antibody responses against other normally poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus vector platform for these studies, which is able to induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody) following a single vaccination. For MERS, we have tested a live-attenuated vaccine based on the vesicular stomatitis virus platform expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein. The vaccine reduced clinical disease and viral load and thus showed promising efficacy (unpublished data). We are currently testing a DNA vaccination platform expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein  these studies are ongoing.',\n",
       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flavivirus genus that has a global impact on public heath due to its widespread distribution and the ability to cause severe disease in humans. Each year, an estimated 390 million individuals are infected by DENV, with clinical manifestations ranging from a self-limiting acute febrile illness (dengue fever) to a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF). Four related serotypes of DENV circulate in nature, each capable of causing the full spectrum of DENV-related disease.  Prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrate that sequential infection with two DENV serotypes is associated with a more severe disease course.  The number of DHF cases reported has increased dramatically during the past twenty years, and now exceeds 250,000 cases annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV.Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in protection against flavivirus infection. Antibodies have been mapped to all three structural domains of the E protein (DI-DIII) that exhibit varying degrees of neutralization potency and confer protection by multiple effector mechanisms. Eliciting neutralizing antibody is a major goal of vaccine development. Complicating these efforts is a requirement for vaccines to simultaneously elicit protection against four different viruses that while antigenically related, share only some of the antibody-binding determinants thought to contribute to virus neutralization. Thus, antibodies raised against one serotype of DENV may react with virions of another serotype, but often with reduced affinity and functional potency.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of severe DENV cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE.The development of a protective tetravalent response is complicated by the possibility that all four components of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may not be equally immunogenic in the vaccinee. Interference and uneven levels of infectivity among DENV strains in this context has been reported. Understanding the immunogenicity of each component of a tetravalent vaccine is an important aspect of vaccine development and identifying appropriate correlates of protection, particularly because it is presently unclear how many serotype-specific responses will be required for protection from all four serotypes of DENV. However, dissecting the specific contribution of each element of a tetravalent vaccine is technically challenging due to the presence of antibodies that bind cross-reactive determinants shared by different components of the vaccine. A detailed map of the functionally important type-specific and group-reactive epitopes on the E protein is not presently available. Improved methodology that distinguishes and quantifies the functional contribution of each component of a tetravalent vaccine would allow for improvements in estimates of vaccine immunogenicity, a more precise correlate of protection, and a powerful investigational tool to study vaccine success and failure.To that end, we propose to develop a novel approach to measure the functional contributions of serotype-specific antibodies against the backdrop of a highly cross-reactive tetravalent polyclonal response. A panel of reporter virus particles (RVPs) containing mutations that destroy antibody-binding determinants will be used to identify functionally important epitopes that elicit type-specific or cross-reactive antibodies present in the serum of DENV vaccinees. An iterative screening process will guide selection of RVPs that are either no longer sensitive to neutralization by cross-reactive antibodies or type-specific responses. RVPs with these characteristics provide two complementary and specific methods for detecting type-specific responses in polyclonal sera.  These tools will then be employed to characterize the epitopes that comprise the neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated or naturally infected humans.',\n",
       " 'Summary: This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to active immunity (preventive vaccines) and passive immunity (monoclonal antibodies) directed against HIV that are conducted by the VRC Clinical Trials Program at the NIH Clinical Center. The clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines have included: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route of administration, device for administration and prime-boost regimens. In FY14, we began evaluation of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against HIV. A brief summary of each study to date follows.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results wss published in FY07: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5):p.601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published: J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12):p.1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published: J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12):p.1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published: Vaccine, 2007. 25(20):p.4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) was a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed. A manuscript describing results from VRC 008 study was published: PLoS One, 2013; 8(4):e59340.VRC 009 (05-I-0081) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLoS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p.1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) was a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine.  In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 011 was published: PLoS One, 2014 Mar 12;9(3).VRC 012 (07-I-0167) is a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed. The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in FY10.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up is ongoing. In FY14, a manuscript describing results was accepted for publication in PLoS One. VRC 016 (11-I-0197) is a Phase Ib descriptive study to evaluate the kinetics and pattern of early innate and adaptive immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, alone and after priming with DNA vaccine. This study was developed and initiated in FY11 and all follow-up completed in FY14.  HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) is a multicenter Phase 2b efficacy study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed in collaboration with the Division of AIDS and HVTN and designed to see whether or not the vaccines have efficacy in prevention of HIV or an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who acquire HIV infection during 2 years of follow-up. Study enrollments were completed in FY13.  Study vaccinations were discontinued in April 2013 based on DSMB recommendations when study results showed that prospectively defined efficacy futility criteria had been met.  Long term follow-up is ongoing.  A manuscript describing results from HVTN 505 was published: N Engl J Med. 2013 Nov 28;369(22):2083-92.VRC 602 (14-I-0019) is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of a human monoclonal antibody, administered intravenously or subcutaneously to healthy adults.  The study was initiated in FY14 and is ongoing.',\n",
       " \"The LID is developing live attenuated vaccines against RSV, HPIV3, HMPV, HPIV1, and HPIV2 (in decreasing order of importance). Our emphasis is on RSV, although we have clinical studies in progress for most of these viruses. These vaccines are developed and produced from cloned cDNAs using reverse genetic systems of our making and employ defined attenuating mutations of our making. We develop candidates in pre-clinical studies and prepare vaccine seeds. Vaccine manufacture is performed under contact under our supervision, and clinical evaluation is performed by contract or collaboration under our supervision. Vaccines are evaluated clinically beginning in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), and moving successively to seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age) followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -24 months of age for RSV, 6-59 months of age for the others). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses may be evaluated further in virus-naive young infants 1-3 months of age. Adult studies are open-label, whereas pediatric studies are double-blind placebo-controlled with a 2:1 ratio of vaccine to placebo recipients. For all RSV studies, subjects are followed during the subsequent RSV season (Nov 01  March 31) following the experimental immunization in order to assess the longevity of the antibody response and the rate and severity of natural RSV infection (although these studies are too small to reliably assess protective efficacy), and to confirm the absence of enhanced RSV disease. Since 2006, these clinical development activities have been supported in part by a CRADA with MedImmune.RSV vaccine: RSV has two antigenic subgroups, A and B, that have extensive cross-reactivity and cross-protection. We presently are focusing on RSV-A, the more important of the two. A subgroup A-based RSV vaccine may prove to be sufficiently cross-protective against RSV-B. If not, an RSV-B-based candidate can be developed based on the results with RSV-A.We previously made an RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delM2-2 that is based on deletion of the ORF encoding the M2-2 protein. This mutation provides up-regulation of antigen synthesis that may increase immunogenicity. In addition, deletion of a gene or ORF should be refractory to reversion or compensation, thus providing increased genetic and phenotypic stability. We have been conducting a phase I clinical study (NCT01459198) of a version of this mutant whose seed virus was supplied by MedImmune and is called RSV MEDI delM2-2. This candidate was highly restricted and well tolerated in adults and seropositive children. We have just completed evaluation in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age, and data analysis is still in progress. The vaccine appeared to induce reasonably strong antibody responses. The subjects in this study happened to have an unusually high incidence of adventitious infections by other respiratory viruses during the study period, which confounded evaluation of tolerability. Therefore, we are initiating a second phase 1 study in 51 additional seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT02040831), which is expected to begin in 2014. This study will use a version of the delM2-2 virus that was derived in our laboratory and is called RSV LID delM2-2. Part of this study will be done in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group.We previously developed another RSV candidate called RSV cps2 that contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and which is highly temperature-sensitive. RSV cps2 is presently in a phase I study in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266). This study involves 51 subjects; enrollment is expected to be completed in July, 2014, and the RSV surveillance period will be completed in March, 2015. Part of this study is being done with IMPAACT.We also previously developed another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein-2 (NS2) gene, which encodes a protein that antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus was shown to be suitably attenuated in seropositive children 12-59 months of age, and presently is being evaluated in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01893554). Enrollment is underway (as of July 2014).Thus, we have three promising RSV platforms in or entering phase I studies: delM2-2 (two versions), RSV cps2, and RSV delNS2del1313. These viruses have different properties (such as temperature-sensitivity and differences in antigen expression) and different mechanisms of attenuation (involving effects on RNA synthesis, regulation of RNA synthesis, IFN antagonism, among others). Our goal is to expeditiously identify a suitable live attenuated RSV candidate to bring forward into larger studies.HPIV3 vaccine: We have completed phase I evaluation of an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that previously had been shown by LID and collaborators to exhibit satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children in phase I and II studies. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons. This virus was evaluated in a phase I clinical study in seronegative children 6-36 months of age in which two doses were given at a 6-month interval to investigate the durability of immunity and the feasibility of boosting at this interval (NCT01021397). Part of this study was done as companion protocols through Seattle Children's Hospital and IMPAACT. The results confirmed the equivalence of the cDNA-derived material with the previously-studied biologically-derived material. In addition, the results showed that the second dose induced an immune response in the few individuals who did not have a response to the first dose, and it boosted immunity in those who had a suboptimal response to the first dose. This is an excellent HPIV3 vaccine candidate that can advance to larger studies. It also is available to be combined with an attenuated RSV vaccine to create a bivalent vaccine, and indeed we previously showed that such a combination was compatible with regard to tolerability, replication, and immunogenicity of the two components.  HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that this candidate is highly attenuated. A phase I study in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. These results provide a benchmark between pre-clinical assays and replication in humans. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics. HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus was highly attenuated in adults. Presently, it is being evaluated in a phase I study in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437). HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. Evaluation in adults and seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age showed that it is highly attenuated. The vaccine is presently being evaluated in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410).\",\n",
       " 'Infection by influenza viruses is mediated via binding of the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to terminally attached &#945;2,3 or &#945;2,6-linked sialic acids (SA) on cell surface glycoproteins. Avian influenza viruses predominantly bind to glycan receptors terminating in &#945;2,3-linked SA while human-adapted viruses predominantly bind to glycan receptors terminating in &#945;2,6-linked SA.  Receptor-binding specificity is an important determinant of host-range restriction and transmission of influenza viruses. The distribution of SA in the human respiratory tract and duck intestine are thought to dictate the specificity of viruses infecting these two species. In humans, the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract primarily expresses &#945;2,6 SA, while the lower respiratory tract (lung) contains both &#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 SA. In contrast, avian species primarily express &#945;2,3 SA in the cells lining the gut. Ferrets, a well-established animal model for influenza, have an &#945;2,3 and &#945;2,6 SA distribution similar to humans, while mice predominantly express &#945;2,3 SA and little &#945;2,6 SA. We assessed the role of receptor-binding preference of the viral HA on virulence and tissue tropism of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. The pH1N1 virus is known to predominantly bind to &#945;2,6 SA and replicate well in the upper and lower respiratory tract of mice and ferrets. We generated two mutant viruses by engineering four mutations in the viral HA gene to alter receptor-binding preference. We found that the receptor specificity of the pH1N1 virus did not influence virulence in mice or viral replication in the respiratory tract of mice or ferrets. Additionally, we found that the WT, &#945;2,6, and &#945;2,3 pH1N1 viruses replicated in similar cell types in the lungs of ferrets. There is increasing evidence that receptor specificity of influenza viruses is more complex than the binary model of &#945;2,6 and &#945;2,3 SA binding and our data suggest that influenza viruses use a wide range of SA moieties to infect host cells.Influenza A viruses, containing eight single stranded RNA segments, cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Reassortment of the influenza viral genome in co-infected cells confers an evolutionary advantage for the virus, and can result in viruses with pandemic potential like the 2009 pandemic H1N1 and 2013 H7N9 virus. Replication of the viral genome occurs in the nucleus of the host cell and the progeny viral RNA (vRNA) segments must be transported to the plasma membrane for budding. The dynamics of vRNA assembly into progeny virions remains unknown. We used recent advances in microscopy to explore vRNA assembly and transport during a productive infection. We visualized four distinct vRNA segments within a single cell using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and observed that foci containing more than one vRNA segment were found at the external nuclear periphery, suggesting that vRNA segments are not exported to the cytoplasm individually. Although many cytoplasmic foci contain multiple vRNA segments, not all vRNA species are present in every focus, indicating that assembly of all eight vRNA segments does not occur prior to export from the nucleus. To extend the observations made in fixed cells, we used a virus that encodes GFP fused to the viral polymerase acidic (PA) protein (WSN PA-GFP) to explore the dynamics of vRNA assembly in live cells during a productive infection. Since WSN PA-GFP colocalizes with viral nucleoprotein and influenza vRNA segments, we used it as a surrogate for visualizing vRNA transport in 3D and at high speed by inverted selective-plane illumination microscopy. We observed cytoplasmic PA-GFP foci colocalizing and traveling together en-route to the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that vRNA segments are exported from the nucleus as subcomplexes that undergo additional assembly en-route to the plasma membrane through dynamic fusion events of vRNA-containing cytoplasmic foci. These observations have broad implications for understanding the intracellular requirements behind reassortment of influenza viruses and may lead to the development of new antiviral targets.It has been suggested that the unusual age distribution of severe disease and death during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, compared to seasonal influenza outbreaks, may at least be partly due to original antigenic sin (OAS). Unlike annual seasonal influenza infections where the elderly are at the greatest risk of suffering from severe disease and death, this age group was protected due to pre-existing immunity in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, while severe disease and death predominated in young adults and children. It has also been suggested that the elderly, who were exposed during their childhood to viruses that were antigenically similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus, generated an antibody response against the viruses of childhood that cross-reacted with the 2009 pH1N1 virus. In contrast, younger individuals produced an antibody response against antigenically dissimilar influenza viruses from their childhood that failed to cross-react with the 2009 pH1N1 virus and diminished their response to the 2009 pH1N1 virus, resulting in more severe disease and death in this age group during the pandemic. To better understand the nature of the protection conferred by H1N1 viruses against subsequent exposure to the 2009 pH1N1 virus, we asked whether prior infection with older seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses would induce OAS upon subsequent infection with the 2009 pH1N1 virus. Evidence of OAS was sought using ferret sera. Ferrets were primed with H1N1 viruses of variable antigenic distance from 2009 pH1N1, and were challenged 6 weeks later with A/California/07/2009 wild-type (CA/09 wt) pH1N1 virus or were vaccinated with a monovalent live attenuated pH1N1 vaccine (CA/09 ca) or monovalent inactivated pH1N1 vaccine (CA/09 iav). In ferrets, seasonal H1N1 priming did not diminish the antibody response to infection or vaccination with the 2009 pH1N1 virus, nor did it diminish the T-cell response, indicating the absence of OAS in seasonal H1N1-virus primed ferrets. Our data from ferrets suggest that prior exposure to H1N1 viruses did not impair the immune response against the 2009 pH1N1 virus.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and are the cause of yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile fever syndromes.  In recent years, much of our laboratory effort was focused on the development and preclinical testing of dengue virus vaccine candidates suitable for inclusion in a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.  Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials, and several tetravalent vaccine admixtures have also recently been evaluated in human subjects.  An optimal tetravalent admixture (TV005) has been selected and is now entering Phase II evaluation.  Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of important functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes,  preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, assistance with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data, 4) support of collaborations with investigators interested in basic virology or immunology studies, 5) use of immune cells collected from our clinical studies to investigate the innate immune response to vaccination, and 6) preclinical development of potential second-generation vaccine candidates, such as the flavivirus pentavalent vaccine designed for control of dengue and Japanese encephalitis.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the AsiaPacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually.  The high fatality rate and frequent residual neuro-psychiatric sequelae in survivors make JEV infection a considerable health problem. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation pentavalent vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory has recovered these engineered viruses and has evaluated their pathogenicity in mice.  The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and thus provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations.  The rJEV/DEN4 chimeric viruses appear to be over-attenuated in mice, indicating that chimerization is much more attenuating for JEV compared to the related West Nile virus.  Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes.  Following evaluation in mice, a number of these recombinant viruses look suitable for consideration as vaccine candidates.',\n",
       " 'The Vector borne viruses from different virus families account for many medically significant viral pathogens. More specifically, the vector borne flaviviruses, which belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, comprise some of the most important emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are generally transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. The mosquito borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Our current research is focused on the TBFV, but studying the biology of TBFV will elucidate the biology of other vector borne viruses. The research in our laboratory employs virology, immunology, advanced imaging techniques, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology, and vector biology. We study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. Studies have also been initiated on the more virulent autochthonous BSL-3 POWV/DTV. Comparison of TBFV biology in mammalian and tick cells. A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. We published a study comparing LGTV virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum. Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems. In contrast to mammalian cells, TBFV-infection in tick cells shows delayed and decreased membrane proliferation. Additionally, electron tomography of infected tick cells shows a shift from spherical vesicles to tubular profiles, especially in the context of persistently infected cells. In 2014, we expanded these structural studies to cultures of primary embryonic brain. LGTV infection was largely restricted to cells of neuronal origin, and ultrastructural studies revealed results similar to those observed in mammalian cell lines, although the frequency of the tubular profiles appeared greater than in permanent cell lines. Cellular structures associated with viral replication and virions were observed all along the processes of neurons, suggesting that these components are transported  to actual nerve endings. Also in 2014, we have developed molecular clones expressing the nonstructural proteins, either singly or in clusters, that should prove suitable for evaluating the role of specific elements in the rearrangement of the cellular membranes. The vectors backbones should allow for good expression in both mammalian and tick cell lines. Molecular biology and molecular pathogenesis of acute and persistent TBFV infection. Persistent infection plays a crucial role in natural life cycle of TBFV in rodent and arthropod hosts, and may also be responsible for prolonged debilitating sequelae observed in survivors of acute TBFV infection. However, this aspect of TBFV biology has been little studied. We successfully established a model of persistent infection of 293T cells with LGTV derived from a full-length molecular clone. Infection resulted in an acute cytopathic phase, in which >90% cell death was observed by day 5. However, if the cultures are re-fed and carefully maintained, the sparse cells surviving the lytic crisis repopulate the culture. These 293T cell cultures can be serially passaged for longer than 30 weeks. Throughout this time, greater than 90% of the cells are positive for LGTV E protein and the cultures produce infectious virus. Although the persistently infected 293T cell cultures produced virus throughout the period, the titer declined with continued passage from near 108 ffu/ml, to approximately 104 ffu/ml. Interestingly, the copy numbers of (+) and (-) viral RNA strands did not change, suggesting a dramatically increasing particle:PFU ratio, consistent with the presence of defective interfering (DI) particles. We examined this hypothesis using specifically designed primers, and found evidence of internal deletions in the structural protein portion of the genome. We are intensively investigating these findings using a deep sequencing strategy specifically designed to capture and characterize viral genomes. Thus, we have successfully established a model of persistent LGTV infection that will prove useful for studying virus biology as well as both the virus and the cell transcriptome. DI particles have been previously identified in persistent flavivirus infections, but an essential role in either initiation or maintenance of persistence is not established.We have also studied changes in the cellular transcriptome, during acute infection as well as the initiation and maintenance of persistent LGTV infection in 293T cells. As noted, LGTV infection of 293T or other mammalian cells leads to an acute cytopathic lytic crisis in which most cells die. The primary mechanism of cell death is thought to be apoptosis. The remaining cells are somehow able to maintain persistent virus replication while either evading or down-modulating the relevant cell death response. Although it seems probable that the apoptosis pathway may be involved, our agnostic approach is to examine the entire cellular response by employing deep sequencing and network analysis of the cellular transcriptome. This unbiased approach enables us to identify the various pathways involved in both acute and persistent LGTV virus infection. We anticipate the implication of novel pathways not previously associated with viral infection.When the cellular transcriptome of 293T cells infected for 48 hours with LGTV (acute) was compared to that from mock infected cells, the expression level of 800 genes was perturbed. However, a similar comparison between persistently infected and mock infected cells indicated that expression levels of 3000 genes were affected .The initial pathway analysis has so far suggested that certain genes, such as IFN-&#946;, may be switched off in the persistent phase, a possible mechanism modulating the antiviral state observed in the acute phase.Evaluation of the results revealed that a set of genes was uniquely perturbed in the persistent phase, but not in the acute phase. This data has enabled us to identify the top 10 pathways specifically associated with viral persistence. Specifically, transcriptome analyses allowed the enrollment of 150 genes into several pathways. Analysis to date implicates pathways important for cell survival, including apoptosis, cell cycle, and immune responses, but also metabolic processes and transcription regulation. More detailed definition of the pathways and elucidation of the roles of specific genes are ongoing.We are presently extending the viral and cellular transcriptome studies of persistent infection to the more virulent BSL3 Powassan/Deer tick virus.',\n",
       " \"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the world, causing serious complications on women's reproductive health including ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics, and pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infections in different population settings, including populations in resource constrained countries.  We have used the Internet, www.iwantthekit.org, since 2004 to offer sampling in Maryland and other areas in the U.S. for chlamydia screening in 6,000 women and over 3500 men using self-obtained vaginal swabs or self-obtained penile-meatal swabs. Additionally the site allows for self-collected rectal samples to be tested. Prevalence for chlamydia for women this year has been 7.3% overall for women, and 16.1% in young women age 15-19 yr. Both young age and Black race were statistically associated with chlamydia positivity. For men, the overall chlamydia prevalence has been 8.45%. Acceptance for self-collecting penile and rectal swabs has been very high. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis infection is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. The WHO has recommended that three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics be offered to control the disease in districts where the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is >10% in children aged 1-9 years, with treatment coverage of at least 80%. We have participated in both surgical and antibiotic treatment intervention studies in Gambia, Niger, and Tanzania in efforts to control trachoma. To evaluate a point of care molecular diagnostic for field use we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and field utility of the Cepheid GeneXpert C. trachomatis assay for ocular chlamydia infection compared to Roche Amplicor assay. In a trachoma-endemic community in Kongwa, Tanzania, 144 children ages 0 to 9 were surveyed to assess clinical trachoma and had two ocular swabs taken. Of the 144 swabs taken the prevalence of follicular trachoma by clinical exam was 43.7%, and by evidence of infection according to Amplicor was 28.5%. The sensitivity of GeneXpert for C. trachomatis when compared to Amplicor was 100% and the GeneXpert test identified more positives in individuals with clinical trachoma than Amplicor. The GeneXpert test for C. trachomatis performed with high sensitivity and specificity and demonstrated excellent promise as a field test for trachoma control. Poling samples before testing has been demonstrated to be a cost effective method when prevalence in low. Positive pools can then be tested individually to determine the individual positive.  When pools are negative all the samples in the pool are considered to be negative. This method will help with the cost of the trachoma elimination program.To determine whether infection recurs after mass treatment, we re-examined individuals in Tanzania five years after initiation of the MDA program. Treatment coverage was 80% for all ages in the first year. At five years, clinical trachoma rates were lower than at baseline, dropping to less than 45% compared to 81% at baseline. The prevalence of trachoma decreased in a linear fashion with number of years of mass treatment, and decreased prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was related to the extent of the previous years azithromycin coverage. Our model suggests that for communities with baseline trachoma prevalence of 50% and annual treatment coverage of 75%, at least 7 years of annual mass treatment will be needed to reach a prevalence of trachoma of <5%. In a sub-study of the Tanzania program, all children under 9 years in 4 villages were followed from baseline pre-mass treatment to six months post treatment. 1,991 children under nine years were enrolled in the longitudinal study. Baseline infection was 23.7% and at 6 months was 10.4%, despite 95% coverage. Infection at baseline was positively associated with infection at 6 months (OR = 3.31, 95%CI 2.40-4.56) and treatment had a protective effect (OR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.25-0.80). The age group 2-4 years had an increased risk of infection at 6 months. The household characteristics predictive of infection at 6 months were increasing number of children infected in the household at baseline and increasing number of untreated children in the household. None of the intervention communities met criteria to stop MDA. There was no difference in infection (2.9% vs. 4.7%; P = .25) between the usual care and cessation rule communities at 18 months. In this setting, communities with low (10%-20%) initial prevalence of active trachoma did not have MDA stopped before 3 annual rounds on the basis of monitoring for infection. Infection with C trachomatis in communities with average trachoma rates at 12% to 13% cannot be eliminated before 3 rounds of MDA with azithromycin.In districts prioritized for three MDA rounds with very low baseline levels of trachoma, one round of MDA reduced active trachoma to low levels and chlamydia infection was not detectable in any community. There was no additional benefit to giving two further rounds of MDA. Programs could save scarce resources by determining when to initiate or to discontinue MDA based on testing for Ct infection, and one round of MDA may be all that is necessary in some settings to reduce TF below the elimination threshold.\",\n",
       " 'The mosquito- and tick-borne viruses of the Flaviviridae family represent important emerging and reemerging pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), West Nile (WN), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses that have caused severe neuroinfections with up to 40% mortality in humans in many regions of the world. WN and SLE are endemic in North America, and WN is the major cause of viral encephalitis in the USA. During the 1999-2013 outbreaks, nearly 3 million people were infected with WN in the US, with about 17,500 reported cases of encephalitis/ meningitis that resulted in 1558 deaths, majority of which occurred in elderly. No established specific antiviral therapy or a licensed human vaccine is available to date to treat and prevent SLE and WN diseases. Also, despite the use of formalin-inactivated TBEV vaccines in endemic areas of Europe and Asia, an increasing incidence of tick-borne encephalitis during the past 2 decades emphasizes the need for an alternative vaccine that will induce a more durable immunity and protection against TBEV. The pathogenesis of neurotropic flavivirus infections involves two distinct properties of the viruses: (i) neuroinvasiveness, which relates to the capacity of the virus to replicate in the peripheral organs, induce viremia, and gain entry to the central nervous system (CNS) and (ii) neurovirulence, which is the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in cells of the CNS and cause encephalitis. In the CNS, the primary targets of neurotropic flaviviruses are neurons. Thus, successful attenuation of a neurotropic virus depends on the prevention of virus entry into the CNS and restriction of its replication in the neurons. The live attenuated TBEV, SLE, or WN vaccine candidates are being developed in the Neurotropic Flaviviruses Section of the LID using a strategy based on chimerization of a neurovirulent parental virus (TBEV, SLE, or WN) with a non-neuroinvasive dengue-4 flavivirus (DEN4) and an introduction of attenuating mutations. However, these chimeric viruses containing structural protein genes of a highly virulent parental virus exhibited a moderate or high level of neurovirulence in the developing CNS of newborn or immunodeficient mice compared to that observed for widely used live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine. Their further attenuation is required since a live vaccine against neurotropic virus should be fully restricted for replication in the CNS.In recent years, microRNA-targeting has become an effective strategy for selective control of tissue-tropism of both DNA and RNA viruses. In FY2013, we have demonstrated that certain miRNAs expressed in the brain can control the neurotropism and pathogeneses of neurovirulent TBEV/DEN4 virus bearing perfectly complementary miRNA target sites. The insertion of a single copy of a target for a brain-specific miRNA into the genome was sufficient to prevent the development of otherwise lethal encephalitis in adult mice infected intracerebrally with a large dose of virus.  However, the efficacy of miRNA-mediated inhibition of virus replication in the immature CNS of suckling mice depends on the genetic stability of the miRNA-targeted virus that can revert to a virulent phenotype. We found that the miRNA-targeting of TBEV/DEN4 genome in the 3-noncoding region (3NCR) or in the open reading frame (ORF) strongly attenuated viral neurovirulence in the developing mouse CNS. Importantly, virus escape from miRNA-mediated suppression occurs exclusively through the deletion of inserted miRNA-targets and results in the loss of the viral genome sequence located between the two most distant miRNA targets. In FY2014, we demonstrated that simultaneous miRNA co-targeting of the genome in the ORF and 3-NCR for brain-expressed miRNAs had an additive effect and produced a more potent attenuation of the TBEV/DEN4 virus compared to separate targeting of those regions. Multiple miRNA co-targeting of these two distantly located regions completely abolished the virus neurotropism as no viral replication was detected in the developing brain of neonatal mice. Furthermore, no viral antigens were detected in neurons, and neuronal integrity in the brain of mice was well preserved. Thus, we thought that the miRNA co-targeting approach can be adapted for other viruses in order to minimize their replication in a cell- or tissue-type specific manner, but most importantly, to prevent virus escape from miRNA-mediated silencing. In FY2014, principles of miRNA-targeting to control the virus replication in the CNS were applied to chimeric SLE/DEN4 and WN/DEN4 viruses. We generated SLE/DEN4 and WN/DEN4 cDNA genomes in which the miRNA targets for mir-9 and mir-124 in the E protein gene were combined with additional miRNA-targets located in three sites in the 3NCR. These viruses subsequently demonstrated to have reduced neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence as examined by intraperitoneal or intracerebreal infection of adult or suckling mice.Since flaviviruses are transmitted in the nature by their specific arthropod vector, the enviromental safety of live attenuated vaccines is a significant concern. The TBEV/DEN4-, SLE/DEN4- and WN/DEN4-miRNA-targeted viruses are based on the DEN4 genetic background and have a potential to be transmitted from vaccinated individuals via mosquito bite. In an effort to preclude introduction of a vaccine virus into the envroment, we explored the ability of the miRNAs expressed in Aedes mosquitoes to control DEN4 growth in salivary gland and midgut tissues. Insertion of 2, 3, or 4 targets for mosquito-specific, highly expressed miRNAs (aae-mir-184 and aae-mir-275) into the ORF and 3NCR restricts DEN4 replication in three mosquito cell lines and was enough to block the virus infectivity and dissemination in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which are the competent vectors for many arboviruses, including DEN viruses. Moreover, the combined co-targeting of the DEN4 genome for mosquito-specific miRNAs and miRNAs expressed in the brain of mice resulted in the complete silencing of DEN4 replication in two different species: mosquitoes and the CNS of mice. These results suggest that chimeric virus vaccines constructed on DEN4-genetic background with mosquito- and CNS-specific miRNA targets would not be transmitted from vaccinees to other hosts via mosquitoes and would be safe for both the recipient and the environment.The upsurge of WN human infections in 2012 and 2013 suggests that the US can expect periodic WN outbreaks in the future. Availability of safe and effective vaccines against WN in endemic areas, particularly for aging populations that are at high risk for West Nile neuroinvasive disease, could be beneficial. WN/DEN4d30 is a live, attenuated chimeric vaccine against WN developed in the NFS and was found to be well-tolerated, safe, and induced a potent and durable WN antibody response in healthy adult volunteers in Phase I clinical trials. In addition, clinical and virological data, as well as results of histopathological analysis, demonstrate that the WN vaccine virus is sufficiently attenuated for the CNS of nonhuman primates as compared to an attenuated flavivirus surrogate reference (i.e., yellow fever YF 17D vaccine). Because the majority of WN neuroinvasive disease occurs in persons older than 60, we initiated a Phase I clinical trial in 2014 at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in the at-risk group of elderly volunteers. These studies were designed in order to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of WN vaccine in the adults >50 years of age and determine if a second dose of vaccine will improve either the seroconversion frequency or the durability of the antibody response.',\n",
       " \"Background: Dengue infections rank second among infectious diseases that afflict US Military personnel deployed overseas. Developing a successful vaccine to prevent dengue infections is a Priority Research Area for the Fiscal Year 2014 Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program (JWMRP) and the US Department of Defense (DoD). Recent disappointing results from clinical trials of Sanofi Pasteur's CYD vaccine highlight the importance of continued development using novel platforms and strategies. The Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) has pioneered in the development of dengue vaccines using alternate platforms. Our DNA-based vaccine was recently found to be safe and well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical trials. Although humoral immune responses were minimal, the vaccine elicited T cell responses. The low humoral response is attributed to the low dose of vaccine and the mode of delivery. The current proposal will test different modes of delivery of NMRC's DNA vaccine and a heterologous prime boost approach to achieving protective levels of immune responses. If successful, a promising approach to vaccination against dengue infections will be ready for Investigational New Drug-enabling studies at the end of this project.Objectives: Objectives of this proposal are to (a) test different modes of delivery of dengue DNA vaccine for optimal humoral and T cell responses, and (b) to test the optimal delivery method in conjunction with other vaccine platforms using a heterologous prime-boost regimen.Specific Aims: (1) Compare intramuscular needle delivery (traditional) of DNA vaccine with intramuscular and intradermal delivery using needle-free liquid jet system and in vivo electroporation system. (2) Employ the best DNA delivery method identified above in a prime-boost vaccination approach using live attenuated virus vaccine (Takeda Pharmaceuticals) and inactivated virus vaccine (Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/NMRC).Study Design: The preclinical evaluations will be done using cynomolgous macaques. Groups of animals (n=4) will be immunized with two doses of DNA vaccine (1 mg and 5 mg) delivered IM needle, IM-Biojector, IM-electroporation, ID-Biojector, ID-eletroporation. Humoral and cellular immune responses will be measured and compared. The dose and mode of vaccination that produce the best combination of humoral and cellular immune responses will be selected for the next study. In the next study, groups of animals (n=6) will be vaccinated with different combinations of DNA, LAV, and inactivated virus vaccine. Humoral and cellular immune responses will be monitored throughout the course of study. About 6 months (24 weeks) after final vaccinations, all animals will be challenged with the serotype of dengue virus for which the lowest responses were recorded. Viremia in control and vaccinated animals will be measured. It is argued that if protection is achieved against the serotype for which lowest responses were recorded, the vaccine will be protective against other dengue serotypes also. Successful methods and/or combination of vaccines will be selected for further clinical development.Military Benefit: Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapies for dengue infections. A successful dengue vaccine is a priority to US DoD. Significant preclinical development of vaccines proposed in this project has already been completed. If successful, this strategy will lead to clinical trials of new strategies within a short period of time. A licensed dengue vaccine will greatly benefit the US Military and the public at large.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Language and communicative impairments following stroke (aphasia) affect more than 30% of stroke survivors, with an incidence of over 180,000 new cases annually. The consequences of aphasia are far reaching and can affect psychosocial adjustment, family role participation, vocational opportunities, and the ability to function independently in society.  Recent estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year, meaning that approximately 20,000 enrolled VHA patients and 100,000 United States Veterans are currently living with the condition. In response to this need, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) initiated the Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (PIRATE) in January 2009.  PIRATE is a clinical demonstration project that provides approximately 100 hours of cognitive- linguistically oriented aphasia treatment to community dwelling Veterans over a 4-week period.  PIRATE currently serves 18 Veterans per year in bi-monthly sessions. Resource limitations associated with PIRATE and aphasia treatment in general require that treatments be offered in the most cost-effective doses to those Veterans most likely to benefit from them.   The proposed treatment-effectiveness research addresses these issues by examining the dose-response relationship for semantically-oriented naming treatment, and identifying cognitive, psycholinguistic and neuroanatomical predictors of treatment success. Study participants (n=50, over a 4-year period) will be recruited nationwide from Veterans enrolled in PIRATE. They will have their naming performance measured prior to PIRATE entry, during each week of treatment, and at program exit/follow-up. A battery of cognitive measures and structural magnetic resonance images of their brains will also be collected prior to treatment. Participants' performance on trained and untrained lexical items and a standardized measure of naming performance will be compared across time intervals to specify the therapy amounts for which maximum treatment benefits are achieved. Their treatment outcomes will also be correlated with specific cognitive test scores and the location and extent of their brain lesions to identify cognitive and neurological markers predictive of positive treatment response. Treatment response will also be compared across participants with different psycholinguistic profiles, to determine which groups of patients show greatest benefit from semantically-oriented naming treatment.   The proposed research should provide answers to two interlocking questions: for whom  is aphasia therapy most effective, and how much of it is needed to optimize treatment  outcomes. These answers have the potential to set transformative new standards for how aphasia treatment is delivered within VHA.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Aphasia occurs in more than 30% of stroke survivors, including 100,000 United States Veterans, and can reduce participation in a wide range of valued life activities. This treatment- effectiveness study examines the dosages needed for positive response to treatment of naming impairments in aphasia, and cognitive and brain correlates of treatment success, within the context of the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System's Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (PIRATE). Study participants' performance on standardized and treatment-related measures will be compared across 4 weeks of treatment, to specify the therapy amounts for which maximum benefits are achieved. Their treatment outcomes will also be correlated with measures of cognitive performance and the location and extent of their brain lesions to identify cognitive and neurological markers of positive treatment response.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic infection mediates premature T cell aging through regulation of microRNAs and leading to blunted vaccine responses, with an aim to develop effective approaches to improve vaccine efficacy in virus-infected individuals. To this end, we will use a model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine failure in the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The proposal is based on the fact that co-infection of HBV with HCV and/or HIV is common due to shared risk factors, and as such HBV vaccine is required to prevent super-infection and its associated increase in morbidity and mortality; however, vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals are often blunted. This phenomenon is also observed in the elderly, who frequently fail to respond to vaccinations and attempts to improve the rate of immunizations in both infected and aged populations have been unsuccessful. This is in part due to our poor understanding of the mechanisms that inhibit vaccine responses in these settings. In studying the effect of viral infection on T cell functions, we and others have recently found that chronic HCV infection leads to T cell dysfunction mediated through up-regulation of aging markers, including killer cell lectin- like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) and dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), concomitant with a decline of microRNA-181a (miR181) levels in CD4 T cells. Remarkably, these alterations are associated with impaired CD4 T cell functions in HCV-infected individuals and are more prominent in HBV vaccine non- responders (HBV-NR) compared to age-matched HBV vaccine responders (HBV-R). With increasing age, KLRG1 is up-regulated and leads to inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, whereas DUSP6 is increased and leads to recalibration of the TCR activation threshold; miR181 declines to permit translation of a set of genes related to T cell inhibition. However, the mechanisms underlying miR181/KLRG1/DUSP6 expression and regulation of premature T cell aging and vaccine responses during HCV infection remain unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that HCV-induced loss of miR181 mediates premature T cell aging by up-regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expressions, such that targeting these inhibitory pathways may rescue impaired CD4 T cell functions and subsequently boost blunted vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the following three specific aims: Aim 1 will define theepigenetic, transcriptional and translational mechanisms that control miR181 expression in T cells during HCV infection; Aim 2 will determine the role of miR181 in regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expression in T cells during HCV infection; Aim 3 will examine the consequences of miR181 loss and KLRG1/DUSP6 expression in T cell function and vaccine response in virus-infected individuals. This translational study is significant in that it provides a working model t explore mechanisms that may be fundamental to diminished vaccine responses in general, particularly in the setting of immunocompromise by HIV, hemodialysis, transplantation, and cancer.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, more than 400 million people suffer from malarial infection worldwide, leading to at least 1 million deaths, most attributable to Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent of the human infective malaria parasites. Effective control of malaria will require development and application of an efficacious malaria vaccine. Unfortunately, efforts in developing a malaria vaccine over many decades have yielded limited success. The most advanced vaccine to date, RTS,S, which is based on a P. falciparum antigen expressed during the initial infection and during liver stage development, is currently in Phase II trials. In the most recent analysis RTS,S achieved less than 20% efficacy; other vaccine constructs and antigenic targets have had even lower success rates. Thus, new platforms for antigen delivery should be investigated to improve vaccine efficacy. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), a paramyxovirus, is thought to be a contributing factor for causing kennel cough in dogs and is not known to cause any illness in humans. Several characteristics of PIV5 make it an attractive vaccine vector. First, kennel cough vaccines containing live PIV5 have been used in dogs for over 30 years. Humans are likely exposed to this virus due to close contact to dogs. In our preliminary studies, we have found that about 30 percent of humans have neutralizing antibodies against PIV5; however, no recorded illness in humans has been attributed to the virus. Second, PIV5 can be produced in high titers in many cells, including Vero cells that have been approved for vaccine production. Third, PIV5 can infect human cell lines and primary human cells. Fourth, in our recent study, we have found that pre-existing immunity against PIV5 does not negatively affect immunity generated by a PIV5-based vaccine. Fifth, a single dose immunization of PIV5 expressing HA, an antigen of influenza virus, protects against lethal influenza virus challenge in mice, and a single dose immunization of PIV5 expressing G, an antigen of rabies virus, protects lethal rabies virus challenge in mice. Also, PIV5 expressing the NP protein of influenza virus (PIV5-NP) provides broad protection against different subtypes of influenza viruses. Compared to the most commonly used viral vectors such as adenovirus (AdV)- or vaccinia virus (VV)-based vectors expressing NP, PIV5 is the most efficacious. Together, these results demonstrate that PIV5 is an effective vaccine vector. Finally, needle free administration (intranasal and oral) immunization is an advantage as a vaccine vector for malaria since endemic areas are often resources-limited. We hypothesize that PIV5 is an effective vaccine vector for malaria. In this proposal, we plan to demonstrate the proof-of principal for using PIV5 as a vector for malaria vaccine development. We will focus our efforts on the following specific aims: 1) Generate and analyze recombinant PIV5 expressing human malaria antigen CSP; and 2) Evaluate immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant viruses in vivo.',\n",

By utilizing the knowledge that I gain from this proposed work, I hope to develop my career in a direction independently of my mentor and begin to work on the rational design of a hepatitis C virus vaccine. My surroundings at Vanderbilt are ideal for my proposed project and my career development. The intellectual environment could not be better, and I intend to take full advantage of this by attending a structured program of coursework. My mentor's laboratory has a tremendous amount of experience isolating and studying human monoclonal antibodies, central to my proposal and to the concept of rational vaccine design. My mentor, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center, also has great expertise in vaccinology, immunology, and viral pathogenesis. While at Vanderbilt and under his mentorship, my work has been rapidly evolving so as to launch my career as an independent investigator. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges in disease severity from an influenza-like illness to life-threatening shock. One model of the mechanism underlying severe disease proposes that weakly cross-reactive antibodies induced during a primary infection facilitate virus entry into Fc receptor-bearing cells during a subsequent secondary infection. This is thought to increase viral replication and release of cytokines and vasoactive mediators, culminating in shock. This unique process, known as antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, has significantly hindered vaccine development. There is a concern that potent neutralizing antibodies must be generated to all four dengue virus serotypes, as a vaccine that induces weakly cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies may increase the likelihood of developing severe disease upon re-exposure. Much of our understanding of this process has come from studies using mouse mAbs. However, antibody responses in mice typically exhibit less complexity than those in humans. A better understanding of the humoral immune response to natural dengue virus infection in humans is sorely needed. Using a high-efficiency human hybridoma technology developed in our laboratory, it is now possible to generate human hybridomas reliably with B cells from the peripheral blood of individuals who have recovered from an infection. Employing this technology, we have generated over 250 hybridomas secreting human mAbs to dengue virus from subjects who had recovered from primary or secondary infection. The vast majority of these antibodies are broadly serotype cross-reactive, directed against either envelope or pre-membrane protein, and capable of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection. Interestingly, very rare serotype-specific, potently neutralizing antibodies, which are nearly devoid of enhancing activity, are also produced by humans in response to infection. Understanding the epitopes and activity of these naturally-occurring antibodies is critical for vaccine development, as vaccines that induce high potency neutralizing antibodies that lack enhancing activity are desirable. Ideally, the reactivity of epitopes bound byenhancing antibodies should be reduced or eliminated in candidate antigens during the rational development of a dengue vaccine, so as to discourage such dominant recognition of these antigenic features by the humoral immune response. The long-term goal is to use such molecular information in the rational design of dengue vaccines that enhance the induction of protective neutralizing antibodies and reduce the risk of development of severe disease.\",\n",

       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this application, we will test the hypothesis that the Bcl6 gene, specifically in macrophages, inhibits host antiviral immunity and promotes host susceptibility to influenza virus infection. We will also explore whether the inhibition of Bcl6 function will enhance host anti-viral immunity to influenza and ameliorate severe host diseases during influenza virus infection. Two specific aims have been proposed. Specific Aim 1: To elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which Bcl6 deletion in macrophages attenuates influenza virus infection. Specific Aim 2: To determine if the inhibition of Bcl6 expression and/orfunction promotes macrophage IFN production and increase host resistance to influenza virus infection. The successful completion of this application will not only shed light on novel mechanisms of influenza pathogenesis and immune protection, but also open the door to developing novel therapeutic modalities against influenza infection in the near future. Relevance statement Seasonal influenza kills ~500,000 people globally and up to 50,000 people in the United States each year. In addition to seasonal outbreaks, pandemic influenza viruses occasionally emerge when humans are introduced to a virus to which they are immunologically naïve. Over the last decade, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N9) have emerged and recent data have highlighted the serious threat of another potential devastating influenza pandemic involving highly pathogenic virus strains. Current strategies for influenza prevention and treatment include yearly vaccination and anti-viral drugs. However, frequent changes in the surface antigens of influenza virus allow influenza viruses to escape antibody-mediated immune protection following vaccination and many circulating influenza virus strains have developed resistance to the current antiviral drugs. Thus, there is urgent need to understand the pathophysiology and the protective immune responses to influenza virus infection for the development of future preventive and therapeutic approaches. We believe that the novel method we employ here may provide alternative therapeutic modalities to those influenza virus strains that have already developed resistance to current anti-viral drugs.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunity to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) following infection is complex, and not fully protective against reactivation and reinfection with new strains. Because of the lifelong disabilities caused by congenital CMV infection, understanding the host defense determinants that protect the developing fetus is critical, toward the goal of developing an effective preconception vaccine. Clinical trials of an adjuvanted glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine showed protection in young women of childbearing age, but waning immunity and modest efficacy (~50%) necessitate consideration of other strategies. Recent evidence suggests that the CMV pentameric complex (PC) of proteins (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131) may be a more efficacious vaccine target, since antibodies to the PC potently block virus entry into epithelial and endothelial cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to use a relevant small animal model of congenital CMV transmission, the guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) model, to identify the optimal vaccine strategy for protection against fetal virus transmission. Toward this goal, Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a novel recombinant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV)-vectored PC vaccine will confer improved protection when compared to a combination rLCMV-vectored gB/GP83 (pp65 homolog) vaccine, and to an MPL adjuvanted recombinant gB vaccine. Both subcutaneous (Aim 1a) and transmucosal/intravaginal (Aim 1b) routes of virulent salivary gland- passaged GPCMV virus challenge will be evaluated in vaccinated and control animals to identify the optimal protective strategy. This will represent thefirst evaluation of an LCMV vaccine in an animal model of congenital CMV infection. Interferon-γ ELISPOT and a novel high-throughput luminex bDNA cytokine assay will explore correlates of immunity that are associated with protection against placental transmission. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that an LCMV-vectored PC vaccine also confers superior protection, compared to gB/GP83 vaccine, against virus-induced hearing loss memory/spatial neurocognitive deficits (using a Barnes maze model) following sublethal challenge during pregnancy. This study will represent the first animal model evaluation of a prenatal vaccine to prevent congenital CMV-induced hearing loss, and will increase the clinical relevance of the GPCMV model. Another area of complexity in CMV vaccines is the phenomena of re-infection. It has become increasingly clear that, in spite of previous immunity, women can become re-infected with new strains of CMV in pregnancy, and these strains can be transmitted to the fetus, leading to injury. Therefore, in Aim 3, we will utilize a newly discovered heterotypic strain of GPCMV, the CIDMTR strain, to model re-infection studies in the guinea pig. We will test whether LCMV PC vaccination can protect against re-infection and fetal transmission with improved efficacy when compared to adjuvanted gB vaccine. Since most congenital CMV infections occur in the context of non-primary maternal infections, these studies will substantially advance the field, and clarifythe requirements of an effective congenital CMV vaccine for women of childbearing potential.',\n",

       " 'The Ebola virus infection begins when viruses enter specific cells in the body, through a process involving binding to the cell surface followed by fusion during which the virus releases its genetic material into the cell. If either binding or fusion is interrupted, the virus will no longer be able to cause infection. The main objective of this work is to develop therapeutics that block virus fusion to the cell. To accomplish this, the PI will use a novel in vitro platform that allows her to screen for virus fusion preventing compounds.  At the conclusion of this work, the benefit to society will be: 1) a screening tool that can be readily adapted to discover compounds to combat future viral outbreaks, and 2) antibody candidates that can be used to stop the progression of the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. Additionally, the investigators will interact with the public to provide information about the Ebola virus, its infection process, and factors that contribute to outbreaks such as the current one.  Technical Abstract: At present, there are no available screening tools that can directly test the efficacy of anti-fusogenic compounds against Ebola. The fusion step is an especially promising target for therapeutics, as the fusion domain of Ebola virus spike protein (GP) evolves much slower than its binding domain. To address the urgent national need to identify compounds that stop Ebola virus infection, the PI proposes to (1) create a rapid screening platform for anti-fusogenic compounds against Ebola virus; and (2) identify antibodies and compounds that disrupt the fusion function of GP. The PI will adapt a microfluidic virus fusion assay platform based on her previous work using single particle tracking (SPT) approaches to investigate enveloped virus fusion. The platform consists of a multi-channel microfluidic device with host cell mimics coated on the channel walls (referred to as a supported lipid bilayer, SLB), and virus (or virus-like particles, VLPs) containing Ebola virus GP protein that can fuse with the SLB. This technology directly probes viral fusion in a high-throughput manner and provides quantitative information on the fusion mechanism. It is anticipated that this platform can be used for the rapid screening and identification of anti-fusogenic antiviral compounds against Ebola virus. In addition, the PIs will participate in public discourse about the virus, providing information about the infection process and providing perspective about the outbreak through such activities as presentations to the medical staff at the regional hospital (Cayuga Medical Center) as part of their Continuing Education Series and Ebola-response plan.',\n",
       " 'Foot and mouth disease is distributed world-wide in over 100 countries, and has proven to be devastating to livestock of cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, and buffaloes. Similar to other members of the Picornaviridae family, there is considerable natural genetic variation in the FMDV population found in nature. There are seven serotypes of the foot and mouth disease virus, and many antigenically variable viral sub-types. The serotypes are not evenly distributed throughout the world, necessitating different vaccine cocktails for each region (Doel 2003; Li et al, 2012). From endemic transmission, approximately 24 million cattle are affected each year and over 3 million pigs are affected by FMD every year throughout the world. Outbreaks in FMD-free countries, of which there were 10 in 2011 and 2012, cost approximately $1.5 billion each year (Knight-Jones, 2013). This represents a huge market potential. FMDV-free countries seek to maintain stockpiles of vaccine to protect from a potential outbreak. There are many countries seeking to regain FMDV-free status that would be interested in an effective new FMDV vaccine.The current FMDV vaccine is an inactivated virus formulation combined with an adjuvant to improve immunity. It requires an expensive manufacturing process in a high biosafety containment facility and confers only temporary immunity in vaccinated animals. Because in part of the inefficacy of vaccines produced using conventional technology, countries sometimes elect to control outbreaks without the use of vaccination programs. The current inactivated vaccine uses technology dating back to 1937 that has not been significantly refined since the 1970s. The current vaccine also has a short shelf life and requires continuous cold storage, contraindicating its use in developing tropical countries where FMDV is a severe problem (Rodriguez and Grubman, 2009).Codagenix Inc. core technology is based on rational, computer-aided gene design, and is termed Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE). SAVE generates live-attenuated viruses that are 100% antigenically identical to wildtype virus (Mueller et al., 2009). SAVE was developed in the poliovirus (Mueller et al. 2006) (Coleman et al., 2008), validated for live attenuated Influenza A vaccine candidates (Mueller et al., 2010), and shown to yield an Influenza A vaccine capable of an ultra-low, cross-protective vaccinating dose in mice (Yang et al., 2013). Our approach would use a highly attenuated live virus, which could require less production because of greater efficacy (Large amounts of live FMDV need to be grown to make the currentvaccine formulation). Inactivated vaccines use wild-type viruses; if the inactivation step is unsuccessful then fully virulent FMDV would be unleashed on a herd, creating a new outbreak instead of preventing one. An attenuated, stable, live vaccine does not have this risk. We have previously succeeded in making vaccines that require no adjuvant and that are efficacious with a single dose (Coleman et al, 2008; Yang et al, 2013).A successful live attenuated FMDV vaccine should fulfill a set of essential criteria. The vaccine should be rapidly effective to help halt the spread of an outbreak; this means that the vaccine should be effective at inducing immunity after single dose and preventing the shedding of infectious virus, ideally within a week as FMDV infection requires 3-5 days to become infectious (Sanson et al., 2011). Additional factors are important for broad application and distribution of a vaccine candidate; the vaccine should be effective against a spectrum of different serotypes and sub-types, it should prevent a carrier state from developing in an infected animals, and the vaccine formulation should be highly stable. For safety, the vaccine candidate should be capable of being manufactured without the use of a wild-type, virulent virus. To assist in eradication, the immunity induced by vaccination should be long-lived in order to prevent reinfection of the animal (Rodriguez and Grubman, 2009).',\n",
       " 'Swine morbidity and mortality caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus is a threat to the U.S. pork industry causing losses of $664 million last year that may exceed $700 million in 2014. Vaccines against PRRS virus have failed to stem the occurrence of PRRS in U.S. herds. Here we propose to ascertain the technical feasibility of developing an effective autogenous (killed virus) vaccine. Aptimmune&#39;s approach to prepare an atuogenous PRRS virus vaccine consists of using the proprietary porcine alveolar macrophage cell line, named ZMAC, as the cell substrate for both the isolation of field PRRS virus from a clinical sample and the production of the PRRS virus stocks to produce the viral antigen for the vaccine. Since the ZMAC cell line can be used to reliably and swiftly produce autogenous PRRS vaccines from wild-type (field) PRRS virus, it provides to Aptimmune a major competitive advantage. Since the ZMAC cell line is of the same species as the animal in which the vaccine will be used we have termed this new class of PRRS autogenous vaccine as Homologous Cell Autogenous Vaccine (HCAV).We have selected several commercially available adjuvants to formulate our HCAV. We will test these alternative vaccine formulations for their ability to stimulate virus-inhibitory immunity. We expect that our strategy to explore several alternative formulations of a PRRS HCAV will lead to the identification of an effective autogenous vaccine capable of eliciting strong levels of protective immunity against PRRS virus. The expected results of Phase I include: 1) a process for production of an autogenous virus vaccine starting from a clinical sample in 5 weeks or less; 2) identify an optimal formulation for a PRRS HCAV that elicits strong virus inhibitory immunity.The expected outcome is the development of a production process to manufacture in a timely manner an effective autogenous vaccine against PRRS virus. Ultimately, the commercial availability of an effective autogenous PRRS vaccine should result in application of effective management strategies that successfully control the spread of PRRS virus and incidence of PRRS outbreaks. The availability of an effective vaccine against PRRS will mitigate the significant economic impact that this disease has to the American pork industry and thus increase its profitability.',\n",

       " 'Ongoing research focuses on the exploration of pathologic inflammatory responses to acute respiratory virus infection and the use of this information to develop creative strategies to circumvent these lethal sequelae characteristic of this disease.Our first original research publication features our ongoing interest in the immunomodulatory properties of Lactobacillus at the respiratory mucosa and protection against acute respiratory virus infection.  We reported previously that priming of the respiratory tract with immunobiotic Lactobacillus prior to virus challenge protects mice against subsequent lethal infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). We present here the results of gene microarray which document differential expression of proinflammatory mediators in response to PVM infection alone and those suppressed in response to Lactobacillus plantarum. We also demonstrate for the first time that intranasal inoculation with live or heat-inactivated L. plantarum or Lactobacillus reuteri promotes full survival from PVM infection when administered within 24h after virus challenge. Survival in response to L. plantarum administered after virus challenge is associated with suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, limited virus recovery, and diminished neutrophil recruitment to lung tissue and airways. Utilizing this novel post-virus challenge protocol, we found that protective responses elicited by L. plantarum at the respiratory tract were distinct from those at the gastrointestinal mucosa, as mice devoid of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, exhibit survival and inflammatory responses that are indistinguishable from those of their wild-type counterparts. Finally, although L. plantarum interacts specifically with pattern recognition receptors TLR2 and NOD2, the respective gene-deleted mice were fully protected against lethal PVM infection by L. plantarum administration, as are mice devoid of type I interferon receptors. Taken together, L. plantarum is a versatile and flexible agent that is capable of averting the lethal sequelae of severe respiratory infection both prior to and post-virus challenge via complex and potentially redundant mechanisms (Percopo et al., 2015, Antiviral Res. 121, 109-119).As part of our long-term collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Paul Foster, we contributed to an original research study of the systemic impact of PVM infection.  In this study, we determined that, even if virus replication is limited to the lung tissue, the impact of the infection itself could be broad-reaching and systemic. In this specific study, we assessed the impact of acute pneumovirus infection in C57BL/6 mice on   hematopoiesis taking place in the bone marrow.  We hypothesized that inflammatory cytokine production in the lung upregulates myeloid cell production in response to infection. Specifically, we demonstrated a dramatic increase in the percentages of circulating myeloid cells in association with pronounced elevations in inflammatory cytokines in serum, bone, and lung tissue.  Increased percentages of hematopoietic stem cells were detected, accompanied by an increase in the proportions of committed myeloid progenitors, as determined by colony-forming unit assays. However, no functional changes in hematopoietic stem cells occurred, as assessed by competitive bone marrow reconstitution. Systemic administration of neutralizing Abs to either TNF-alpha; or IFN-gamma; blocked expansion of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow and also limited virus clearance from the lung. These findings suggest that acute inflammatory cytokines drive production and differentiation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow by inducing differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms via which innate immune responses regulate myeloid cell progenitor numbers in response to acute respiratory virus infection  (Maltby et al., 2014, J. Immunol. 193:4072-4082).',\n",
       " \"(1) To develop animal disease (end host) and persistence (reservoir host) models:Over the past two years we have developed and characterized nonhuman primate disease models for infections with influenza A viruses, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and hantaviruses causing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS).  The two nonhuman primate MERS models, rhesus macaque and common marmoset, were further investigated. A comparative pathology study was performed to increase our understanding why disease in the rhesus macaque is mild-moderate, whereas disease in the common marmoset is moderate-severe. The results suggested that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection play a role in the severity of pulmonary pathology. We also investigated whether domestic pigs could be used as an alternative MERS model. Pigs were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose of MERS-CoV. Unexpectedly, pigs did not develop signs of disease nor lesions in the respiratory tract. We have also further characterized the rhesus macaque HPS model to investigate mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. We are currently studying specific inflammatory events to gain understanding of what contributes to disease as well as to develop a therapeutic. Much of our work on hantaviruses in the past year was aimed at determining how the natural reservoirs are able to support high levels of virus replication without disease. We have previously shown that Sin Nombre virus elicits an initial inflammatory response in deer mice, the natural reservoir, but this response turned into an active anti-inflammatory response, as indicated by the activity of virus-specific T regulatory cells. Currently we are determining the requirement of these T regulatory cells to the suppression of the anti-inflammatory response by using T cell depletion strategies. (2) To identify and characterize determinants of viral pathogenicity to develop antivirals:Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. In order to study a potentiating effect of co-infection we performed a study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 showed enhanced clinical disease. Similar studies were performed with a seasonal H3N2 virus and MRSA, in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement. Studies to decipher the mechanisms behind these observations were objectives over the past year and are still ongoing. Comorbidities are frequently reported in severe MERS cases. Thus, we tested the effect of immunosuppression on outcome of MERS-CoV infection in the rhesus macaque model. Animals were immunosuppressed through treatment with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone before MERS-CoV inoculation. Immunosuppressed macaques did not develop more severe disease than immunocompetent animals, but they shed more virus, and viral loads in the lungs were significantly higher. Despite the increased virus replication, and in line with lack of increase in clinical disease, histological examination of the lungs showed a reduced inflammatory response in immunosuppressed macaques as compared to normal animals. These results suggested that the immune response to infection plays an important role in MERS-CoV pathogenesis. A novel henipavirus, Cedar paromyxovirus (CedPV) has been isolated from pteropus bats in Australia that is closely related to Nipah virus but has not been associated with human disease. To elucidate mechanisms of disease induced by Nipah virus, we have begun to use the hamster model of henipavirus disease to characterize and compare infection and pathogenesis. CedPV replicated in hamsters, yet did not cause any conspicuous pathology. In vitro studies suggest that CedPV elicits a strong innate immune response, whereas Nipah antagonizes this response, allowing for unchecked virus replication, resulting in massive cytopathology. These studies will continue and hopeful provide new insight into henipavirus pathogenesis that can be used to develop antivirals/therapeutics. (3) To identify and characterize host responses to viral infection to develop therapeutics:For MERS, a first treatment study using a combination of ribavirin and interferon was performed in the rhesus macaque model showing efficacy as demonstrated by reduced clinical disease signs and viral load in lung tissue. In collaboration with the Molecular Targets Program at NCI, griffithsin, a novel viral entry inhibitor, was identified as having potent (EC50 5nM) activity against MERS-CoV. The post-exposure efficacy of nebulized griffithsin in the rhesus macaque model showed moderate reduction of viral load but did not significantly reduce disease signs. We are currently refining the treatment scheme. We are also in the process of testing the efficacy of several monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as a treatment for MERS-CoV infection in the common marmoset. These mAb have shown efficacy in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection and, if shown to reduce disease burden in the common marmoset model, can quickly be used in patients. (4) To develop protective vaccines:We continued with our efforts to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses. We currently are applying two approaches: i) expression of highly conserved B cell epitopes from two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk that have shown to afford heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region to increase antibody responses against otherwise poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector platform for these studies, which is able to induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody). Unfortunately, first attempts using the mouse model of influenza A viruses were rather discouraging. We will continue to optimize the CMV platform but also started to use the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as an alternative platform. For MERS, we have obtained very encouraging results with a DNA vaccine platform encoding a codon-optimized consensus spike protein. This vaccine candidate induced potent cellular immunity and antigen specific neutralizing antibodies in three animal species, mice, macaques and camels. Vaccinated macaques were protected against MERS-CoV challenge and did not show any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia. The vaccine candidate will be further tested for its use in emergency situations to prevent MERS-CoV infection.  In an effort to generate an effective countermeasure for Nipah virus infection, we used the VSV based vaccine approach to express one of the glycoproteins of Nipah virus as an immunogen. These vaccines elicited strong antibody responses in hamsters and protected them from lethal, high dose Nipah virus challenge. We also showed efficacy of one of these VSV vaccines in the African green monkey model. Furthermore, we were able to characterize the T cell response to vaccination and challenge and showed that not only is a strong neutralizing response elicited, but the vaccine primes the CD8+ T cell response as well. To investigate the limits of the efficacy of this vaccine, we used the hamster model and showed that this vaccine provides at least partial protection when given as late as on the day of virus challenge. Future work will examine the mechanisms of protection and test the vaccine's peri-exposure efficacy in nonhuman primates.\",\n",
       " \"(A) Study pathogenesis and pathophysiology of high biocontainment viral pathogens utilizing molecular technologies including reverse genetics systems: Filoviruses: The Syrian hamster model for Ebola virus infection displays almost all hallmark features of human disease including coagulopathy. Using this model, we have investigated the mechanisms in which hamsters are protected from wild-type Ebola virus infection and determined that a CD4+ T cell response, facilitating a neutralizing antibody response, is responsible for natural immunity. Ebola virus uses transcriptional editing to express several glycoproteins from a single gene. Recombinant viruses predominantly expressing the transmembrane glycoprotein are known to rapidly mutate and acquire an editing site predominantly expressing a soluble form of the glycoprotein, suggesting an important role of this protein. Using reverse genetics, however, we could show that the soluble glycoprotein is not required for virulence in the guinea pig model. Utilizing mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC), a panel of reproducible, recombinant inbred strains spanning the genetic breadth of three murine subspecies, we could demonstrate variation in susceptibility to distinct disease phenotypes following Ebola virus infection. In contrast to C57BL/6J mice, which develop lethal disease without coagulopathies, CC recombinant inbred intercross (CC-RIX) lines develop either complete resistance to lethal disease or lethal disease characterized by prolonged coagulation times. Transcriptomics revealed that the host responses dependent on genetic background determine susceptibility to infection independent of virus replication.(B) Study immune responses to infection and vaccination of high containment viral pathogens and develop new vaccine candidates:Arenaviruses: Vaccine development has continued with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform expressing the Josiah strain glycoprotein. Depletion studies in the cynomolgus macaque model indicated the importance of cellular and humoral immunity for protection mediated by the VSV based vaccine. Furthermore, we could demonstrate protection against challenge with geographically and genetically distinct Lassa viruses. Thus, the VSV based vaccine platform can be considered a pan-Lassa vaccine approach and GMP production has been initiated. In addition, we have started a project focused on the elimination of Lassa virus from the reservoir species, Mastomys natalensis. For this we use two vaccine platforms, a recombinant attenuated strain of Salmonella and a recombinant cytomegalovirus vector, to immunize the peri-domestic reservoir with the hope to block Lassa virus transmission among rodents and to humans. Bunyaviruses: We have continued to characterize and optimize the adenovirus based vaccine for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF). Ongoing transfer and depletion studies using the adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the nucleoprotein or glycoproteins of CCHF virus indicated that antibodies are the mechanism of protection. We also developed a VSV-based vaccine expressing the CCHF glycoprotein. Characterization and efficacy testing are ongoing.Filoviruses: The VSV vaccine efforts are reported under the 'Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine' project. In the meantime, we have proceeded with the development of alternative vaccine candidates for Ebola and Marburg viruses. One of the approaches is based on a whole-virus vaccine using an Ebola virus lacking an indispensable gene encoding for the virion protein VP30. This vaccine showed promising protection in the macaque model following a single administration. Protection was also achieved after prime-boost immunization with an inactivated form of the whole-virus vaccine. Another approach is targeted towards wildlife, in particular the great apes, using the concept of a disseminating vaccine vector. The idea is the introduction of a recombinant CMV expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Proof-of-concept studies have been successful in the mouse and rhesus macaque model using a murine and rhesus CMV vector, respectively.  Very recently, we have started to investigate a vaccine based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing filovirus-like particles; preliminary rodent experiments have resulted in promising results.  (C) Study vector/reservoir transmission of high containment viral pathogens using appropriate animal models:Arenaviruses: Over the past months we have established a Mastomys natalensis colony at Rocky Mountain Laboratories using animals imported from Mali. This unique resource will allow us to study infection and transmission in the natural reservoir species. The colony is susceptible to infection which different Lassa strains and infection leads to temporal virus persistence followed by clearance. More recent studies include temporal analysis of Lassa-Soromba infection in adult Mastomys as well as vertical and horizontal transmission among animals. (D) Utilize in vitro and in vivo systems to study the interactions between viral pathogen or viral components and host cells and develop new antiviral strategies: Arenaviruses: We have tested the efficacy of two antivirals, T-705 and ribavirin, in the guinea pig model of Lassa virus infection. In particular, T-705 showed promise as a treatment for Lassa virus with protection even when treatment was started post-disease onset (daily dose of 300mg/kg).  Studies testing the efficacy of T-705 against Lujo virus, a recently emerged arenavirus, will begin shortly. Filoviruses: Ribavirin can effectively extend the time-to-death of hamsters infected with Ebola virus, but resistance will rapidly develop. Surprisingly, T-705 protected hamsters against Ebola virus infection when animals were treated for two weeks beginning the day after infection. This promising treatment option is currently being followed up. We have also identified a few promising broad spectrum antivirals against Ebola virus, which are in development as treatment options for other RNA viruses. Further confirmation is underway. In contrast, treatment with anti-malaria drugs, including chloroquine, failed in Ebola rodent models and should not be further considered. We have continued to develop novel experimental systems that allow modeling of the filo- and arenavirus life cycle over multiple infectious cycles without the need for a high containment laboratory. We have started to utilize those systems for drug screening experiments to identify viral and host factors involved in virus replication. Preliminary data have identified several host factors and we are in the process to confirm their contribution to virus replication. These systems will be extremely helpful for future drug development efforts. (E) Study the epidemiology and ecology of high biocontainment pathogens utilizing newly developed rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic test systems including those that can be applied under field conditions:Arenaviruses: Studies regarding the ecology and epidemiology of Lassa virus are reported under the Mali ICER project. Filoviruses: Over the past fiscal year we have established and operated a diagnostic laboratory in Monrovia, Liberia to support the international response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa. For this, we have established molecular and serological detection assays that were transferred from our ICER field sites. In addition, we established and supported an Ebola diagnostic laboratory in Bamako, Mali. Overall, we have analyzed over 5000 specimens at both locations. Our work in West Africa has further contributed to a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of Ebola. Most importantly, we have implemented a new sequence device, MinION, which allows full-genome determination on site under rural field conditions.\",\n",
       " 'Viruses within the Flavivirus genus, such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), West Nile (WN), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses, are important human pathogens, typically causing a devastating and often fatal neurological disease. They represent a serious public health problem in many regions of the world. Due to the changes in climate and an increase in human population and travel, both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses expanded their geographic range during the past decades and emerged in areas where they previously did not exist. The spread of viruses in new areas resulted in severe impact on wildlife and caused outbreaks of diseases in humans. Currently, WN is endemic throughout the North America and it is the major source of viral encephalitis in the USA. During the 1999-2014 outbreaks, nearly 3 million people were infected with WN in the US, with about 18,810 reported cases of encephalitis/meningitis that resulted in 1765 deaths, majority of which occurred in elderly. No licensed human vaccine is available to prevent WN disease. Also, despite the use of formalin-inactivated TBEV vaccines, the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis has increased in endemic areas of Europe and Asia during the past 2 decades. This increase in number of flavivirus associated illness emphasizes the need for effective vaccines that will induce a durable immunity and protection. The pathogenesis of neurotropic flavivirus infections involves two distinct properties of the viruses: neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. In the brain, the primary targets of neurotropic flaviviruses are neurons. Thus, successful attenuation of a neurotropic virus depends on the prevention of virus entry into the central nervous system (CNS) and restriction of its replication in the neurons. In order to limit virus access into the CNS, we utilized an approach in which non-neuroinvasive dengue flavivirus (DEN4) was used as a genetic background to create a new antigenic chimeric flavivirus containing structural protein genes derived from a wild-type neurotropic flavivirus (TBEV, JE, SLE, or WN). Chimerization reduced neuroinvasiveness, the ability of virus to replicate in the periphery and spread into the CNS, but viruses retained a high level of neurovirulence in mice and monkeys. In studies performed in our section in FY2013-14, we have proved that an approach based on targeting of the flavivirus genome for number of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) abundantly expressed in the brain is a simple and efficient method to control the replication and pathogenesis of neurotropic flavivirus (chimeric tick-borne encephalitis virus/dengue type 4 virus; TBEV/DEN4) in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. Moreover, we found that simultaneous multiple miRNA co-targeting of two distantly located regions, the 3-noncoding region (3NCR) and the open reading frame (ORF), completely abolished the virus neurotropism as no viral replication was detected in the developing CNS of neonatal mice. Additionally, no viral antigens were detected in neurons, and neuronal integrity in the brain of mice was well preserved. In FY2015, immunogenic properties of these viruses were tested in rhesus monkeys, in which parental TBEV/DEN4 virus caused a high level, long-lasting viremia while  the introduction of miRNA targets in the TBEV/DEN4 genome greatly attenuated the virus for monkeys; their mean peak viremia was reduced by a 50-fold. However, immunization with a single dose of these viruses induced robust TBEV-specific antibody response that was comparable to that of monkeys that received 3 human doses of commercially available inactivated TBEV vaccine. As a result, monkeys immunized with miRNA viruses were completely protected against challenge with neurovirulent TBEV/LGT virus. In 2015, principles of miRNA-targeting to control the virus replication in the CNS were applied to chimeric SLE/DEN4 and WN/DEN4 viruses. We demonstrated that insertion of targets for mir-9 and mir-124 miRNAs in the E protein gene and in three sites in the 3NCR of SLE/DEN4 or WN/DEN4 was sufficient to selectively inhibit viral replication in neurons and to constrain the development of lethal encephalitis in adult and newborn mice after intracerebral or intraperitoneal infection. Currently, evaluation of protective properties of a number of miRNA-targeted SLE/DEN4 and WN/DEN4 viruses in mice are underway. Flaviviruses are transmitted in nature by their specific arthropod vector, and the enviromental safety of live attenuated flavivirus vaccines is a significant concern. Hypothetically, the DEN4-based vaccine viruses (TBEV/DEN4, SLE/DEN4, and WN/DEN4 miRNA-targeted viruses) have a potential for reversion back to wild-type that could be associated with possible dissemination of these mutated viruses by mosquitoes after feeding on vaccinees. To mitigate this risk we developed a microRNA-targeting approach that selectively restricts replication of flavivirus in the mosquito host. Introduction of sequences complementary to a mosquito-specific mir-184 and mir-275 miRNAs individually or in combination into the 3NCR and/or ORF region resulted in selective restriction of DEN4 replication in mosquito cell lines and two species of Aedes mosquitoes, which are the widely distributed competent vectors for many arboviruses. We believe that the developed miRNA co-targeting approach can be adapted to support the design of environmentally safe, live attenuated virus vaccines by restricting their ability to be introduced into nature and limiting the possibility of subsequent viral evolution, leading to unpredictable consequences.In FY2015, we investigated the suitability of the miRNA-targeting approach for attenuation of the more neurovirulent chimeric virus (TBEV/LGT), which is based on the genetic backbone of the naturally attenuated, tick-borne Langat virus (LGT). Since LGT is antigenically closely related to TBEV strains, we assumed that LGT-based chimeric TBEV/LGT vaccines might provide greater humoral and cellular immunity against TBEV than our lead candidate based on the DEN4 genetic backbone. Unlike the TBEV/DEN4, the TBEV/LGT virus retained ability of its parental viruses to spread from peripheral site of inoculation to the CNS. We evaluated ten potential sites in the 3NCR of the TBEV/LGT genome for placement of microRNA targets and found that the TBEV/LGT genome is more restrictive for such genetic manipulations compared to that of TBEV/DEN4. In addition, unlike TBEV/DEN4 virus, the introduction of the multiple miRNA targets into either 3NCR or ORF of TBEV/LGT genome had only modest effect on virus attenuation in the developing CNS of highly permissive newborn mice. However, simultaneous miRNA-targeting in the ORF and 3NCR had more than additive effect on control and silencing of virus replication in the brain and completely abolished the virus neurotropism. Furthermore, neuroinvasiveness of miRNA-targeted TBEV/LGT viruses in very sensitive immunodeficient SCID mice was significantly limited but was not complete. In the absence of potent B and T cell responses prolonged replication of viruses in SCID mice was accompanied by emergence of escape mutants with large deletions of miRNA-targets inserted in both sites of the genome leading to neurological disease. It appears that to provide more effective protection against neuroinvasive TBEV/LGT virus, the copy number of miRNA targets should be increased in many different genome regions. We are currently investigating possibility of the placement of additional miRNA targets in viral genome with the aim of tuning viral replication in the CNS and periphery.',\n",
       " 'Our main vaccine platform is based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSVs), a live-attenuate vaccine approach. Over the years we have generated several rVSVs expressing the glycoproteins (GP) of representative isolates of all species of Ebola virus: Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Tai forest ebolavirus (TFEBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). Additionally, we generated rVSVs expressing the GPs of two isolates of Marburg virus: Lake Victoria marburgvirus isolate Musoke and Angola. All vaccine vectors have been extensively characterized in cell culture and their protective efficacy has been evaluated in animal models (rodents, nonhuman primates) against homologous challenges. In an effort to decipher the mechanism of protection of the rVSV vaccine vectors we used the rVSV/ZEBOVgp as a model. We could demonstrate in nonhuman primates that antibodies specific to the foreign immunogen play a critical role in protection. Recent similar work also confirmed a role of antibodies for the mechanism of protection mediated by the rVSV vaccine vector against MARV. Overall, we postulate that antibodies (total and neutralizing IgG) play a key role for the mechanism of protection for all rVSV-based vaccine candidates.   In response to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine candidate was fast-tracked and shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans. Phase III clinical trials with this vaccine candidate were initiated in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and are still ongoing. To support the clinical trials we have shown that the GMP-produced rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine lot used in West Africa protects against challenge with a recent local isolate, a proof that had been missing at trial start. A recent preliminary report published in Lancet from the human trial in Guinea reports success of the rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine in a ring vaccination approach. This remarkable outcome is supported by another recent study of our group in nonhuman primates looking into the minimum time needed for protection. We could demonstrate complete protection when rVSV/ZEBOVgp was administered at least one week and partial protection when administered as close as three days prior to challenge. Overall, this is a milestone achievement in the development of Ebola countermeasures. Cross-protection among the different Ebola and Marburg virus species is an important consideration, but is thought to be difficult to achieve due to relatively high genetic variability and the general lack of cross-protective antibodies among genera in particular, but also among species within a single genus. In a first attempt to address this issue, we previously used a single-injection protocol with three blended vaccine vectors (rVSV/SEBOVgp, rVSV/ZEBOVgp and rVSV/MARVgp) and demonstrated complete protection against challenge with the three homologous virus species. We have also performed another proof-of-concept study, in which we evaluated cross-protection following immunization with a single vaccine vector (rVSV/ZEBOVgp or rVSV/CIEBOVgp) and demonstrated partial cross-protection against challenge with a heterologous virus species (BEBOV). This demonstrates that monovalent rVSV-based vaccines may be useful against a newly emerging filovirus species; however, heterologous protection across species remains challenging and may depend on enhancing the immune responses either through booster immunizations or through the inclusion of multiple immunogens. Overall, we can conclude that single monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors can provide partial cross-protection in cases of challenge virus species that are genetically more closely related. As mentioned above, one approach to overcome this limitation is the use of blended monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors, which provide broader protection against homologous and partial protection against certain heterologous challenges. Another approach to overcome the limitations in cross-protection is the use of multivalent rVSV vaccine vectors. In a proof-of-concept study in rodent models protection against ZEBOV and Andes virus (ANDV) or ZEBOV and influenza virus (H5N1) challenge was demonstrated using a single rVSV vector expressing both the ZEBOVgp and the ANDV glycoprotein or ZEBOVgp and a H5 hemagglutinin, respectively. This data showed that the use of bivalent rVSV vectors are a feasible approach to vaccination against multiple pathogens.  Based on the results described above, we have in the past fiscal year successfully generated additional bivalent and trivalent rVSV vectors expressing two or three different filovirus GPs, one as a transmembrane protein (replacing the VSV glycoprotein) and one or two as soluble glycoproteins that will be secreted during vector replication. Recovery of these recombinant vaccine viruses turned out to be difficult but could finally be achieved. In vitro characterization of these vectors, including viral growth curves and verification of foreign immunogen expression, has recently been completed. Efficacy testing in the Ebola and Marburg hamster models of some of these multivalent vectors is ongoing with promising preliminary results. The most promising vaccine vectors will be moved into efficacy testing in the nonhuman primate model for filovirus infections.',\n",
       " 'In 2010, we published the first description of a genetically unique strain of Lassa virus isolated from Mastomys natalensis captured in Mali, an area previously thought to be free of Lassa virus (Safronetz et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2010). Over the last five years we have continued to conduct field studies mapping the geographic distribution of Lassa virus in peridomestic settings across sub-Saharan Mali (Sogoba, Feldmann, Safronetz, Zoonoses Pub Health 2012; Safronetz et al., PLoS Negl Trop Med 2013). With a better understanding of the regions endemic for this virus in Mali, the Lassa program has transitioned into studies aimed at defining the infection dynamics and transmissibility of Lassa in the natural rodent hosts. For this we have established a colony of Mastomys natalensis at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. A proof-of-concept study showed that the animals can be persistently infected with Lassa without showing obvious clinical signs but virus shedding through different routes (Rosenke et al., unpublished data). Thus, this colony provides a unique tool for future studies Lassa virus infection in the natural host. We also have started to define the incidence rates of Lassa virus infection in humans in Southern Mali. A first human serosurvey study was conducted at three sites and data are currently being analyzed.  Seroprevalence was found at all sites ranging from 16-44% (Safronetz et al., unpublished data). As there are no reports of Lassa fever, the disease caused by Lassa virus infection, this indicates that asymptomatic and mild infections are frequently occurring. Future studies at different sites need to confirm this preliminary results. Diagnostic testing has been implemented to identify human infections in future to determine the public health importance of Lassa virus infections.  As mentioned above, we do have a Lassa virus isolate from Mali (designated Soromba) (Safronetz et al., Emerg Infect Dis 2010). Multiple studies have been performed at Rocky Mountain Laboratories defining the pathogenic potential in animal models as well as the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals. Lassa-Soromba seems to be less virulent in animal models and presents with an atypical clinical disease in the cynomolgus macaque model (Safronetz et al., J Infect dis 2013) supporting the idea of the circulation of a distinct and less pathogenic Lassa strain in Southern Mali. A live-attenuated recombinant vaccine platform expressing the Lassa virus glycoproteins was cross-protective against several Lassa isolates including Lassa-Soromba (Garbutt et al., J Virol 2004; Geisbert et al., PLoS Med 2005; Marzi et al., Emerg Infect Dis 2015; Safronetz et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2015). Ribavirin and favipiravir are effective as antivirals even when given post onset of symptoms with favipiravir being superior over ribavirin (Safronetz et al., unpublished data). The Mali field program has expanded to include other zoonotic viruses including surveillance for additional arenaviruses, hantaviruses, MERS-CoV, and CCHFV, as well as rodent-specific pathogens including cytomegalovirus (Zivcec et al., Emerg Infect Dis 2013). In the future we will include testing serum/blood from humans and livestock and wildlife species to determine the prevalence and importance of zoonotic pathogens for animal and public health in Mali. This program also includes education and training of young Malian scientists.References: 1: Safronetz D, et al.

       " \"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the world, causing serious complications on women's reproductive health including ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. C. trachomatis also causes infection of the eye resulting in inflammation and in some cases blindness.  The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics, and pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infections in different population settings, including populations in resource constrained countries. We have used the Internet, www.iwantthekit.org, since 2004 to offer sampling in Maryland and other areas in the U.S. for chlamydia screening in over 6,400 women and over 3400 men using self-obtained vaginal swabs, penile-meatal swabs, and rectal samples. Samples are also tested for gonorrhea and trichomonas. Prevalence for chlamydia for women since 2004 is 7.2%, and for this year 5.9%. However the prevalence for chlamydia this year is 19.0% in young women age 15-19 yr. Both young age and Black race were statistically associated with chlamydia positivity. For men, the overall chlamydia prevalence has been 8.2%; for this year the prevalence is 6.8%. Acceptance for self-collecting penile and rectal swabs has been very high. Rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence this year for males in Maryland is 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively.  Whereas for females in Maryland, rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence is 9.8% and 0%, respectively. To study the capability for performing a point-of-care self-test for trichomonas at home, we enrolled 92 women who performed the mailed test successfully at home, demonstrating high accuracy, high acceptability and trust in their result.Trachoma due to C. trachomatis infection is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. The WHO has recommended that three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics be offered to control the disease in districts where the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is >10% in children aged 1-9 years, with treatment coverage of at least 80%. We have conducted both surgical and antibiotic treatment intervention studies in Gambia, Niger, and Tanzania in efforts to control trachoma. To evaluate a point of care molecular diagnostic for field use we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and field utility of the Cepheid GeneXpert C. trachomatis assay for ocular chlamydia infection compared to Roche Amplicor assay. In a trachoma-endemic community in Kongwa, Tanzania, 144 children ages 0 to 9 were surveyed to assess clinical trachoma and had two ocular swabs taken. Of the 144 swabs taken the prevalence of follicular trachoma by clinical exam was 43.7%, and by evidence of infection according to Amplicor was 28.5%. The sensitivity of GeneXpert for C. trachomatis when compared to Amplicor was 100% and the GeneXpert test identified more positives in individuals with clinical trachoma than Amplicor. The GeneXpert test for C. trachomatis performed with high sensitivity and specificity and demonstrated excellent promise as a field test for trachoma control. Poling samples before testing has been demonstrated to be a cost effective method when prevalence in low. Positive pools can then be tested individually to determine the individual positive. When pools are negative all the samples in the pool are considered to be negative. This method will help with the cost of the trachoma elimination program.To determine whether infection recurs after mass treatment, we re-examined individuals in Tanzania five years after initiation of the MDA program. Treatment coverage was 80% for all ages in the first year. At five years, clinical trachoma rates were lower than at baseline, dropping to less than 45% compared to 81% at baseline. The prevalence of trachoma decreased in a linear fashion with number of years of mass treatment, and decreased prevalence of C. trachomatis infection was related to the extent of the previous years azithromycin coverage. In districts prioritized for three MDA rounds with very low baseline levels of trachoma, one round of MDA reduced active trachoma to low levels and chlamydia infection was not detectable in any community. There was no additional benefit to giving two further rounds of MDA. Programs could save scarce resources by determining when to initiate or to discontinue MDA based on testing for Ct infection, and one round of MDA may be all that is necessary in some settings to reduce TF below the elimination threshold.  The source of infection following mass treatment is unknown. If migrants into a village undergoing MDA are shown to impede progress towards elimination, then a local strategy that addresses treatment of new families and a nationwide strategy that addresses migration will be needed. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of migrants on the prevalence of infection and clinical trachoma in communities.  In four communities in Kongwa, Tanzania, all children were enrolled in a longitudinal study of infection and trachoma. New children were identified at census updates as having not been in the community at the previous census. Within communities, neighborhoods were defined as spatially close groups of households. All children in the communities were invited to be examined for trachoma, and have ocular swabs taken for evidence of infection. Trachoma was graded using the WHO simplified grading scheme, and swabs were processed using Amplicor. Children who were migrants were more likely to be infected and to have trachoma than children who were resident in the community, which was significant by the time of the survey following the third year of MDA (odds ratio, OR, 2.49, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.036.05). The neighborhoods where newcomers resided were more likely to have infection a year later than neighborhoods with no migrants, which was most pronounced following the third year of MDA (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.077.65). In summary, migrants to communities may be an important source of re-emergent infection, especially as MDA lowers infection among residents. Highly migrant populations may need a special surveillance and treatment program to avoid slowing progress in communities under MDA.\",\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 50 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and caused up to 18,000 deaths in the U.S. and up to 575,000 deaths globally. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Efforts to identify pre-1918 influenza virus RNA-positive autopsy material are continuing. Possible fatal influenza pneumonia cases from 1907-1917 have been identified in tissue archives and anonymized materials are being screened for host and viral RNA by RT-PCR. In a related effort, a method has been developed allowing high-throughput deep sequencing of host, viral, and bacterial RNA from archival tissue samples.  This method significantly reduces ribosomal RNA allowing sequence analysis of viral and host mRNA expression and identification of secondary bacterial infections. Lastly, two epidemiological studies were undertaken to characterize the U.S. military camp experiences with the 1918 influenza pandemic and to compare that to the 1917 measles epidemics.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually.  Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses continue to circulate enzootically in poultry in many countries and continue to cause human infections. Recently a novel avian H7N9 strain emerged in China also causing human infections and fatalities. A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to model host adaptation, map viral virulence factors and host factors in disease progression, evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines were performed.Understanding the origin, virulence, and pathogenic properties of the 1918 virus, is crucial for current public health preparedness and future pandemic planning. The origin of the 1918 pandemic virus has not been resolved, but its coding sequences are very like those of avian influenza virus.  Recent work with 1918:low pathogenicity avian influenza H1N1 chimeric viruses suggested that the virulence factor(s) in the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) gene might be shared with low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses expressing H1 HAs. Zoonotic avian influenza virus infections may lead to epidemics or pandemics. The 1918 pandemic influenza virus has an avian influenza virus-like genome, and its H1 hemagglutinin was identified as a key mammalian virulence factor. A chimeric 1918 virus expressing a contemporary avian H1 hemagglutinin, however, displayed murine pathogenicity indistinguishable from that of the 1918 virus. Here, isogenic chimeric avian influenza viruses were constructed on an avian influenza virus backbone, differing only by hemagglutinin subtype expressed. Viruses expressing the avian H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 subtypes were pathogenic in mice and cytopathic in normal human bronchial epithelial cells, in contrast to H2-, H3-, H5-, H9-, H11-, H13-, H14-, and H16-expressing viruses. Mouse pathogenicity was associated with pulmonary macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. These data suggest that avian influenza virus hemagglutinins H1, H6, H7, H10, and H15 contain inherent mammalian virulence factors and likely share a key virulence property of the 1918 virus. Consequently, zoonotic infections with avian influenza viruses bearing one of these hemagglutinins may cause enhanced disease in mammals.Pneumonia due to viral and bacterial infections is a leading cause of death in children and adults worldwide. Severe influenza and bacterial co-infection induce hypoxic respiratory failure, manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pre-clinical studies of pneumonia in animals that evaluate pathogenesis and treatment do not capture the evolution of oxygen gas exchange abnormalities that can be correlated with the development and resolution of lung injury in humans. To address this a model of infection-induced lung injury in Rhesus Macaques was developed and it was demonstrated that oxygen gas exchange abnormalities correlated with radiologic, immunologic, and pathologic markers of disease. Animals were infected with influenza A virus via intratracheal or small-particle aerosol inoculation, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus via intratracheal inoculation, or connected with influenza (intra-tracheal or aerosol) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus combined. We observed that intratracheal delivered influenza A virus alone or in combination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus induced acute lung injury. Oxygen gas exchange abnormalities correlated well with radiologic and pathologic abnormalities as well as cellular immune responses in lung-lining fluid. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus alone and aerosol influenza infection in combination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus induced pneumonia without significant oxygen gas exchange abnormalities. This model provides a new tool for correlating impaired oxygenation with radiologic and biologic markers of disease to advance understanding and treatment of severe pneumonia. Influenza virus infections are a global public health problem, with a significant impact of morbidity and mortality from both annual epidemics and pandemics. The current strategy for preventing annual influenza is to develop a new vaccine each year against specific circulating virus strains. Because these vaccines are unlikely to protect against an antigenically divergent strain or a new pandemic virus with a novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtype, there is a critical need for vaccines that protect against all influenza A viruses, a so-called  universal  vaccine. Here we show that mice were broadly protected against challenge with a wide variety of lethal influenza A virus infections (94% aggregate survival following vaccination) with a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine cocktail. The vaccine consisted of a mixture of VLPs individually displaying H1, H3, H5, or H7 HAs, and vaccinated mice showed significant protection following challenge with influenza viruses expressing 1918 H1, 1957 H2, and avian H5, H6, H7, H10, and H11 hemagglutinin subtypes. These experiments suggest a promising and practical strategy for developing a broadly protective  universal  influenza vaccine.',\n",
       " 'Nonhuman primate (NHP) models present the opportunity to test a variety of candidate AIDS vaccines, optimizing their ability to elicit immune responses and testing their ability to prevent infection or to control virus replication after virus challenge. NHP models can be used to optimize vaccines, to evaluate vaccine combinations, to determine vaccine delivery routes that provide immune responses at mucosal portals of entry, to find ways to generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, and, following challenge with virus, to determine whether or not the vaccine immunizations were effective. NHP models can also be used to explore a vaccine�s impact on the risk of acquisition of infection. NIAID supports NHP studies through both contract (Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contracts) and grant assistance mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'The primary goal is to perform pediatric clinical studies to identify a live attenuated vaccine against RSV. We also have performed or are performing clinical studies for HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3, and HMPV candidates. In the future, studies with the HPIVs will be restricted to strains that also express RSV antigen as bivalent vaccines. All vaccine viruses are developed and produced from cloned cDNAs using reverse genetic systems of our making and employ defined attenuating mutations of our making. We develop candidates in pre-clinical studies and prepare vaccine seeds. Vaccine manufacture is performed under contact under our supervision, and clinical evaluation is performed by contract or collaboration under our supervision. Vaccines are evaluated clinically beginning in adults (who are seropositive for these common viruses), and moving successively to seropositive older children (typically 12-59 months of age) followed by seronegative younger children and infants (typically 6 -24 months of age for RSV, 6-59 months of age for the others). For RSV and HPIV3, viruses may be evaluated further in virus-naive young infants 1-3 months of age. Adult studies are open-label, whereas pediatric studies are double-blind placebo-controlled with a 2:1 ratio of vaccine to placebo recipients. For all RSV studies, subjects are followed during the subsequent RSV season (Nov 01 to March 31) following the experimental immunization in order to assess the longevity of the antibody response and the rate and severity of natural RSV infection (although these studies are too small to reliably assess protective efficacy), and to confirm the absence of enhanced RSV disease. RSV vaccine: We previously made an RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delM2-2 that is based on deletion of most of the ORF encoding the M2-2 protein. This mutation down-regulated viral RNA replication and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. In addition, deletion of an ORF should be refractory to reversion or compensation, providing increased genetic and phenotypic stability. We performed a phase 1 clinical study (NCT01459198) of a version of this mutant whose seed virus was supplied by MedImmune and is called RSV MEDI delM2-2. In seronegative children, and compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the delM2-2- virus was significantly more restricted for shedding in nasal washes but induced significantly higher titers of RSV neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. In this particular trial, there was an unusually high incidence of adventitious infections by other respiratory viruses in both the vaccine and the placebo groups, which confounded evaluation of tolerability. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season showed that several RSV MEDI&#8710;M2-2 recipients had substantial antibody rises without reported illness, suggesting that the vaccine was protective yet primed for anamnestic responses to RSV. Rational design appears to have yielded a candidate RSV vaccine that is intrinsically superior at eliciting protective antibodies in RSV-nave children, and highlights a new approach for the development of live-attenuated RSV vaccines. We presently are conducting a second phase 1 study in 51 additional seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT02040831). This study involves a version of the delM2-2 virus that was derived in our laboratory and is called RSV LID delM2-2. Part of this study is being done in collaboration with the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group.The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive, but exhibits genetic instability involving at least two attenuating mutations. We previously developed a new version of this virus, called cps2, in which these two mutations have been modified for increased genetic stability. RSV cps2 is presently in a phase 1 study in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266). This study involves 51 subjects, and part of this study is being done with IMPAACT.We also previously developed another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein-2 (NS2) gene, which encodes a protein that antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 study in 30 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01893554). Thus, we have three promising RSV platforms in phase 1 studies: RSV delM2-2, RSV cps2, and RSV delNS2del1313. These viruses have different properties (such as temperature-sensitivity and differences in antigen expression) and different mechanisms of attenuation (involving effects on RNA synthesis, regulation of RNA synthesis, IFN antagonism, among others). Our goal is to expeditiously identify a suitable live attenuated RSV candidate to bring forward into larger studies. The RSV delM2-2 virus appears to be particularly promising. Wild type (WT) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of WT RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. This virus will be evaluated for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in adult volunteers. This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate antiviral drug candidates and vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response. HPIV3 vaccine: We previously developed and evaluated an attenuated version of HPIV3 called rHPIV3 cp45. This is a recombinant version of a biologically derived cold-passaged (cp) virus that we previously showed has satisfactory infectivity, safety, immunogenicity, and lack of transmissibility in seronegative infants and children in phase 1 and 2 studies. LID re-derived this virus from cDNA to provide a known pedigree for safety reasons. This virus was indistinguishable from its biological parent in a phase 1 study in seronegative infants and children, and thus is available to take to larger studies and combine with an RSV candidate when the optimal candidate is identified. We previously evaluated a combination of HPIV3 cp45 plus an attenuated RSV strain in a phase 1 study in seronegative children and showed that the two viruses were compatible, and that the bivalent vaccine was well-tolerated and immunogenic. A second HPIV3 vaccine based on bovine PIV3 in which the F and HN genes were replaced with their counterparts from HPIV3 also has been evaluated in seronegative infants and children and was attenuated, well-tolerated, and immunogenic.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. A phase 1 study in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics. HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 study in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437). HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. This virus is presently being evaluated in a phase 1 study in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410).',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and are the cause of yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile fever syndromes.  In recent years, much of our laboratory effort was focused on the development and preclinical testing of dengue virus vaccine candidates suitable for inclusion in a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.  Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials, and several tetravalent vaccine admixtures have also recently been evaluated in human subjects.  An optimal tetravalent admixture (TV005) has been selected and has now entered Phase II evaluation.  Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of important functions, including, 1) manufacture, maintenance, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations,  3) support of the five companies/foundations that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes,  preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, assistance with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data, 4) support of collaborations with investigators interested in basic virology or immunology studies, 5) use of immune cells collected from our clinical studies to investigate the innate immune response to vaccination, and 6) preclinical development of potential second-generation vaccine candidates, such as the flavivirus pentavalent vaccine designed for control of dengue and Japanese encephalitis.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the AsiaPacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually.  The high fatality rate and frequent residual neuro-psychiatric sequelae in survivors make JEV infection a considerable health problem. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory.  It is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation pentavalent vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia.  Toward this end, a fully virulent JEV isolate (India/78) was selected as the parent virus for vaccine development based on the pathogenicity of a number of wildtype JEV isolates tested in mice by intracerebral or peripheral inoculation.   Genome sequencing of this virus provided the template for creating full-length recombinant cDNA clones of JEV and chimeric cDNA clones containing the JEV structural genes and the DEN4 nonstructural genes.  The laboratory has recovered these engineered viruses and has evaluated their pathogenicity in mice.  The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and thus provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations.  The rJEV/DEN4 chimeric viruses appear to be over-attenuated in mice, indicating that chimerization is much more attenuating for JEV compared to the related West Nile virus.  Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes.  Following evaluation in mice, a number of these recombinant viruses look suitable for consideration as vaccine candidates.',\n",
       " 'Ferrets are widely used for influenza virus pathogenesis, virus transmission, and antiviral therapy studies. However, the contributions of the volume of inoculum administered and the ferrets respiratory tract anatomy to disease outcome have not been explored. We noted variations in clinical disease outcomes and the volume of inoculum administered and investigated these differences by administering two influenza viruses (A/California/07/2009 H1N1 pandemic and A/Minnesota/11/2010H3N2 variant) to ferrets intranasally at a dose of 106 50% tissue culture infective doses in a range of inoculum volumes (0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 ml) and followed viral replication, clinical disease, and pathology over 6 days. Clinical illness and respiratory tract pathology were the most severe and most consistent when the viruses were administered in a volume of 1.0 ml. Using a modified micro-computed tomography imaging method and examining gross specimens, we found that the right main-stem bronchus was consistently larger in diameter than the left main-stem bronchus, though the latter was longer and straighter. These anatomic features likely influence the distribution of the inoculum in the lower respiratory tract. A 1.0-ml volume of inoculum is optimal for delivery of virus to the lower respiratory tract of ferrets, particularly when evaluation of clinical disease is desired. Furthermore, we identified important anatomical features of the ferret lung that influence the kinetics of viral replication, clinical disease severity, and lung pathology.LID scientists are collaborating with scientists from MedImmune under a CRADA to generate candidate vaccines against avian influenza viruses of each subtype. The vaccines were generated using plasmid based reverse genetics and each contains the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes from an avian influenza virus and six internal gene segments from the AA ca virus. H2 influenza viruses have not circulated in humans since 1968 and therefore a significant portion of the population would be susceptible to infection should H2 influenza viruses re-emerge. Therefore the development of an H2N2 vaccine is a priority in pandemic preparedness planning. We previously showed that a single dose of a cold-adapted (ca) H2N2 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) based on the influenza A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA ca) virus was immunogenic and efficacious in mice and ferrets. However, in a Phase I clinical trial, viral replication was restricted and immunogenicity was poor. We compared the replication of four H2N2 LAIV candidate viruses, AA ca, A/Tecumseh/3/67 (TEC67ca), and two variants of A/Japan/305/57 (JAP57 ca) in three non-human primate (NHP) species: African green monkeys (AGM), cynomolgus macaques (CM) and rhesus macaques (RM). One JAP57 ca virus variant had glutamine and glycine at HA amino acid positions 226 and 228 (QG) that binds to alpha 2-3 linked sialic acids, and one had leucine and serine that binds to alpha 2-3 and  alpha 2-6 linked residues (LS). The replication of all ca viruses was restricted, with low titers detected in the upper respiratory tract of all NHP species, however replication was detected in significantly more CMs than AGMs. The JAP57 ca QG and TEC67ca viruses replicated in a significantly higher percentage of NHPs than the AA ca virus, with the TEC67ca virus recovered from the greatest percentage of animals. Altering the receptor specificity of the JAP57ca virus from alpha 2-3 to both alpha 2-3 and  alpha 2-6 linked sialic acid residues did not significantly increase the number of animals infected or the titer to which the virus replicated. Taken together, our data show that in NHPs the AA ca virus more closely reflects the human experience than mice or ferret studies. CMs and RMs may be the preferred species for evaluating H2N2 LAIV viruses, and the TEC67ca virus may be the most promising H2N2 LAIV candidate for further evaluation.Since it is difficult to predict which influenza virus subtype will cause an influenza pandemic, it is important to prepare influenza virus vaccines against different subtypes and evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines in preclinical andclinical studies prior to a pandemic. In addition to infecting humans, H3 influenza viruses commonly infect pigs, horses, and avian species. Equine influenza viruses (EIV) are responsible for rapidly spreading outbreaks of respiratory disease in horses. Although natural infections of humans with EIV have not been reported, experimental inoculation of humans with these viruses can lead to a productive infection and elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, EIV have crossed the species barrier to infect dogs, pigs,and camels and therefore may also pose a threat to humans. Based on serologic cross-reactivity of H3N8 EIV from different lineages, A/equine/Georgia/1/1981 (eq/GA/81) was selected to produce a live attenuated candidate vaccine by reverse genetics with the HA and NA genes of the eq/GA/81 wild-type virus and the six internal protein genes of the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) vaccine donor virus. In both mice and ferrets, intranasal administration of a single dose of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine virus induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred complete protection from homologous wt virus challenge in the upper respiratory tract. One dose of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine also induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred complete protection in mice and nearly complete protection in ferrets upon heterologous challenge with the H3N8 (eq/Newmarket/03) virus. These data support further evaluation of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine in humans for use in the event of transmission of an equine H3N8 influenza virus to humans.H3N8 influenza viruses are also commonly found in wild birds, usually causing mild or no disease in infected birds. However, they have crossed the species barrier and have been associated with outbreaks in dogs, pigs, donkeys, and seals and therefore pose a threat to humans. A live attenuated, cold-adapted (ca) H3N8 vaccine virus was generated by reverse genetics using the HA and NA genes from the A/blue-winged teal/Texas/Sg-00079/2007 (H3N8) (tl/TX/079/07) virus and the six internal protein gene segments from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 ca (H2N2) vaccine donor strain. One dose of the tl/TX/079/07 ca vaccine induced a robust neutralizing antibody response against the homologous (tl/TX/079/07) and two heterologous influenza viruses, including the recently emerged A/harbor seal/New Hampshire/179629/2011 (H3N8) and A/northern pintail/Alaska/44228-129/2006 (H3N8) viruses, and conferred robust protection against the homologous and heterologous influenza viruses. We also analyzed human sera against the tl/TX/079/07 H3N8 avian influenza virus and observed low but detectable antibody reactivity in elderly subjects, suggesting that older H3N2 influenza viruses confer some cross-reactive antibody. The latter observation was confirmed in a ferret study. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the tl/TX/079/07 ca vaccine in mice and ferrets support further evaluation of this vaccine in humans for use in the event of transmission of an H3N8 avian influenza virus to humans. The human and ferret serology data suggest that a single dose of the vaccine may be sufficient in older subjects.',\n",
       " 'Collaborations with Sanaria Inc and the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Bamako, Mali to conduct these PfSPZ related studies was initiated in 2012.PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali (NIAID Protocol 14-I-N010)Since January 2013, we have been preparing for a study to test the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against naturally occurring malaria infection of PfSPZ Vaccine in Malian adults. The phase 1 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of repeated IV immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali started in January 2014 in Doneguebougou, Mali at the Malaria Research and Training Center with complete enrollment into the study by February 2014.  Twelve subjects were initially enrolled in a staggered manner for safety in the pilot safety group and received their first vaccination (1.35x105 PfSPZ Vaccine) the week of 28 January 2014, and then received 2.7x105 PfSPZ Vaccine two weeks later.   97 subjects were initially enrolled of which 96 subjects were stratified by village and randomized for the main group.  Of those 96 subjects, 93 subjects (46 PfSPZ Vaccine; 47 placebo) received their first vaccination starting the week of 24 February 2014.  The final vaccinations were received by 88 subjects (44 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 placebo) the week of 14 July 2014.  The primary efficacy endpoint of the study started the week of 11 August 2014 (28 days following receipt of the fifth vaccination) and the final study visit was completed on 05 January 2014.  Of the 88 subjects in the main group who received all five vaccinations, 86 subjects (42 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 placebo) completed the study through the transmission season to the last study visit88 healthy malaria exposed Malian adults (44 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 Placebo) received five doses of vaccine and 86 (42 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 Placebo) were followed actively every two weeks for up to 24 weeks post vaccination #5. PfSPZ Vaccine was easy to administer, and was safe and well tolerated. P. falciparum infections 28 days post vaccination 5 occurred significantly earlier in the control group than the PfSPZ Vaccine group. PfSPZ Vaccine is safe, well tolerated, and is the first vaccine to show evidence of sterile protection to African adults from natural P. falciparum infection over the course of an entire malaria season.PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali V2 (NIAID Protocol TBD)Our initial results from Protocol 14-I-N010 have been encouraging given the following: 1) the protective efficacy was significantly higher than has ever been demonstrated by immunization with a malaria vaccine in adult Africans, 2) the PfSPZ Vaccine was efficacious against heterogeneous African P. falciparum parasites and 3) there was no evidence of waning of immunity during the 6 month follow up period. In addition, all doses were safe and well tolerated with little reactogenicity or adverse events reported. On the other hand, protection in both Tanzania and efficacy in Mali were lower than what was recorded in the USA, and it does not meet our expectations for a licensed PfSPZ Vaccine. One possible explanation for the lower rates of efficacy was provided by our assessment of antibody responses seen in Mali and Tanzania as noted above. These results clearly demonstrate that healthy Tanzanian and Malian adults do not produce comparable antibody responses to PfCSP after immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine to the non-Pf malaria-exposed adults in the U.S. Because adults play a significant role in transmission of P falciparum, and if PfSPZ Vaccine is to be used as a tool for elimination, it must be protective in adults. We think that the most likely explanation for the poor immunogenicity and protection in the adult Africans is immunoregulation due to lifelong exposure to P falciparum infections. Thus, we hypothesize that we can improve efficacy by increasing the number of PfSPZ Vaccine per dose, increasing the interval between the first and second doses to 8 weeks (as was done in WRAIR 2080 in the group receiving 3 doses of 4.5x105 PfSPZ), and reducing the number of doses to three. Additionally, we hypothesize that we can learn how the standard CHMI model may be used in the field and start to explore the impact such factors as malaria co-infection and drug treatment have on vaccine responses. A protocol, with a defined dose escalation pilot study followed by a double blind, randomized placebo-controlled main study was drafted and has completed NIAID IRB submission and review.  The protocol is planned to be implemented in Doneguebougou, Mali in November 2015 through January 2016.  PfSPZ CVac-PYR  (NIAID Protocol 15-I-0169)As previously noted, a human study suggested that anti-infection immunity might be achieved with a much smaller parasite inoculum. This method of immunization by experimental P. falciparum infection in conjunction with antimalarial prophylaxis is referred to as chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS), infection treatment vaccine (ITV), and chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CVac) by different authors. We use the term CVac in this Protocol to refer to this vaccine concept.Since chloroquine is a blood-stage schizonticide, the degree to which the protective immune response induced by the chloroquine CVac model targets liver or blood-stage antigens is unclear from the study of Roestenberg et al. Further, limited data in both animal and humans indicate that exposure to blood-stage parasites may abrogate liver-stage immune responses. It is important to further define whether sterile protective immunity to P. falciparum can be induced by wild-type (non-attenuated) sporozoite immunizations when exposure is limited to sporozoite and pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle and by a low dose of sporozoite inoculum. This study will evaluate a CVac regimen using chloroquine weekly in addition to pyrimethamine.  This combination will attempt to prevent the development asexual erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite.By completely preventing the release of blood-stage parasites, this CVac regimen will extend the findings of Roestenberg et al. and explore whether highly protective anti-infection immunity and sterile protection from homologous P. falciparum challenge can be induced by exposure that is limited to the liver-stage of parasite development. Exploration of stage-specific immune responses involved in protective immunity to P. falciparum and discovery of new target antigens is critical for future development of malaria vaccine strategies.The intervention in this study is induction of stage specific immunity (pre-erythrocytic immunity) to malaria following direct venous inoculation (DVI) with aseptic, purified, vialed, cryopreserved, fully infectious NF54 PfSPZ (referred to as Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge) produced by Sanaria, Inc when exposure is limited to the SPZ and liver-stages of the parasite life cycle and at a low dose PfSPZ inoculum (51,200 Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge) via the following regimens: PfSPZ Challenge under chloroquine coverage or PfSPZ Challenge under chloroquine and pyrimethamine coverage for a total of 3 exposures while subjects are under one or two malaria prophylaxis regimens listed above.  Protective efficacy will be assessed by homologous CHMI via PfSPZ Challenge via DVI. This study has been supported by the U01 grant mechanism (RPPR-5U01AI109700-02) and the study has been NIAID IRB approved to start in 2015.  Current plans are for the clinical study to start in November 2015.',\n",
       " 'The Vector borne viruses from different virus families account for many medically significant viral pathogens. More specifically, the vector borne flaviviruses, which belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, comprise some of the most important emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are generally transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. The mosquito borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Our current research is focused on the TBFV, but studying the biology of TBFV will elucidate the biology of other vector borne viruses. The research in our laboratory employs virology, immunology, advanced imaging techniques, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology, and vector biology. We primarily study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. In addition, in the past year we have initiated lab and animal studies using the more virulent autochthonous BSL-3 POWV/DTV. Comparison of TBFV biology in mammalian and tick cells. A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. We previously published a study comparing LGTV virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum. Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems. In contrast to mammalian cells, TBFV-infection in tick cells shows delayed and decreased membrane proliferation. Additionally, electron tomography of infected tick cells shows a shift from spherical vesicles to tubular profiles, especially in the context of persistently infected cells. In 2015, we continued these structural studies to cultures of primary embryonic brain. LGTV infection was largely restricted to cells of neuronal origin, and ultrastructural studies revealed results similar to those observed in mammalian cell lines, although the frequency of the tubular profiles appeared greater than in permanent cell lines. Cellular structures associated with viral replication and virions were observed all along the processes of neurons, suggesting that these components are transported to actual nerve endings. The viral proteins and cellular partners responsible for the membrane rearrangements are a topic of interest in BVBV. Therefore, we have developed molecular clones expressing the nonstructural proteins, either singly or in clusters, that should prove suitable for evaluating the role of specific proteins in the rearrangement of the cellular membranes. It is hoped that the vector backbones should allow for good expression in both mammalian and tick cell lines. We have determined that expression in mammalian cells is higher using vectors with the chicken beta-actin promoter, and that Effectene is most efficacious transfetin reagent. Initial results implicate that NS4a in the ER expansion and membrane rearrangement associated with TBFV infection.Molecular biology and molecular pathogenesis of acute and persistent TBFV infection. Persistent infection plays a crucial role in natural life cycle of TBFV in rodent and arthropod hosts, and may also be responsible for prolonged debilitating sequelae observed in survivors of acute TBFV infection. However, this aspect of TBFV biology has been little studied. Published a model of initiation and maintenance of persistent infection of 293T cells with LGTV derived from a full-length molecular clone. Infection resulted in an acute lytic crisis, in which >90% cell death was observed by day 5. However, the sparse cells surviving the lytic crisis repopulate the culture, which can be serially passaged for longer than 30 weeks. Throughout this time, greater than 90% of the cells are positive for LGTV E protein and the cultures produce infectious virus. Although the persistently infected 293T cell cultures produced virus throughout the period, the titer declined with continued passage from near 108 ffu/ml, to approximately 104 ffu/ml. Interestingly, the copy numbers of (+) and (-) viral RNA strands did not change, suggesting a dramatically increasing particle:PFU ratio, consistent with the presence of defective interfering (DI) particles. By intensively investigating these findings with segmental RT-PCR and a deep sequencing strategy we determined that DI particles are not present at the initiation of persistence, but that once persistence is maintained, approximately 35% of the viral genomes contain a specific in-frame deletion affecting E and NS1. The deleted genomes code for a hybrid protein comprised of the N-terminal portion of E and the C-terminal portion of NS1, a moiety never previously reported nor predicted.  DI particles have been previously identified in persistent flavivirus infections, but ours is the first to demonstrate that DI particles do not play a role in the initiation of persistence. A role for DI particles, and the hybrid protein, in the maintenance of persistence is under study.We have also studied changes in the cellular transcriptome, during acute and persistent infection. As noted, LGTV infection causes an acute lytic crisis of most cells, and we have shown the mechanism of cell death is apoptosis. The surviving cells somehow evade apoptosis and go on to establish persistent infection. Thus, the apoptosis pathway is implicated and our agnostic deep sequencing approach confirms that gene pathways associated with cell survival and apoptosis avoidance are involved. Intensive bioinformatics perusal is underway using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and other similar software packages, and this work is being prepared for publication.Peromyscus leucopus is the identified reservoir species for that autochthonous pathogenic POWV. We have begun experiments to characterize POWV/DTV infection in the P. leucopus mice. An intraperitoneal dose of POWV that is lethal to age-matched Balb/C or C57Bl, does not produce a detectable response in P. leucopus. However, when the same dose is administered intra-cerebrally, the P. leucopus mice develop an asymptomatic infection restricted to the brain and characterized by low levels of virus and viral RNA in the brain, as well as neutralizing antibody. A mild meningoencephalitis is evident by 15 days after infection, but resolves. Virus can also be identified by in situ hybridization. Thus, the natural rodent reservoir host for POWV is somehow able to restrict and control the infection. This has interesting implications for the role of the mouse in the POWV biological cycle.',\n",
       " 'Summary: 1.Orthopoxvirus pathogenesisA goal of EVPS is to understand virus-host interactions and exploit them for countermeasure development. Previously we had focused on nonhuman primate model development, these experiments are completed and have been published or are pending.  Our continuing orthopoxvirus work involves Backwards Matched Longitudinal Analysis which identified several cytokines that were statistically associated with lethal or non-lethal outcome in NHPs. The duration and intensity of certain cytokines was associated with survival (IFN-gamma and RANTES) or non-survival (MCP-1). The role of these cytokines was investigated using recombinant virus expressing each cytokine and knockout mice of the cytokine or its receptor. MCP-1 expressing virus and MCP-1 and MCP-1 receptor knockout mice had increased pathogenicity when compared to wild type virus. The MCP-1data suggests that macrophages are essential for controlling infection, but excessive MCP-1 alter macrophage function which may exacerbate disease. IFN-gamma expressing virus did not develop disease, and knockout of IFN-gamma or its receptor resulted in increased pathogenicity. Mice inoculated with interferon gamma expressing virus did not develop any signs of disease and survived lethal challenge at the equivalent 100% lethal dose of wild type virus. Expression of interferon gamma at the site of infection via the recombinant virus resulted in protection from challenge with the LD100 of wild type virus.  2. Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and Ebola virusWe have been developing a rabies virus based vaccine that expresses the glycoprotein (GP) from ebolavirus, marburgvirus and sudanvirus.  Previously we developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University. Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing ZEBOV GP induced cellular and humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. We evaluated our vaccine candidates in a rhesus macaque challenge model. 100% protection was observed with live attenuated RABV-GP. The inactivated and RVdelG-GP viruses provided 50% protection.  Strong humoral and cellular immunity was observed. In summary, our findings indicated that RV-GP retains the attenuation phenotype of the live-attenuated RABV vaccine, and RVdelG-GP would appear to be an even safer alternative for use in wildlife or consideration for human use. We also further developed our vaccine constructs to use codon optimized filoviruses and have demonstrated immunogenicity and safety of these constructs in mice.  We have evaluated the codon optimized rabies-ebolavirus construct and demonstrated 83% protection in the absence of an adjuvant and 100% protection in the presence of an adjuvant.  Studies are ongoing to shift from a 2 dose schedule to a 3 dose schedule to reflect the human rabies virus vaccine schedule.  A clinical trial lot of the rabies-ebolavirus has been produced and a Phase I clinical trial is expected to start in the Fall of 2015.  The rabies-Marburg construct has demonstrated immunogenicity in mice and efficacy testing is scheduled to start in the Fall of 2015 in the mouse and nonhuman primate models of Marburg virus.3.Filovirus Molecular Virology We are also investigating molecular virology of filoviruses.  We are studying the role of phosphorylation of the viral proteins in the virus lifecycle. We have chosen to focus on VP35 as it is essential for transcription and replication of the genome. Using a replicon system we have generated point mutations and clustered point mutations of potential phosphorylation sites and evaluate the mutant for replication and transcription. Our data indicates a hierarchical phosphorylation strategy that regulates VP35 function. A second project involves identification of structure and function relationships of the EBOV noncoding regions.  We have identified host proteins that interact with these EBOV genome regions.  We are working to identify the proteins. We have identified HSC70 as interacting with at least one domain in the EBOV Trailer by pull-down assays and confirmed using immunoprecipitation-RT-PCR. Three HSC70 binding domains have been identified within the EBOV Trailer and mutational analysis of the 5 most region results in a decrease in replicon signal. We have complete SHAPE analysis of the EBOV Trailer and Leader to define the secondary structure of these untranslated regions. Based on these data we may identify therapeutic targets as well as establish mechanisms of filovirus lifecycle regulation.4. MERS-CoVWe have also been developing NHP models for MERS-CoV.  We have established that intratracheal exposure of rhesus monkeys with MERS-CoV Jordan isolate results in limited respiratory tract disease that peaks between days 4 and 5 post inoculation, resolves by day 9 post inoculation and can be quantified by computed tomography.  Inoculation of common marmosets resulted in a longer lived respiratory tract disease that peaks between days 3 and 14, but does not completely resolve, and can be monitored and quantified by computed tomography.  Furthermore, marmosets exposed to media alone or gamma-irradiated, inactivated virus develop similar disease as marmosets exposed to infectious virus. Infectious virus could not be recovered from serial samples in either rhesus or common marmosets.  To further develop the MERS-CoV model we are working with Dr. Ralph Baric to construct and evaluate a MERS-CoV that expresses the human sodium-iodide symporter that can be used as a PET reporter.  We expect this recombinant virus to provide enhanced detail on the infectious process of MERS in rabbits and NHPs.  We have also demonstrated efficacy of a transchromatic cow generated, fully humanized polyclonal antibody against MERS-CoV in the mouse hAd-DPP4 model of MERS developed in collaboration with SAB and NMRC.',\n",

       " 'This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to active immunity (preventive vaccines) and passive immunity (monoclonal antibodies) directed against HIV that are conducted by the VRC Clinical Trials Program (CTP) at the NIH Clinical Center. The clinical trials to evaluate candidate preventive HIV-1 vaccines have included: DNA vaccine constructs, a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5(rAd5) vaccine, and a recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 35 (rAd35) vaccine. Studies have been designed to evaluate dose, immunogenicity, route and device of administration, and prime-boost regimens. In FY15, the CTP continued evaluation of a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against HIV. A brief summary of each study to date follows.Prior to the establishment of the VRC Clinic, a Phase I study VRC 001 (01-I-0079) of a clade B, single plasmid DNA vaccine developed by VRC was conducted through collaboration with other intramural investigators.  A manuscript describing results was published in FY07: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2007. 44(5):p.601-5.VRC 004 (03-I-0022) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 4-plasmid DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP, which expresses a Gag-Pol-Nef polyprotein from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. This study evaluated the 2 mg, 4 mg and 8 mg dosage. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published: J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12):p.1650-60. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY08.VRC 006 (04-I-0128) was the first Phase I clinical trial of an investigational recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, for the prevention of HIV infection. This vaccine is composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a 3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode for the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively. This study evaluated three dosages. In FY07 a manuscript describing results was published: J Infect Dis, 2006. 194(12):p.1638-49. The long-term follow-up for the protocol was completed during FY09.VRC 007 (04-I-0254) was the first Phase I clinical trial of a multiclade 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA vaccine, VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, which expresses Gag, Pol and Nef proteins from clade B HIV-1 and Env glycoproteins from clades A, B and C. The 4 mg dosage was evaluated. In FY07 a manuscript describing study results was published: Vaccine, 2007. 25(20):p.4085-92. VRC 008 (05-I-0148) was a Phase I study of the prime-boost vaccination regimen consisting of 3 vaccinations with the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a boost with the rAd5 vaccine. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the DNA vaccine, as well as safety and immunogenicity of two different dosages for the rAd5 booster. The study was designed to enroll equal numbers of subjects with low and high antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the rAd5 booster. During FY08 week 94 long-term follow-up evaluations were completed and analysis of the primary immunogenicity assays were completed. A manuscript describing results from VRC 008 study was published: PLoS One, 2013; 8(4):e59340.VRC 009 (05-I-0081) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with the 4 mg or 8 mg dose of the 4-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 004 study. Ten subjects enrolled. Similarly, VRC 010 (05-I-0140) was a Phase I study of the rAd5 vaccine as a booster vaccination in subjects previously immunized with 4 mg of the 6-plasmid multiclade DNA vaccine in the VRC 007 study. Only a small number of subjects were eligible to participate; 4 subjects enrolled and completed the 24 weeks of follow-up.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 009 and 010 combined was published: PLoS One, Feb 2010, 5(2):p.1-15VRC 011 (06-I-0149) was a Phase I study to evaluate the intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration for priming vaccinations with either three injections of the 6-plasmid DNA vaccine or one injection of the rAd5 vaccine. In all schedules a rAd5 booster injection is administered IM. Sixty subjects were enrolled; equal numbers of subjects had negative and positive antibody titers to adenovirus serotype 5 at enrollment in order to gain a better understanding of whether pre-existing antibody affects the safety and immunogenicity of the regimens. Follow-up of study participants was completed during FY 09.  A manuscript describing results from VRC 011 was published: PLoS One, 2014 Mar 12;9(3).VRC 012 (07-I-0167) was a Phase I study to evaluate a novel prototype adenoviral vector serotype 35 vaccine (rAd 35-EnvA) at three dosages in Part I of the study and then in Part II of the study heterologous prime-boost schedules with an rAd5-EnvA vaccine will be evaluated. During FY08 the Part I enrollments and vaccinations were completed. The enrollments and study vaccinations for Part II of the study were completed in FY10.VRC 015 (08-I-0171) was a Phase I study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both Biojector and needle/syringe as injection devices for the recombinant serotype 5 adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP.  The enrollments and study vaccinations were completed in FY10; long-term follow-up was completed in FY14. A manuscript describing results was published: PLoS One. 2014 Sep 29;9(9). VRC 016 (11-I-0197) was a Phase Ib descriptive study to evaluate the kinetics and pattern of early innate and adaptive immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, alone and after priming with a DNA vaccine. This study was developed and initiated in FY11 and all follow-up completed in FY14.  HVTN 505 (09-I-0163) was a multicenter Phase 2b efficacy study of the VRC candidate DNA prime-rAd5 boost HIV vaccine regimen for which the VRC Clinical Trials Core is participating as a site. After Phase 1/2 safety and immunogenicity evaluations of the vaccines were completed, this study was developed in collaboration with the Division of AIDS and HVTN and designed to see whether or not the vaccines have efficacy in prevention of HIV or an effect on HIV viral load in vaccine recipients as compared to placebo recipients who acquire HIV infection during 2 years of follow-up. Study enrollments were completed in FY13. Study vaccinations were discontinued in April 2013 based on DSMB recommendations when study results showed that prospectively defined efficacy futility criteria had been met. Long term follow-up is ongoing.  A manuscript describing results from HVTN 505 was published: N Engl J Med. 2013 Nov 28;369(22):2083-92.VRC 602 (14-I-0019) was a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of a human monoclonal antibody, administered intravenously or subcutaneously to healthy adults.

       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flavivirus genus that has a global impact on public heath due to its widespread distribution and the ability to cause severe disease in humans. Each year, an estimated 390 million individuals are infected by DENV, with clinical manifestations ranging from a self-limiting acute febrile illness (dengue fever) to a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by plasma leakage and shock (dengue hemorrhagic fever; DHF). Four related serotypes of DENV circulate in nature, each capable of causing the full spectrum of DENV-related disease.  Prospective clinical studies clearly demonstrate that sequential infection with two DENV serotypes is associated with a more severe disease course.  The number of DHF cases reported has increased dramatically during the past twenty years, and now exceeds 250,000 cases annually. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine for all four serotypes of DENV.Neutralizing antibodies play an important role in protection against flavivirus infection. Antibodies have been mapped to all three structural domains of the E protein (DI-DIII) that exhibit varying degrees of neutralization potency and confer protection by multiple effector mechanisms. Eliciting neutralizing antibody is a major goal of vaccine development. Complicating these efforts is a requirement for vaccines to simultaneously elicit protection against four different viruses that while antigenically related, share only some of the antibody-binding determinants thought to contribute to virus neutralization. Thus, antibodies raised against one serotype of DENV may react with virions of another serotype, but often with reduced affinity and functional potency.Paradoxically, antibodies may also play a role in enhancing virus infection and exacerbating disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) describes a dramatic increase in infection of Fc-receptor-bearing cells in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibody or immune sera. The most direct link between ADE and the clinical outcome of DENV infection comes from investigations of the unusually large number of severe DENV cases following primary infection observed in infants during the first year of life. In a broader context, antibodies elicited by primary infection with one serotype of DENV may bind related viruses introduced during secondary infection with reduced avidity, resulting in engagement of the virion with a stoichiometry that does not permit virus neutralization but can support ADE. The development of an immune response that elicits protective levels of neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of virus present in the vaccine is a key factor for reducing the risk of ADE.The development of a protective tetravalent response is complicated by the possibility that all four components of a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine may not be equally immunogenic in the vaccinee. Interference and uneven levels of infectivity among DENV strains in this context has been reported. Understanding the immunogenicity of each component of a tetravalent vaccine is an important aspect of vaccine development and identifying appropriate correlates of protection, particularly because it is presently unclear how many serotype-specific responses will be required for protection from all four serotypes of DENV. However, dissecting the specific contribution of each element of a tetravalent vaccine is technically challenging due to the presence of antibodies that bind cross-reactive determinants shared by different components of the vaccine. A detailed map of the functionally important type-specific and group-reactive epitopes on the E protein is not presently available. Improved methodology that distinguishes and quantifies the functional contribution of each component of a tetravalent vaccine would allow for improvements in estimates of vaccine immunogenicity, a more precise correlate of protection, and a powerful investigational tool to study vaccine success and failure.',\n",
       " 'The epidemiological success of IAV relies on airborne transmission from person-to-person; however, the viral properties governing airborne transmission of IAV are complex. Receptor-binding specificity is an important determinant of host-range restriction and transmission of IAV. The ability of zoonotic IAV for airborne transmission increases their pandemic potential. IAV infection is mediated via binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to terminally attached 2,3 or 2,6 sialic acids (SA) on cell surface glycoproteins. Human IAV preferentially bind 2,6-linked SA while avian IAV bind 2,3-linked SA on complex glycans on airway epithelial cells. Historically, IAV with preferential association with 2,3-linked SA have not transmitted efficiently by the airborne route in ferrets. We used an epidemiologically successful IAV in which we altered receptor preference from the human (2,6SA) to the avian receptor (2,3SA) and observed efficient airborne transmission. Airborne transmission was associated with rapid selection of virus with a change at a single HA site which conferred binding to long-chain 2,6SA, without loss of 2,3SA binding. The transmissible virus emerged in experimentally infected ferrets within 24 hours post-infection and was remarkably enriched in the soft palate, where long-chain 2,6SA predominate on the nasopharyngeal surface. Importantly, presence of long-chain 2,6SA is conserved in ferret, pig and human soft palate. Using a loss-of-function approach with this one virus, we demonstrate that the ferret soft palate, a tissue not normally sampled, rapidly selects for transmissible IAV with human receptor (2,6SA) preference. Vaccination remains the primary strategy for the preventing severe influenza. Owing to antigenic drift in circulating viruses, a vaccine from one season may not be effective in subsequent seasons, so annual immunization is needed to maintain immunity. Each year, the strains that are to be included in the vaccine for the next influenza season are chosen by the WHO collaborating centers. With the view of improving live vaccine efficacy, reducing the time of vaccine production, and limiting the interference of pre-existing immunity to the vaccine backbone, novel approaches to vaccine development are being investigated. Codon-pair bias de-optimization (CPBD) of viruses involves re-writing viral genes using statistically underrepresented codon pairs, without any changes to the amino acid sequence. Previously, this technology has been used to attenuate the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The de-optimized virus was immunogenic and protected inbred mice from challenge. In order to assess whether CPBD could be used to produce a live vaccine against a clinically relevant influenza virus, we generated an influenza A/California/07/2009 pandemic H1N1 (2009 pH1N1) virus with de-optimized HA and NA gene segments (2009 pH1N1-(HA+NA)Min ), and evaluated viral replication and protein expression in MDCK cells, and attenuation,  immunogenicity, and efficacy in outbred ferrets. The 2009 pH1N1-(HA+NA)Min virus grew to a similar titer as the 2009 pH1N1 wild type (wt) virus in MDCK cells (106 TCID50 /ml), despite reduced HA and NA protein expression on western blot. In ferrets, intranasal inoculation of 2009 pH1N1-(HA+NA)Min virus at doses ranging from 103 to 105  TCID50 led to seroconversion in all animals and protection from challenge with the 2009 pH1N1 wt virus 28 days later. The 2009 pH1N1-(HA+NA)Min virus did not cause clinical illness in ferrets, but replicated to a similar titer as the wt virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract, suggesting that de-optimization of additional gene segments may be warranted for improved attenuation. Taken together, our data demonstrate the potential of using CPBD technology for the development of a live influenza virus vaccine if the level of attenuation is optimized.',\n",
       " \"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the world, causing serious complications on women's reproductive health including ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. C. trachomatis also causes infection of the eye resulting in inflammation and in some cases blindness. The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics, and pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infections in different population settings, including populations in resource constrained countries. We have used the Internet site www.iwantthekit.org since 2004 to offer sampling in Maryland and other areas in the U.S. for chlamydia screening in over 7,000 women and 3800 men using self-obtained vaginal swabs, penile-meatal swabs and rectal samples. Samples were also tested for gonorrhea and trichomonas. Prevalence of chlamydia for women overall was 6.3% and 10.3% in young women age 15-19 yr.  Both young age and Black race were statistically associated with chlamydia positivity. For men, the overall chlamydia prevalence was 6.2%. Acceptance for self-collecting penile and rectal swabs has been very high. Rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence for males was 2.7% and 2.7%, respectively. Rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence in wome was 6.4% and 1.1%, respectively. To study the capability for performing a point-of-care self-test for trichomonas at home, we recently enrolled 102 women who performed the mailed test successfully at home.  The test demonstrated high accuracy and high acceptability and will be added to our surveys.Oral treatment of chlamydia with 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for 7 days or with a single 1-g dose of azithromycin has been recommended since 1996. A meta-analysis of 23 randomized trials indicated that the efficacy of doxycycline was 3 percentage points higher than that of azithromycin for the treatment of urogenital chlamydia and 7 percentage points higher than that of azithromycin for the treatment of symptomatic males. In a randomized trial, directly observed treatment with doxycycline had a 100% cure rate, as compared with a 97% cure rate for azithromycin treatment. The reasons for the lower efficacy of azithromycin remain unclear. Drug resistance of chlamydia has not been definitively established. Some patients may not have sustained mucosal levels of azithromycin that are sufficient to eradicate chlamydia, and the infection may therefore be driven to a persistent viable state. Azithromycin may be more efficacious for the treatment of upper reproductive tract infection. With the above caveats in mind, it seems reasonable to recommend doxycycline over azithromycin as the preferred regimen for chlamydia treatment. However, because of low adherence with 7 days of doxycycline in some studies and the finding of very high efficacy (97% and 100%) for both treatments, we recommend that either drug be used in the treatment of persons with chlamydia infection. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis infection is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. The WHO has recommended that three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics be offered to control the disease in districts where the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is >10% in children aged 1-9 years, with treatment coverage of at least 80%. We have conducted both surgical and antibiotic treatment intervention studies in Gambia, Niger, and Tanzania in efforts to control trachoma. However, the source of infection following mass treatment is often unknown. If migrants into a village undergoing MDA are shown to impede progress towards elimination, then a local strategy that addresses treatment of new families and a nationwide strategy that addresses migration will be needed. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of migrants on the prevalence of infection and clinical trachoma in communities. In four communities in Kongwa, Tanzania, all children were enrolled in a longitudinal study of infection and trachoma. New children were identified at census updates as having not been in the community at the previous census. Within communities, neighborhoods were defined as spatially close groups of households. Children who were migrants were more likely to be infected and to have trachoma than children who were resident in the community, which was significant by the time of the survey following the third year of MDA (odds ratio, OR, 2.49, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.036.05). The neighborhoods where newcomers resided were more likely to have infection a year later than neighborhoods with no migrants, which was most pronounced following the third year of MDA (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.077.65). In summary, migrants to communities may be an important source of re-emergent infection, especially as MDA lowers infection among residents. Highly migrant populations may need a special surveillance and treatment program to avoid slowing progress in communities under MDA.Recent work on a test for antibodies to C. trachomatis antigens suggests serology is a promising tool that indicates cumulative risk of exposure to C. trachomatis. If serology can be used in the youngest age groups to monitor evidence of exposure since the cessation of mass antibiotic provision, it may prove to be a useful tool for confirming interruption of transmission. In a trachoma-endemic district in Tanzania that stopped its program four years ago, we undertook a surveillance survey, adding to the assessment of TF a lab test for C. trachomatis infection, and a dried blood spot which was processed for antibodies to C. trachomatis antigen pgp3; antibody status may indicate cumulative past exposure to infection. The prevalence of TF was 0.4%, below the 5% cut-off indicating that trachoma elimination had been achieved with no re-emergence. The antibody positivity overall was low, 7.5%, and increased with age from 5.2% in 13 year olds, to 9.3% in 79 year olds (p = 0.015). In 16 of the 30 hamlets, no children aged 13 years old had antibodies to pgp3. The antibody status of the 13 year olds indicated low cumulative exposure to infection during the surveillance period. In summary, four years post -program, there is no evidence for re-emergence of trachoma using any indicator sufficient to indicate re-emergence.\",\n",
       " 'The major obstacle of basic and antiviral research in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the lack of readily accessible, physiological cell culture systems permissive for viral infection and replication. Here we describe a highly physiological HBV infection model by using human hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Differentiated HLCs present key features of mature hepatocytes. Notably, the expression of viral receptor sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is more stable in HLCs than in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). HLCs support a robust and productive HBV infection that can be manipulated either by siRNA down-regulation of certain host factors involved in HBV replication or antiviral treatment. Unlike other in vitro models, HLCs support HBV spreading. By using this model, we identified two host-targeting agents, Genistin and PA452, as novel antivirals against HBV infection. HLC is a superior model for antiviral testing than NTCP over-expressing hepatoma cell lines. Genistin shows antiviral activities only in HLCs and PHHs but not in HepG2-NTCP or Huh7-NTCP cells. This novel HBV infection HLCs model offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of molecular details of the HBV life cycle, to further characterize virus-host interactions and to define new targets for HBV curative treatment.While the innate immune responses are generally the first line of defense against invading pathogens, it is controversial whether HBV replicates without activating the innate immunity or actively inhibits the innate pathways in the hepatocytes. To address this question, we used various hepatocyte culture models including hepatoma cell lines expressing viral receptor-NTCP, stem cell-derived hepatocytes and primary human hepatocytes. Using either transfection of HBV genome-containing plasmids or infection by infectious cell culture-generated HBV or patient-derived virus in human hepatoma cell lines and primary or stem cell-derived human hepatocytes, we have established various cell culture models of HBV infection and replication. Despite a robust HBV replication, no interferons (IFNs) or IFN-stimulated genes were induced. Using primary human hepatocyte engrafted SCID mice, HBV infection was established in vivo. At the peak of viremia, no induction of human IFN could be detected in the liver. These observations indicated a lack of innate immunity in terms of interferon response in HBV infected hepatocytes. To study if HBV actively inhibits innate immune sensing, poly IC and Sendai virus, known to be a potent inducer of interferon response, were tested in hepatocyte culture that were infected with HBV. Both type I and III IFNs as well as IFN-stimulated genes were strongly induced by the poly IC or Sendai virus. But concurrent HBV infection did not affect the magnitude nor breadth of this response. Confocal microscopy at single cell level further confirmed that HBV infected hepatocytes exhibited strong nuclear IRF3 and STAT1 expression after Sendai virus infection, similar to that of non-infected cells. Since HCV is known to induce a robust interferon response in infected hepatocytes, we also examined the interferon response in the HBV/ HCV co-infection setting. We co-infected HBV and HCV in primary human hepatocytes and studied their replication and the interferon response. We observed that HBV did not alter HCV replication nor down-regulate the well-known induction of interferon response by HCV, as compared to the HCV mono-infection. This finding supports the notion that HBV does not actively interfere with the innate sensing mechanism of the hepatocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that HBV behaves like a stealth virus and is not sensed by the innate immunity of the infected hepatocytes, potentially explaining the propensity of HBV to chronic infection.',\n",
       " 'Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) causes genital herpes and increases the risk of transmission and infection with HIV.  Thus a vaccine for HSV-2 would not only reduce the rate of genital herpes, but also might reduce spread of HIV. Several HSV-2 vaccines have been tested in humans for prevention or reduction of genital herpes disease, but none has been licensed for use in humans. This year we completed a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of a replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine, in humans. This vaccine was developed by Dr. David Knipe at Harvard, and our lab performed much of the preclinical work in mice and guinea pigs.  We studied antibody responses in the vaccine recipients and collaborated with David Koelle at the University of Washington to study cellular immune responses to the vaccine.  We are currently validating the clinical data and hope to unblind the study later this year to determine safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine.  We have also developed a live attenuated candidate HSV vaccine.  We postulated that live attenuated HSV-2 would provide more HSV antigens for induction of virus-specific antibodies and cellular immunity than would a subunit HSV vaccine. We previously reported an HSV-2 mutant, HSV2-gD27, in which the nectin-1 binding domain of glycoprotein D (gD2) is altered so that the virus is impaired for infecting neural cells, but not epithelial cells, in vitro and is impaired for infecting dorsal root ganglia in mice.  This year we reported that the mutations in HSV2-gD27 were stable when the virus was passaged in cell culture and during acute infection of mice. HSV2-gD27 was attenuated in mice when it was inoculated onto the cornea, intramuscularly (i.m.), intravaginally, and intracranially. Vaccination of mice i.m. with HSV2-gD27 provided better inhibition of challenge virus replication in the vagina than when the virus was used to vaccinate mice intranasally or subcutaneously. Comparison of i.m. vaccinations with HSV2-gD27 versus an HSV glycoprotein subunit vaccine (gD2t) in adjuvant showed that HSV2-gD27 induced larger reductions of challenge virus replication in the vagina and reduced latent viral loads in dorsal root ganglia but induced lower serum neutralizing antibody titers than those obtained with gD2t in adjuvant. Taken together, our data indicate that a live attenuated HSV-2 vaccine impaired for infection of neurons provides better protection from vaginal challenge with HSV-2 than that obtained with a subunit vaccine, despite inducing lower titers of HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies in the serum.We collaborated with Immune Design Corporation to test a novel HSV2 vaccine candidate, G103, consisting of three recombinantly expressed HSV-2 proteins (gD and the UL19 and UL25 gene products) adjuvanted with a TLR4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A (GLA) formulated in stable emulsion. Vaccination of mice with G103 elicited antigen-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as robust CD4 and CD8 effector and memory T cells. The T cell responses were further boosted by subsequent challenge with live virus. Prophylactic immunization completely protected against lethal intravaginal HSV-2 infection in mice, with only transient replication of virus in the genital mucosa and sterilizing immunity in dorsal root ganglia.  The vaccine expanded both CD4 and CD8 T cells induced in mice by previous infection with HSV-2. In the guinea pig model of recurrent HSV-2 infection, therapeutic immunization with G103 was approximately 50% effective in reducing the number of lesions per animal as well as the overall lesions score.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 50 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and caused up to 18,000 deaths in the U.S. and up to 575,000 deaths globally. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Efforts to identify pre-1918 influenza virus RNA-positive autopsy material are continuing. Possible fatal influenza pneumonia cases from 1907-1917 have been identified in tissue archives and anonymized materials are being screened for host and viral RNA by RT-PCR. In a related effort, a method has been developed allowing high-throughput deep sequencing of host, viral, and bacterial RNA from archival tissue samples.  This method significantly reduces ribosomal RNA allowing sequence analysis of viral and host mRNA expression and identification of secondary bacterial infections. Lastly, receptor specificity of variant 1918 influenza A virus hemagglutinins was evaluated in vitro in primary human airway cells.',\n",
       " \"Many of arthropod-borne viruses are emerging and re-emerging human pathogens that have caused outbreaks of the devastating and often fatal diseases and represent a serious public health problem in many regions of the world. During the past decades, neurotropic arboviruses mainly belonging to the Flaviviridae and Togaviridae families (CHIKV, JE, TBEV, WN, SLE, and ZIKV viruses) unexpectedly spread in many new geographic areas of the world which resulted in severe impact on wildlife and increase in the number of flavivirus-associated illnesses in humans. Currently, WN is the major source of viral encephalitis in the USA. During the 1999-2015 epidemics, nearly 3 million people were infected with WN in the US, with about 20,170 CDC-reported cases of neuroinvasive disease and 1884 deaths. Over the last decade, CHIKV and ZIKV viruses had emerged explosively in the Latin America affecting an estimated 1 to 2 million people. Of main public health concern with ZIKV epidemics is the increase of the severity disease that has never been observed in other flavivirus infections and associated with catastrophic fetal abnormalities including microcephaly and spontaneous abortion. Compared to the natural transmission cycle of other RNA viruses, arboviruses need to replicate in two hosts: vertebrate and invertebrate vector (mosquito, tick or other arthropod). Surprisingly, unlike other members of the Flaviviridae family, ZIKV was able to establish long-term persistence in vertebrate hosts and utilize a sexual mode of virus transmission, posing new challenges for controlling virus outbreaks. The spread of tick- and mosquito-borne viruses in new areas and the increase in incidence of arbovirus-associated illness highlight the need for efficacious vaccines, antiviral drugs, and novel approaches for vector control. Live attenuated vaccine candidates against neurotropic flaviviruses (JE, WN, SLE, TBEV) are being developed in the LID using the strategies based on (1) chimerization of a neurovirulent virus with a non-neuroinvasive dengue type 4 flavivirus (DEN4), (2) introduction of attenuating mutations, (3) targeting of viral genome for cellular microRNAs (miRNAs), and (4) genetic order gene repositioning within the virus genome. The pathogenesis of neurotropic infections involves two distinct properties of the viruses: neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. Thus, the research in our lab aims first to prevent the virus entry into the central nervous system (CNS) and second to restrict its replication in the neurons. The most attenuated vaccine candidates were then evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, their ability to protect mice and monkeys against challenge with wild-type virus.JE, SLE and WN vaccines: A WN vaccine (WN/DEN4d30 virus) is a chimeric virus in which the prM and E genes of the DEN4 virus have been replaced by those of WN. In previous clinical trials, a WN/DEN4d30 has been shown to be safe and effective in healthy adults aged 18-50 years. However, older adults are more susceptible to the neuroinvasive WN disease that can be accompanied by a high mortality rate.  Based on our previous data, a dose of 10,000 PFU was selected for 2015-16 clinical studies to further evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the WN vaccine in flavivirus-naive elderly volunteers, adults 50-65 years of age, and have found it to be safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic. Immunization with a single vaccine dose produces high levels of neutralizing antibody against wild-type WN strains, inducing a 95% rate of seroconversion in the volunteers. These results suggest that a single dose of vaccine may be sufficient to induce a protective antibody response. As outbreaks of WN tend to be unpredictable, a safe and effective vaccine in the vulnerable elderly population will be an important public health tool against severe neuroinvasive WN disease. During recent years, we developed a general approach to control flavivirus tissue tropism and pathogenesis by targeting virus genome (TBEV/DEN4 chimera) with cellular brain-expressed microRNAs (Teterina et al., 2014). This work demonstrated that miRNA targeting is a rational method for flavivirus attenuation and was utilized in FY2016 for WN, JE, and SLE vaccine development with an end goal of generating the trivalent vaccine. Next generation of vaccine candidates was engineered by introducing multiple targets for the CNS-specific miRNAs into WN/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4 genomes. Each monovalent vaccine candidate (WN/DEN4 or SLE/DEN4 miRNA-targeted viruses) demonstrated reduced neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence in suckling mice and provided complete protection against parental WN or SLE challenge. In addition, a single dose of bivalent vaccine formulations (1000 or 1000 PFU of WN/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4 miRNA-targeted viruses) induced the strong neutralizing WN- and SLE-specific antibody responses and protected mice against both wild-type viruses. In addition, JE/DEN4 viruses were generated recently in which the targets for brain-specific mir-124 miRNA in the E protein gene were combined with additional miRNA-targets located in the 3'NCR. Currently, we are working to identify the most attenuated JE vaccine candidate for neuropathogenesis in mice that will be used as a third component of the combined trivalent vaccine against WN, SLE and JE.TBEV vaccine: The TBEV vaccine candidates are chimeric viruses carrying the prM and E structural protein genes of Far Eastern TBEV and remaining sequences derived from either (1) a non-neuroinvasive DEN4 (TBEV/DEN4), (2) a naturally attenuated, tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) strain E5 (TBEV/E5) or (3) a most immunogenic LGT strain T1674 (TBEV/LGT). The large set of modified TBEV/DEN4 and TBEV/LGT was generated by introducing the cassettes of brain-specific miRNA-targets into three distant regions of chimeric DEN4- or LGT-based genome, etc., in the duplicated capsid gene region, the duplicated E gene region, and the 3NCR. In FY2016, we identified 11 most promising vaccine candidates that were restricted for replication in the brain of newborn mice and had significantly limited neuroinvasiveness in immunodeficient mice. Currently, comparative studies for evaluation of protective efficacy against TBEV challenge in mice and immunogenicity in rhesus monkeys of these selected miRNA-targeted viruses (DEN4- and LGT-based viruses) are underway. Flaviviruses are transmitted in nature by their specific arthropod vector, and the environmental safety of live attenuated vaccines is a significant concern. Hypothetically, the DEN4- or LGT-based vaccine viruses have a potential for reversion back to wild-type that could be associated with possible dissemination of these mutated viruses by mosquitoes or ticks after feeding on vaccinees. Using a DEN4 virus as a model system, we demonstrated that targeting of mosquito-borne DEN4 genome for mosquito-specific mir-184 and mir-275 miRNAs abolishes virus transmission by its natural vectors: Aedes aegypti and Aedes. albopictus mosquitoes, which are the competent vectors for many arboviruses. Unlike mosquito-borne viruses, tick-borne flaviviruses can be efficiently transmitted between co-feeding ticks at each life cycle stage of tick development (larvae, nymphs and adults). In FY2016, we showed that insertion of target sequences for tick-specific miRNAs (mir-1, mir-275 and mir-279) individually or in combination into tick-borne LGT genome caused selective attenuation of virus replication in tick-derived cells. In addition, simultaneous dual miRNA targeting for tick- and vertebrate CNS-specific miRNAs led to silencing of virus replication in live Ixodes ticks and abolished virus neurotropism in highly permissive newborn mice. We believe that the developed miRNA co-targeting approach can be adapted to support the design of environmentally safe vaccines.\",\n",
       " 'The immune responses to Pneumocystis are poorly understood, but cytokines may play a role in both clearing Pneumocystis infection and in the hypoxia associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia that may be exacerbated following initiation of therapy.  We are using the scid mouse model, as well as other immunodeficient mice, to further evaluate the role of individual cytokines and other immunoregulatory molecules in modulating Pneumocystis infection.  We have developed a real time PCR assay to quantitate Pneumocystis over a wide dynamic range, and are currently examining Pneumocystis infection in healthy animals to better understand immune responses in the normal host.  Using microarrays, we have been able to identify genes that are differentially expressed during Pneumocystis infection in healthy compared to immunodeficient mice; the majority of differentially expressed genes are related to the immune system.  Immunohistochemical studies of the lungs done in parallel have demonstrated that there is an influx of CD4 cells and macrophages at 5 weeks, and, surprisingly, an influx of B cells at 6 weeks in immunocompetent mice but not CD40L KO mice.  Microarray studies suggest that the B cells persist through at least 10 weeks, well after the infection has been cleared.We have extended these studies to examine immune responses in other immunodeficient mice, including those with defective innate immune responses, such as Myd88 knockout mice which are deficient in TLR signals, and CDld KO mice, which lack NKT cells.  Our studies have shown that these mice are not susceptible to uncontrolled Pneumocystis infection, suggesting that neither TLR signaling, nor NKT cells are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with Philip Murphy, Michail Lionakis, and their groups, we have examined changes in expression of a variety of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, using Taqman real-time PCR assays, and have been able to identify CCR2 and its ligands as potentially important in the response to Pneumocystis infection.  However, in examining the susceptibility of CCR2 knock-out mice to Pneumocystis infection, we found that they are able to clear infection similar to wild-type animals.  We also examined CX3CR1 knock-out mice for susceptibility to Pneumocystis infection, since CX3CR1 and its ligand identify alternately activated macrophages and are critical to clearance of another fungus, Candida, in mouse models.  These mice were again able to clear Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice.  Using microarray analysis of purified CD4 cells isolated from lungs of Pneumocystis-infected mice, we were able to show that CXCR6 is preferentially upregulated compared to cells from uninfected animals, and by Q-PCR that both CXCR6 and its ligand, CXCL16, are unregulated in lung tissue from immunocompetent Pneumocystis-infected mice. We are currently examining the role of CXCR6 in controlling Pneumocystis infection through use of CXCR6 knock-out mice. To allow us to evaluate immune responses more easily, we have developed a multiplex assay that allows the evaluation of expression levels of 30 genes simultaneously, using branched DNA amplification combined with Luminex bead technology.  We are using this assay to examine the lungs of various strains of knock-out mice at different stages of Pneumocystis infection, to determine if their immune responses are similar to those seen in healthy, immunocompetent mice.We are examining the kinetics of immune responses in the lung of healthy animals exposed to Pneumocystis, using flow cytometry.  We have found that interferon-gamma, and less predictably, IL-17, expression are increased in lymphocytes of the lung, primarily CD4 cells, during Pneumocystis infection and clearance, suggesting that Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cells may play a role in clearing infection. In follow-up, we found that IL-17A knockout mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, thus demonstrating that IL-17 is not critical to control of Pneumocystis infection. We are extending these studies to look at Th2 and Treg cells in the lung  during Pneumocystis infection in  healthy mice, and also plan to utilize an anti-interferon-gamma to see how it impacts control of infection and to see how other T cells respond in the setting of impaired Th1 cell function. We have recently examined the contribution of beta-glucans in cysts to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We have demonstrated that, similar to other pathogenic fungi, glucans are to a large extent masked by surface proteins in 3 Pneumocystis species (P. murina, P. carinii, and P. jirovecii). Moreover, we have shown, by comparing infected mice treated with caspofungin, an inhibitor of beta 1,3 glucan synthase, to untreated mice, that beta-glucans are major contributors to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.We are also examining the response of dendritic cells to the most abundant Pneumocystis antigens, the major surface glycoprotein (MSG).  Finally, we are performing reconstitution studies in CD40KO mice, to try to identify which cells are critical to the mounting an effective immune response against Pneumocystis.  For these studies we use CD45 allelic variants as donors to allow us to track transferred cells.  We have been able to show that unfractionated spleen cells from immunocompetent mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, and are currently examining which subpopulations of cells can confer this protection. Preliminary studies suggest that B cells play an important role in conferring long-lasting protection.  We are further examining the role of B cells by performing immune reconstitution studies using B cells that are quasimonoclonal, to help determine if antibody production or, alternatively, other properties of B cells, such as antigen presentation, are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  It is hoped that these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms critical for control of Pneumocystis infection in the healthy host, and may provide mechanisms for increasing clearance of Pneumocystis or decreasing the inflammation that may be causing hypoxia.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and are the cause of yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and West Nile fever syndromes. In recent years, much of our laboratory effort was focused on the development and preclinical testing of dengue virus vaccine candidates suitable for inclusion in a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials, and several tetravalent vaccine admixtures have also recently been evaluated in human subjects. An optimal tetravalent admixture (TV005) has been selected and has now entered Phase II and III evaluation. Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of important functions, including, 1) manufacture, replacement, maintenance, stability/sterility analysis, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) basic research on virus stabilization and lyophilization processes, 3) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations, 4) support of the six companies/institutions that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes, preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, assistance with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data, 5) support of collaborations with investigators interested in basic virology or immunology studies, 6) use of immune cells collected from our clinical studies to investigate the innate immune response to vaccination, 7) development of antigenic cartography methods for the analysis antibody responses to dengue virus.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the Asia Pacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory and it is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second generation pentavalent vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia. The laboratory has recovered numerous engineered viruses and has evaluated their pathogenicity in mice. The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations. Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes. Following evaluation in mice, a number of these recombinant viruses look suitable for consideration as vaccine candidates. With the emergence of Zika virus in the Western hemisphere and the ongoing public health emergency, our attention has been focused on the development of live attenuated vaccine candidates that would be compatible for co-formulation with our tetravalent dengue vaccine.  Recombinant chimeric viruses expressing the prM and E proteins of Zika virus on either the DENV-2 or DENV-4 background have been generated and are undergoing pre-clinical characterization.  In addition, serum from Zika patients in Latin America has been received and used to isolate Zika virus strains for use in developing the human challenge model.',\n",

       " 'Influenza A viruses (IAV) are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses continue to circulate enzootically in poultry in many countries and continue to cause human infections. Recently a novel avian H7N9 strain emerged in China also causing human infections and fatalities. A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to model host adaptation, map viral virulence factors and host factors in disease progression, evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines were performed.Pneumonia due to viral and bacterial infections is a leading cause of death in children and adults worldwide. Severe influenza and bacterial co-infection induce hypoxic respiratory failure, manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Preclinical models of severe influenza infection that closely correlate to human disease are needed to assess efficacy of new vaccines and therapeutics. We developed a nonhuman primate model of influenza and bacterial co-infection that recapitulates severe pneumonia in humans. Animals were infected with influenza A virus via intra-bronchial or small-particle aerosol inoculation, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or co-infected with influenza and methicillin-resistant S. aureus combined. We assessed the severity of disease in animals over the course of our study using tools available to evaluate critically ill human patients including high-resolution computed tomography imaging of the lungs, arterial blood gas analyses, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Using an intra-bronchial route of inoculation we successfully induced severe pneumonia following influenza infection alone and following influenza and bacterial co-infection. Peak illness was observed at day 6 post-influenza infection, manifested by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia. The timing of radiographic and physiologic manifestations of disease in our model closely match those observed in severe human influenza infection. This was the first nonhuman primate study of influenza and bacterial co-infection where high-resolution computed tomography scanning of the lungs was used to quantitatively assess pneumonia over the course of illness and where hypoxemia was correlated with pneumonia severity. With additional validation this model may serve as a pathway for regulatory approval of vaccines and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of severe influenza pneumonia.To study bacterial co-infection following 1918 H1N1 influenza virus infection, mice were inoculated with the 1918 influenza virus, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) 72h later. Co-infected mice exhibited markedly more severe disease, shortened survival time and more severe lung pathology, including widespread thrombi. Transcriptional profiling revealed activation of coagulation only in co-infected mice, consistent with the extensive thrombogenesis observed. Immunohistochemistry showed extensive expression of tissue factor (F3) and prominent deposition of neutrophil elastase on endothelial and epithelial cells in co-infected mice. Lung sections of SP-positive 1918 autopsy cases showed extensive thrombi and prominent staining for F3 in alveolar macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, endothelial and epithelial cells, in contrast to co-infection-positive 2009 pandemic H1N1 autopsy cases. This study reveals that a distinctive feature of 1918 influenza virus and SP co-infection in mice and humans is extensive expression of tissue factor and activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway leading to widespread pulmonary thrombosis.Influenza virus infections are a global public health problem, with a significant impact of morbidity and mortality from both annual epidemics and pandemics. The current strategy for preventing annual influenza is to develop a new vaccine each year against specific circulating virus strains. Because these vaccines are unlikely to protect against an antigenically divergent strain or a new pandemic virus with a novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtype, there is a critical need for vaccines that protect against all influenza A viruses, a so-called  universal  vaccine. Recent work has suggested that such broadly protective, or  universal , influenza virus vaccines might be achievable using vaccine strategies that target conserved B- and T-cell epitopes.',\n",
       " 'Our main vaccine platform is based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSVs), a live-attenuate vaccine approach. Over the years we have generated several rVSVs expressing the glycoproteins (GP) of representative isolates of all species of Ebola virus: Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Tai forest ebolavirus (TFEBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). Additionally, we generated rVSVs expressing the GPs of two isolates of Marburg virus: Lake Victoria marburgvirus isolate Musoke and Angola. All vaccine vectors have been extensively characterized in cell culture and their protective efficacy has been evaluated in animal models (rodents, nonhuman primates) against homologous challenges. In an effort to decipher the mechanism of protection of the rVSV vaccine vectors we used the rVSV/ZEBOVgp as a model. We could demonstrate in nonhuman primates that antibodies specific to the foreign immunogen play a critical role in protection. Recent similar work also confirmed a role of antibodies for the mechanism of protection mediated by the rVSV vaccine vector against MARV. Overall, we postulate that antibodies (total and neutralizing IgG) play a key role for the mechanism of protection for all rVSV-based vaccine candidates.   In response to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine candidate was fast-tracked and shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans. Phase III clinical trials with this vaccine candidate were initiated in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. To support the clinical trials we have shown that the GMP-produced rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine lot used in West Africa protects against challenge with a recent local isolate, a proof that had been missing at trial start. A recent preliminary report published in Lancet from the human trial in Guinea reports success of the rVSV/ZEBOVgp vaccine in a ring vaccination approach. This remarkable outcome is supported by another recent study of our group in nonhuman primates looking into the minimum time needed for protection. We could demonstrate complete protection when rVSV/ZEBOVgp was administered at least one week and partial protection when administered as close as three days prior to challenge. Overall, this is a milestone achievement in the development of Ebola countermeasures. Cross-protection among the different Ebola and Marburg virus species is an important consideration, but is thought to be difficult to achieve due to relatively high genetic variability and the general lack of cross-protective antibodies among genera in particular, but also among species within a single genus. In a first attempt to address this issue, we previously used a single-injection protocol with three blended vaccine vectors (rVSV/SEBOVgp, rVSV/ZEBOVgp and rVSV/MARVgp) and demonstrated complete protection against challenge with the three homologous virus species. We have also performed another proof-of-concept study, in which we evaluated cross-protection following immunization with a single vaccine vector (rVSV/ZEBOVgp or rVSV/CIEBOVgp) and demonstrated partial cross-protection against challenge with a heterologous virus species (BEBOV). This demonstrates that monovalent rVSV-based vaccines may be useful against a newly emerging filovirus species; however, heterologous protection across species remains challenging and may depend on enhancing the immune responses either through booster immunizations or through the inclusion of multiple immunogens. Overall, we can conclude that single monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors can provide partial cross-protection in cases of challenge virus species that are genetically more closely related.As mentioned above, one approach to overcome this limitation is the use of blended monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors, which provide broader protection against homologous and partial protection against certain heterologous challenges. Another approach to overcome the limitations in cross-protection is the use of multivalent rVSV vaccine vectors. In a proof-of-concept study in rodent models protection against ZEBOV and Andes virus (ANDV) or ZEBOV and influenza virus (H5N1) challenge was demonstrated using a single rVSV vector expressing both the ZEBOVgp and the ANDV glycoprotein or ZEBOVgp and a H5 hemagglutinin, respectively. This data showed that the use of bivalent rVSV vectors are a feasible approach to vaccination against multiple pathogens. Based on the results described above, we have over the past two fiscal year successfully generated additional bivalent and trivalent rVSV vectors expressing two or three different filovirus GPs, one as a transmembrane protein (replacing the VSV glycoprotein) and one or two as soluble glycoproteins that will be secreted during vector replication. Recovery of these recombinant vaccine viruses turned out to be difficult but has recently been successful. In vitro characterization of these vectors, including viral growth curves and verification of foreign immunogen expression has been completed. Efficacy testing in the Ebola and Marburg hamster models has resulted in promising results; nonhuman primate studies are scheduled.',\n",
       " \"Dengue virus (DENV) infection has reached epidemic proportions in many countries in South America andSoutheast Asia, with most experts advocating for a safe and efficacious vaccine to stop dissemination andreduce viral economic and disease burden. Advanced clinical trials of the Sanofi-Pasteur chimeric DENV-yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine reported only partial protection and did not show efficacy against all DENVserotypes or in DENV-naive subjects. Most concerning, recent data has indicated that the Sanofi vaccine mightenhance symptomatic disease in naive subjects, which has raised questions as to its eventual deployment.The lack of established immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection has hampered the development of asafe efficacious vaccine to DENV and to several other infectious diseases. Recent conceptual andtechnological advances in our understanding of effector mechanisms of cell and humoral immunity pave theway forward for implementing new assays that identify mechanisms and correlates of vaccine efficacy. A newlive-attenuated DENV vaccine currently is being tested in Brazil, one of the countries where DENV hasreached epidemic proportions. This TV003 vaccine formulation includes three attenuated strains correspondingto different DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4) and a fourth chimeric strain (DENV-2/DENV-4),which contains the DENV-2 structural genes and the DENV-4 non-structural genes. One of the majoradvantages of the TV003 vaccine relative to the Sanofi DENV-YFV vaccine is that all of its components arefrom DENV strains. A Phase II trial of this vaccine has been completed and a Phase III trial has been initiatedand will include over 17,000 subjects. Both phase II and III trials have been powered to include enoughsubjects to have training and test/validation cohorts. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, serum and plasmahave been collected on all subjects included in these two landmark studies. The major objective of our studywill be to compare, prioritize and select the best assay that predicts the immunogenicity and the efficacy of thisvaccine. We will test the hypothesis that several components (cellular, humoral and innate) are requiredto trigger the protection induced by this vaccine. The assays that will be tested here encompass a widearray of effector mechanisms of the cellular and humoral immune responses as well as novel genome-wideunbiased assessment of innate and adaptive immunity. A rigorous decision making tree will allow us in Aim 1to identify and validate assays that predict a vaccine triggered broad immune response that targets all fourDENV strains included in this vaccine. In Aim 2 we will identify the best in class assay(s) that predicts theefficacy of the vaccine in protecting recipients from infection. Efficacy will involve comparison of cases andcontrols if the vaccine's efficacy is below 80%; alternatively we will compare vaccinees and naturally infectedplacebos if the vaccine is highly efficacious (>85%). In Aim 3 our corporate partner Caprion, who has longstanding experience in developing predictors of clinical outcome, will further optimize and scale the assay(s)identified in Aim 1 (immunogenicity) and in Aim 2 (efficacy) for robustness, accuracy, and throughput requiredfor widespread clinical use in vaccine trials of DENV, and possibly other viruses.\",\n",
       " 'Vector borne viruses from different virus families account for many medically significant viral pathogens. More specifically, the vector borne flaviviruses, which belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, comprise some of the most important emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are generally transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. The mosquito borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV).  The dramatic and ongoing pandemic attributed to the MBFV Zika virus is a topic of considerable interest and significance because of its capacity to cause severe neurological defects including severe microcephaly and even fetal wastage in human fetuses. The public health implications of ZIKV are troubling.Our current research is focused on the TBFV, but studying the biology of TBFV will elucidate the biology of other vector borne viruses. The research in our laboratory employs virology, immunology, advanced imaging techniques, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology, and vector biology. We primarily study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that shares approximately 80% identity with TBEV at the amino acid level. LGTV can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. In addition, in the past year we are also studying the more virulent autochthonous BSL-3 POWV/DTV. Neither of these 2 agents are Select Agents which greatly facilitate research studies. In addition, we have also begun to study the BSL2 MBFV, Zika virus. With the recent emergence of Zika in Latin America and the US, similar avenues of inquiry are being explored for that vexatious pathogen. Comparison of VBFV cytoarchitecture in mammalian and tick cells. A key difference between TBFV infection of vertebrate and arthropod host systems is that infection of ticks is persistent and non-cytolytic, whereas infection of mammalian hosts is typically acute and cytopathic. We are investigating the nature of this difference to identify responsible host and viral factors. We previously published a study comparing LGTV virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography. Flavivirus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum. Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems. In contrast to mammalian cells, TBFV-infection in tick cells shows delayed and decreased membrane proliferation. Additionally, electron tomography of infected tick cells shows a shift from spherical vesicles to tubular profiles, especially in the context of persistently infected cells. In 2015, we continued these structural studies to cultures of mouse primary embryonic brain. LGTV infection was largely restricted to cells of neuronal origin, but glial cells also were infected. Ultrastructural studies revealed results similar to those observed in mammalian cell lines, although the frequency of the tubular profiles appeared greater than in permanent cell lines. Cellular structures associated with viral replication and virions were observed all along the processes of neurons, suggesting that these components are transported to actual nerve endings. The viral proteins and cellular partners responsible for the membrane rearrangements are a topic of interest in BVBV. Therefore, we have developed molecular clones expressing the nonstructural proteins, either singly or in clusters, that should prove suitable for evaluating the role of specific proteins in the rearrangement of the cellular membranes. It is hoped that the vector backbones should allow for good expression in both mammalian and tick cell lines. We have determined that expression in mammalian cells is higher using vectors with the chicken beta-actin promoter, and that Effectene is most efficacious transfection reagent. Results implicate that NS4a in the ER expansion and membrane rearrangement associated with TBFV infection. These studies were put on hold in order to begin work on Zika virus.This previous year, we initiated similar studies with ZIKV in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH) and mosquito cell lines (Aedes aegypti  CCL-125 and A. albopictus C6/36). ZIKV replicated well in SK-N-SH and C6/36, but failed to grow in CCL-125. ZIKV caused an acute lytic crisis accompanied by frank apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, but the effects of infection in C6/36 cells were imperceptible despite the fact that activated caspase 3 staining was readily apparent. These findings mirror those we have seen with the TBFV.The results of ultrastructural studies on SK-N-SH and C6/36 cells revealed that the cytoarchitecture of ZIKV infection was similar to that seen previously with the TBFV. However, the application of dual-tilt electron tomography lead to resolution substantially better than our previous work. Molecular biology and molecular pathogenesis of acute and persistent VBFV infection. Persistent infection plays a crucial role in natural life cycle of TBFV in rodent and arthropod hosts, and may also be responsible for prolonged debilitating sequelae observed in survivors of acute TBFV infection. However, this aspect of TBFV biology has been little studied. Experimental work by others on MBFV and the recent findings that ZIKV can persist in human semen and other sites for extended periods of time strongly imply that persistence of MBFV may also be an underappreciated feature of those infections.In the past year, we extended our study of TBFV persistence to inspect the cellular transcriptome during the initiation and maintenance of persistent infection.  As noted, LGTV infection causes an acute lytic crisis of most cells, and we have shown the mechanism of cell death is apoptosis. The surviving cells somehow evade apoptosis and go on to establish persistent infection. Our agnostic deep sequencing approach to the study of cellular transcriptomics confirmed that gene pathways associated with cell survival and apoptosis avoidance were involved. A signature of 451 genes was associated with the initiation of persistence. Intensive bioinformatics perusal using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and other similar software packages, revealed that networks associated with cell survival were playing a role. The acute phase was associated with networks and pathways.We also used our novel deep sequencing approach to examine the viral and cellular transcriptome during TBFV infection in tick cells (ISE-6). ISE-6 cells develop a persistent infection with no apparent acute phase. Although the cellular transcriptome analysis is still in progress, there is no evidence of DI genomes at any point. This is a substantial difference from mammalian cells, and has been submitted for publication.In other studies, we have initiated studies to identify cellular partners involved in egress of TBFV from infected mammalian and tick cells. This work capitalizes on proteomic work done by a current post-doctoral fellow in the lab. Peromyscus leucopus is the identified reservoir species for that autochthonous pathogenic POWV. We have begun experiments to characterize POWV/DTV infection in the P. leucopus mice. Both LGTV and POWV are severely restricted for growth in commerci',\n",
       " \"We are developing HIV pDNA based vaccine strategies both as preventive and therapeutic strategies. Attractive features of the pDNA platform lie in its simplicity, versatility, stability, with repeated administration without vector immunity, being a non-replicating vaccine and not association with adverse effects. There is a licensed pDNA vaccine against dog melanoma. Several pDNA vaccines are currently in clinical trials including against cancer. We are testing immunogenicity of SIV and HIV pDNA vaccines in mice and selected pDNA candidates are tested in the macaque model. Some of our successful candidates are now moving to clinical trials. This work is based on our previous recognition that RNA elements (called INS) present within the gag/pol and env coding regions of HIV are responsible for nuclear retention and instability of the transcripts in the absence of Rev, and that these elements can be eliminated by changing the nucleotide composition of the transcripts (RNA optimization; also referred to as codon optimization) without affecting the amino acid sequence. The immunogenicity of the antigens is further improved by modifying the trafficking of the antigens which is derived from our in-depth analysis of the molecular biology of the proteins. Because intramuscular injection of pDNA induces relatively low immune responses in macaques and humans, we are testing additional delivery methods, including in vivo electroporation, liposomes. We reported that electroporation dramatically increased the efficiency of DNA delivery in naive macaques, leading to greatly augmented antigen expression and resulting in the induction of highest levels of T cell responses. Our pDNA vaccine includes the cytokine IL-12 pDNA as adjuvant, increasing magnitude and quality of the responses. Importantly, we reported the dissemination of the pDNA vaccine induced T cell responses to mucosal sites including rectal and vaginal mucosa, the portal of entry of HIV. We also found that pDNA induced immune responses show extraordinary longevity in vaccinated macaques detectable for several years after the last vaccination. pDNA vaccination elicits moderate humoral immune responses in macaques. We showed that a protein boost can induce higher levels of Ab. We found that co-delivery of pDNA+protein either unadjuvanted or adjuvanted in the same muscle at the same time increased Ab production and mucosal dissemination. DNA+Protein co-immunization is superior to vaccination with either of the two individual components in eliciting humoral immune responses. Using pDNA-only vaccination, we found that our optimized DNA vaccine vectors are able to induce potent immune responses able to protect from high viremia. Combination of pDNA+Protein induces potent humoral responses able to significantly delay or prevent virus acquisition and improvement in virological control of the highly pathogenic SIV challenge. As in the RV144 trial, our vaccine regime induces responses to the V2 region that have been associated with delayed virus acquisition in humans. We are now exploring novel Env vaccination protocols and novel protein adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy. In a collaborative effort, we are testing the concept of combining vaccine against rubella and HIV. We focused on Gag as antigen, because Gag-specific T cell responses were reported to correlate with control of viremia in infected individuals and such responses are expected to reduce viremia in both preventive and therapeutic vaccination protocols. Vaccine regimens including rubella vector and SIV gag DNA in different prime-boost combinations resulted in robust long-lasting cellular responses with significant increase of cellular responses upon boost. Rubella vectors provide a potent platform for inducing HIV-specific immunity that can be combined with DNA in a prime-boost regimen to elicit durable cellular immunity. We continue to build on this vaccine platform. An ideal HIV vaccine should provide protection against all HIV-1 variants. Thus, an important aspect of HIV vaccine development is the selection of the immunogens, which has to take into consideration the diversity of the different HIV clades and the identification of the critical epitopes able to induce relevant immune responses, avoiding potential immunodominant  decoy  epitopes. Indeed, we reported a potent impact of Env on the induction of Gag cellular responses. To address these problems, we are exploring approaches to maximize immunological strength and breadth using mosaic and consensus molecules as well as focusing on highly conserved regions of HIV to induce immune responses to nearly invariable proteome segments, essential for the function of the virus, while excluding responses to variable and potentially immunodominant  decoy  epitopes. Using the latter, we have developed two distinct approaches focusing on conserved regions of HIV. (1) The HTI immunogen contains highly conserved regions of gag, pol, vif, and nef and includes optimally defined CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes restricted by a wide range of HLA class I and II molecules and covers viral sites where mutations led to a dramatic reduction in viral replicative fitness. In mice and macaques, immunization with DNA.HTI induced broad and balanced T-cell responses that were increased by a booster vaccination using MVA.HTI. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity of a novel T cell vaccine that induced broadly balanced responses to vulnerable sites of HIV while avoiding the induction of responses to potential decoy targets that may divert effective T-cell responses towards variable and less protective viral determinants. The DNA.HTI prime-HTI.MVA boost vaccine strategy is currently developed in Europe for a clinical trial. (2) We developed another prototype vaccine targeting highly conserved regions within the p24gag (p24CE DNA vaccine). Immunogens were engineered encoding conserved elements (CE) of HIV-1 selected on the basis of stringent conservation, functional importance, broad HLA-coverage, and association with viral control. In proof-of-concept studies in mice and macaques, we demonstrated that immunization with CE pDNA elicits robust cellular and humoral immune responses against CE, which cannot be achieved by p55gag DNA vaccination. This vaccine induces potent cytotoxic T cells responses targeting the Achilles' heel of the virus and induces robust immune responses to subdominant epitopes. Importantly, we demonstrated that priming with CE pDNA and boosting with p55gag pDNA greatly augment the CE-specific responses and that inclusion of the p24CE+gag pDNA in the boost maximizes both magnitude and breadth. We identified a novel and effective strategy to maximize responses against Gag and provide a novel strategy to shift the immunodominance hierarchy and to induce robust immune responses to subdominant epitopes. Translation of this novel vaccine concept is currently being pursued in an HVTN/DAIDS-supported clinical trial with the aim to test whether our p24CE pDNA vaccine concept elicits superior breath and magnitude of Gag responses compared to the optimized immunogen comprising the complete p55Gag protein. cGMP preparations of our pDNA molecules have been generated and tested for potency and immunogenicity. This vaccine includes IL-12 pDNA as molecular adjuvant and in vivo electroporation as pDNA delivery method, two vaccine components our research had shown to be of outmost importance to induce potent T cell responses in macaques. Thus, this trial will combine several of milestones (pDNA expression vectors, adjuvants and delivery) we have achieved over many years in vaccine development.\",\n",
       " '(1) To develop animal disease (end host) and persistence (reservoir host) models:Over the past years we have developed and characterized rodent and nonhuman primate disease models for infections with influenza A viruses, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra), and hantaviruses causing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS).  The two nonhuman primate MERS models, rhesus macaque and common marmoset, were further refined with a comparative pathology study. The results suggested that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection play a role in the severity of pulmonary pathology. We also investigated whether domestic pigs could be used as an alternative MERS model. Pigs were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose of MERS-CoV but did not develop signs of disease nor lesions in the respiratory tract. (studies ongoing)We have also further characterized the rhesus macaque HPS model to investigate mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. We are currently studying specific inflammatory events to gain understanding of what contributes to disease as well as to develop a therapeutic. Much of our work on hantaviruses in the past year was aimed at determining how the natural reservoirs are able to support high levels of virus replication without disease. We have previously shown that Sin Nombre virus elicits an initial inflammatory response in deer mice, the natural reservoir, but this response turned into an active anti-inflammatory response, as indicated by the activity of virus-specific T regulatory cells. Currently we are determining the requirement of these T regulatory cells to the suppression of the anti-inflammatory response by using T cell depletion strategies. (studies ongoing)We could demonstrate that Laguna negra infection causes HPS in Turkish hamsters. (finished and published) (2) To identify and characterize determinants of viral pathogenicity to develop antivirals:Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. In order to study a potentiating effect of co-infection we performed a study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 showed enhanced clinical disease. Similar studies were performed with a seasonal H3N2 virus and MRSA, in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement. Studies to decipher the mechanisms behind these observations were objectives over the past year and are still ongoing. (studies ongoing)Comorbidities are frequently reported in severe MERS cases. Thus, we tested the effect of immunosuppression on outcome of MERS-CoV infection in the rhesus macaque model. Immunosuppressed macaques did not develop more severe disease than immunocompetent animals, but they shed more virus, and viral loads in the lungs were significantly higher. Despite the increased virus replication, and in line with lack of increase in clinical disease, histological examination of the lungs showed a reduced inflammatory response in immunosuppressed macaques as compared to normal animals. These results suggested that the immune response to infection plays an important role in MERS-CoV pathogenesis. (studies ongoing)A novel henipavirus, Cedar paromyxovirus (CedPV) has not been associated with human disease. To elucidate mechanisms of disease induced by Nipah virus, we have used the hamster model of henipavirus disease to characterize and compare infection and pathogenesis. CedPV replicated in hamsters, yet did not cause any conspicuous pathology. In vitro studies suggest that CedPV elicits a strong innate immune response, whereas Nipah antagonizes this response, allowing for unchecked virus replication, resulting in massive cytopathology. These studies will continue and hopeful provide new insight into henipavirus pathogenesis that can be used to develop antivirals/therapeutics. (studies ongoing)(3) To identify and characterize host responses to viral infection to develop therapeutics:In collaboration with the Molecular Targets Program at NCI, griffithsin, a novel viral entry inhibitor, was identified as having potent (EC50 5nM) activity against MERS-CoV. The post-exposure efficacy of nebulized griffithsin in the rhesus macaque model showed moderate reduction of viral load but did not significantly reduce disease signs. We are currently refining the treatment scheme. We have also tested efficacy of three monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as a treatment for MERS-CoV infection in the common marmoset. These mAb had shown efficacy in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. Unfortunately, none of the mABs showed significant reduction in disease burden and viral lung load in the nonhuman primate model suggesting that treatment with mABs may likely not very efficacious. Confirmatory studies and treatment with mAB cocktails are either ongoing or planned.  Finally, we have tested the efficacy of the antiviral compound GS-5734 against MERS-CoV in the rhesus macaque model. Preliminary data indicate potent efficacy with reduction in disease burden and viral lung load. GS-5734 (Gilead) might be a promising treatment strategy for MERS. Confirmatory studies in the common marmoset model are planned.  (4) To develop protective vaccines:We continued with our efforts to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses. We currently are applying two approaches: i) expression of highly conserved B cell epitopes from two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk that have shown to afford heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region to increase antibody responses against otherwise poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector platform for these studies, which is able to induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody). Unfortunately, first attempts using the mouse model of influenza A viruses were rather discouraging. We will continue to optimize the CMV platform but have also started to use the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as an alternative platform. (studies are ongoing)For MERS, we have obtained very promising results with a DNA vaccine platform encoding a codon-optimized consensus spike protein. This vaccine candidate induced potent cellular immunity and antigen specific neutralizing antibodies in three animal species, mice, macaques and camels using a prime/boost/boost approach. Vaccinated macaques were protected against MERS-CoV challenge and did not show any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia. Recently, we were successful in shortening the vaccination strategy (prime/boost) for potential application of this vaccination approach in emergency situations to prevent MERS-CoV infection. (published and still ongoing) In an effort to generate an effective countermeasure for Nipah virus infection, we used the VSV based vaccine approach to express one of the glycoproteins of Nipah virus as an immunogen. These vaccines elicited strong antibody responses in hamsters and nonhuman primates and protected them from lethal, high dose Nipah virus challenge. We could demonstrate that not only is a strong neutralizing response elicited, but the vaccine primes the CD8+ T cell response as well. To investigate the limits of the efficacy of this vaccine, we used the hamster model and showed that this vaccine provides at least partial protection when given as late as on the day of virus challenge (DeBuysscher et al., NPJ Vaccines: accepte',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a life-threatening, NIH/NIAID category B human pathogen and a potential bioterrorism threat. Outbreaks of VEEV occur in Central America and have previously spread into the United States. The potentially devastating effects of the virus reemergence in the U.S. demand an effective vaccine to protect population. Currently, live attenuated TC-83 vaccine is used under IND protocol for vaccination of medical personnel at risk. The vaccine causes adverse effects, and efforts to develop an improved VEEV vaccine are underway. However, because vaccine development is a lengthy process and the supply of TC-83 vaccine is limited, the U.S. may soon experience a shortage of the VEEV vaccine. This can leave both the U.S. population and at-risk personnel unprotected. Furthermore, in the absence of vaccine, VEEV may require re-classification as a BSL4 Select Agent.  In Phase I SBIR, we developed a new technology for vaccination against VEEV and, potentially, other viral diseases. The proposed iDNA vaccination technology represents a unique combination of conventional DNA immunization with the high efficacy of live attenuated vaccines. The key feature of this technology is that live attenuated virus is launched in vivo from iDNA plasmid carrying a molecular clone of VEEV vaccine with enhanced safety and immunogenic features. In Phase I SBIR studies we have shown that injection in vivo of the prototype iDNA derived from the TC-83 vaccine has successfully launched live attenuated vaccine in mice. In this Phase II SBIR we propose advanced preclinical evaluation of iDNA VEEV vaccine based on the rational engineering of TC-83 clones and iDNA immunization technology.  In Sp. Aim 1, we propose (i) optimization of iDNA vaccination in vivo including iDNA formulation and the route of administration with, and without, electroporation, and (ii) dose escalation study to determine the minimal amount of iDNA sufficient to launch the vaccine virus and to induce protection in BALB/c mice. The iDNA will be formulated to minimize the need for electroporation and cold chain. In summary, the goal of Sp. Aim 1 is the development of patient- and doctor-friendly procedure for iDNA vaccination. In Sp. Aim 2, in collaboration with the University of Louisville, KY (UofL) we propose evaluation of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of experimental VEEV iDNA vaccines in mice, rabbits, as well as in rhesus non-human primates (NHP), which represent the best model for human VEEV infection. As a control, the standard TC-83 vaccine will be used. Following these studies, the lead VEEV iDNA vaccine will be selected for the cGMP production during Sp. Aim 3. In addition, we propose a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to seek input on the design of (i) GLP toxicology study and (ii) Phase I clinical trial.  Our preliminary data suggest that the rational vaccine design andiDNA technology can provide a revolutionary solution for VEEV vaccine by improving safety, genetic stability, and immunogenicity, and by eliminating many costly steps of the conventional manufacturing process. Essentially, live attenuated vaccine will be  manufactured  within the immunized individuals. This technology also utilizes many advantages of DNA vaccines (genetic homogeneity and stability, low cost of manufacturing, storage, and transportation, no cold chain) and, more importantly, enhances immunogenicity. As any recombinant DNA, the iDNA activates cGAS-cGAMP-STING-dependent signaling pathways resulting in robust production of cyto- and chemokines, which induce strong priming effects and stimulate acquired virus-specific immune responses. The final iDNA VEEV vaccine will represent a novel class of vaccines combining the advantages of DNA and live attenuated vaccines. The iDNA technology can be easily adapted for the development of other vaccines including live attenuated vaccines for WEEV, EEEV, other alphaviruses, and flaviviruses. If successful, this technology can potentially transform the field of live attenuated vaccines for many viral diseases.',\n",
       " 'ABSTRACT  Influenza virus is a serious public health threat. Seasonal outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality, and  pandemic  outbreaks  have  the  potential  for  widespread  infection  and  disease.  Novel pandemic viruses emerge from animal reservoirs to rapidly become the dominant circulating strains, as was the case during the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. Like all viruses, influenza virus is completely dependent upon the host cell for replication.  Influenza  virus  exploits  and  subverts  host  processes  while  at  the  same  time evading  cellular  antiviral  responses.  The  balance  between  these  pro-\\xad  and  antiviral  forces  influences  the outcome of a viral infection, yet we have limited knowledge on the host factors engaged during replication and how they impact disease severity and the emergence of new viruses. This information is required to define the molecular mechanisms underpinning a productive infection. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify host factors and their mechanisms that regulate influenza virus replication. We have generated data on a genome-wide scale identifying new host factors that impact infection. We specifically focused on events that occur after influenza virus enters the host cell. Results from our genome-wide knockout screen reveal that a large class of pro\\xad-apoptotic  and  innate  antiviral  factors,  including  IFIT2  and  IFIT3,  are  actually  important  enhancers  of influenza  virus  replication.  We  hypothesize  that  while  apoptosis  is  generally  seen  as  a  last-\\xadresort  antiviral defense, influenza virus has evolved to exploit the apoptotic cellular environment for maximal viral replication. In  Aim  1,  we  will  determine  the  impact  of  IFIT2  and  IFIT3  on  infection  and  define  the  functions  of  IFIT2  and apoptosis that promote viral replication. In Aim 2, we will use a newly developed technique to perform a virally driven  selection  of  host  modulators  and  use  sophisticated  network  analysis  to  identify  key  players  and pathways at the virus:host interface. We will then use the experimental strategies optimized in Aim 1 to define the mechanisms of these newly identified viral regulators. Major strengths of our strategy are that it can identify both pro- and antiviral co-factors and it is not restricted to influenza virus, but can be quickly adapted to study virus:host  interactions  in  almost  any  viral  system.  The results from this proposal will establish a mechanistic understanding of viral and host factors regulating infection. This detailed knowledge is essential for defining the molecular events that underpin a successful infection and identifying new targets that can be exploited for the rational development of antiviral therapies.',\n",

       " \"The host innate immune response is triggered within hours of virus infection. As a whole, its function is to limit virus replication at local sites of infection and to orchestrate development of the adaptive immune response. Viruses are typically recognized by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-like RNA helicases (RLHs). Ligation of these PRRs, often by viral nucleic acids, culminates in the activation of multiple transcription factors that cooperate in driving expression of cytokines and chemokines characteristic of the innate response. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) are particularly important transcription factors, responsible for induction of type I IFN (IFNalpha/beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and other mediators of inflammation. IFNalpha/beta is central to the anti-viral response as it initiates its own transcriptional program resulting in expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway.  ISG expression influences many cellular processes including RNA processing, protein stability and cell viability that can directly affect virus replication. ISG expression in cells of the immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages is critical for antigen presentation and T- and B-cell activation, thus affecting the quality of the adaptive immune response and eventual virus clearance. To facilitate dissemination, pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to suppress host innate immunity by antagonizing these signal transduction pathways. Hence, understanding the specific pathways by which viruses activate and evade innate immune responses is essential for understanding viral pathogenesis as well as for development of effective vaccines.   To examine virus-host interactions that affect innate immunity, our laboratory utilizes flaviviruses as the primary model of infection. Flaviviruses have an essentially global distribution and represent a tremendous disease burden to humans, causing millions of infections annually. The success of flaviviruses as human pathogens is associated with the fact that they are arthropod-borne, transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks. Significant members of this group include dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) that cause hemorrhagic fevers, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and most recently Zika virus (ZIKV) that cause infections of the central nervous system. These viruses are listed as NIAID category A, B and C pathogens for research into their basic biology and host response. The flavivirus single-stranded RNA genome is translated as one open reading frame; the resulting polyprotein is cleaved into at least ten proteins that include three structural (capsid C, membrane M, derived from the precursor preM and envelope E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). Virus replication proceeds in association with modified membranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum of host cells. NS5 is the largest and most conserved of the flavivirus proteins containing approximately 900 amino acids. It encodes a methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and associates with NS3 (the viral protease) to form the functional unit of the viral replication complex. Despite the widespread and often severe infections caused by these pathogens, vaccines exist for only a few (YFV, JEV and TBEV) and no therapeutic exists to treat clinical infection caused by any flavivirus.Type I IFNs are essential to recovery from flavivirus infection and have been used clinically as potential therapeutics, albeit with limit success. This may be due to the observation that all flaviviruses examined to date antagonize IFN-dependent responses by suppressing JAK-STAT signal transduction. We identified NS5 as the major IFN antagonist encoded by flaviviruses, originally using Langat virus (LGTV; a member of the TBEV complex of flaviviruses) and more recently using WNV. Although other NS proteins contribute to suppression of JAK-STAT signaling, studies by our laboratory and others suggest that NS5 is the most potent of the IFN antagonist proteins encoded by all vector-borne flaviviruses examined thus far.  Hence, determining the mechanism(s) by which NS5 impedes signaling is essential to understand flavivirus pathogenesis and may lead to new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the anti-viral effects of IFN by identifying the function of ISGs with anti-viral activity. Finally, it is essential to translate these findings to immunologically relevant cell types and animal models to understand the roles of induction and evasion of innate immunity in development of the adaptive immune response and in virus pathogenesis. Achieving these goals will significantly improve our understanding of how viruses emerge and cause disease in humans, as well as identify therapeutic targets for intervention.The major advance in our work this year was a collaboration with Dr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre's laboratory resulting in the identification of NS5 from Zika virus as an antagonist of type I IFN signaling. NS5 from Zika virus binds and degrades STAT2 from humans and non-human primates, but not mice, which may explain why mouse models of Zika virus infection have to be deficient in IFN signaling in order to observe disease. We also noted that the strategy of Zika virus NS5 to degrade STAT2 is similar to that of dengue virus but not its closer relative called Spondweni virus.However, unlike dengue virus, Zika virus did not utilize the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4 to induce degradation suggesting that there is another mechanism that is yet to be identified.\",\n",
       " 'Collaborations with Sanaria Inc and the Malaria Research and Training Center at the University of Bamako, Mali to conduct these PfSPZ related studies was initiated in 2012.PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali (NIAID Protocol 14-I-N010)Since January 2013, we have been preparing for a study to test the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against naturally occurring malaria infection of PfSPZ Vaccine in Malian adults. The phase 1 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of repeated IV immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali started in January 2014 in Doneguebougou, Mali at the Malaria Research and Training Center with complete enrollment into the study by February 2014. Twelve subjects were initially enrolled in a staggered manner for safety in the pilot safety group and received their first vaccination (1.35x105 PfSPZ Vaccine) the week of 28 January 2014, and then received 2.7x105 PfSPZ Vaccine two weeks later. 97 subjects were initially enrolled of which 96 subjects were stratified by village and randomized for the main group. Of those 96 subjects, 93 subjects (46 PfSPZ Vaccine; 47 placebo) received their first vaccination starting the week of 24 February 2014. The final vaccinations were received by 88 subjects (44 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 placebo) the week of 14 July 2014. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study started the week of 11 August 2014 (28 days following receipt of the fifth vaccination) and the final study visit was completed on 05 January 2014. Of the 88 subjects in the main group who received all five vaccinations, 86 subjects (42 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 placebo) completed the study through the transmission season to the last study visit88 healthy malaria exposed Malian adults (44 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 Placebo) received five doses of vaccine and 86 (42 PfSPZ Vaccine; 44 Placebo) were followed actively every two weeks for up to 24 weeks post vaccination #5. PfSPZ Vaccine was easy to administer, and was safe and well tolerated. P. falciparum infections 28 days post vaccination 5 occurred significantly earlier in the control group than the PfSPZ Vaccine group.PfSPZ Vaccine is safe, well tolerated, and is the first vaccine to show evidence of sterile protection to African adults from natural P. falciparum infection over the course of an entire malaria season.PfSPZ Vaccine in Mali, Africa  Dose Escalation (16-I-N004)Our initial results from Protocol 14-I-N010 have been encouraging given the following: 1) the protective efficacy was significantly higher than has ever been demonstrated by immunization with a malaria vaccine in adult Africans, 2) the PfSPZ Vaccine was efficacious against heterogeneous African P. falciparum parasites and 3) there was no evidence of waning of immunity during the 6 month follow up period. In addition, all doses were safe and well tolerated with little reactogenicity or adverse events reported. On the other hand, protection in both Tanzania and efficacy in Mali were lower than what was recorded in the USA, and it does not meet our expectations for a licensed PfSPZ Vaccine. One possible explanation for the lower rates of efficacy was provided by our assessment of antibody responses seen in Mali and Tanzania as noted above. These results clearly demonstrate that healthy Tanzanian and Malian adults do not produce comparable antibody responses to PfCSP after immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine to the non-Pf malaria-exposed adults in the U.S. Because adults play a significant role in transmission of P falciparum, and if PfSPZ Vaccine is to be used as a tool for elimination, it must be protective in adults. We think that the most likely explanation for the poor immunogenicity and protection in the adult Africans is immunoregulation due to lifelong exposure to P falciparum infections.Thus, we hypothesize that we can improve efficacy by increasing the number of PfSPZ Vaccine per dose, increasing the interval between the first and second doses to 8 weeks (as was done in WRAIR 2080 in the group receiving 3 doses of 4.5x105 PfSPZ), and reducing the number of doses to three. Additionally, we hypothesize that we can learn how the standard CHMI model may be used in the field and start to explore the impact such factors as malaria co-infection and drug treatment have on vaccine responses.PfSPZ CVac-PYR (NIAID Protocol 15-I-0169)As previously noted, a human study suggested that anti-infection immunity might be achieved with a much smaller parasite inoculum. This method of immunization by experimental P. falciparum infection in conjunction with antimalarial prophylaxis is referred to as chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS), infection treatment vaccine (ITV), and chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CVac) by different authors. We use the term CVac in this Protocol to refer to this vaccine concept.Since chloroquine is a blood-stage schizonticide, the degree to which the protective immune response induced by the chloroquine CVac model targets liver or blood-stage antigens is unclear from the study of Roestenberg et al. Further, limited data in both animal and humans indicate that exposure to blood-stage parasites may abrogate liver-stage immune responses. It is important to further define whether sterile protective immunity to P. falciparum can be induced by wild-type (non-attenuated) sporozoite immunizations when exposure is limited to sporozoite and pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle and by a low dose of sporozoite inoculum. This study will evaluate a CVac regimen using chloroquine weekly in addition to pyrimethamine. This combination will attempt to prevent the development asexual erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite.By completely preventing the release of blood-stage parasites, this CVac regimen will extend the findings of Roestenberg et al. and explore whether highly protective anti-infection immunity and sterile protection from homologous P. falciparum challenge can be induced by exposure that is limited to the liver-stage of parasite development. Exploration of stage-specific immune responses involved in protective immunity to P. falciparum and discovery of new target antigens is critical for future development of malaria vaccine strategies.The intervention in this study is induction of stage specific immunity (pre-erythrocytic immunity) to malaria following direct venous inoculation (DVI) with aseptic, purified, vialed, cryopreserved, fully infectious NF54 PfSPZ (referred to as Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge) produced by Sanaria, Inc when exposure is limited to the SPZ and liver-stages of the parasite life cycle and at a low dose PfSPZ inoculum (51,200 Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge) via the following regimens: PfSPZ Challenge under chloroquine coverage or PfSPZ Challenge under chloroquine and pyrimethamine coverage for a total of 3 exposures while subjects are under one or two malaria prophylaxis regimens listed above. Protective efficacy will be assessed by homologous CHMI via PfSPZ Challenge via DVI.',\n",
       " 'RSV vaccine:The primary goal is to identify, in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, a live-attenuated strain of RSV suitable for further development as a pediatric RSV vaccine, to be given by intranasal administration. We previously showed that deletion of the ORF encoding the small (90 amino acids) viral M2-2 protein results in down-regulated viral RNA replication (causing viral attenuation) and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. We recently evaluated a prototype virus bearing this mutation, called RSV MEDI/delM2-2, in a phase 1 clinical trial with clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health (JHU; NCT01459198). In seronegative children, compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the delM2-2- virus was significantly more restricted for shedding in nasal washes but induced significantly higher titers of RSV neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.In the present review period, we completed a phase 1 clinical trial of a second delM2-2-based candidate, called RSV LID/M2-2. This was performed in 29 seronegative children 6-24 months of age (20 vaccine recipients and 9 placebo controls; NCT02040831 and NCT02237209). This study was done in collaboration with JHU plus the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network. Unexpectedly, this virus was substantially less restricted than MEDI/delM2-2; the basis for this is presently being investigated. This virus also was more immunogenic. There was no evidence of increased respiratory tract illness in vaccine versus placebo recipients except that one vaccinee had brief, mild LRT illness. This was concurrent with the shedding of vaccine virus as well as enterovirus/rhinovirus. Therefore, causality was unclear. Surveillance during the following RSV season showed that 8 vaccinees had strong boosts in RSV-neutralizing serum antibody titers but without medically-attended RSV disease, indicating strong anamnestic responses to wt RSV without illness. These results confirmed that the delM2-2 mutation is associated with increased immunogenicity, apparent protection, and very strong amnestic responses. RSV LID/delM2-2 may be insufficiently attenuated. It is possible that a delM2-2 mutant with replication properties intermediate between the MEDI and LID viruses would be optimal. To this end, we presently are evaluating 2 additional delM2-2 viruses in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, namely RSV D46/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02601612) and LID/delM2-2/1030s (NCT02794870).The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above, which was a previous lead candidate, contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive, but exhibits genetic instability involving at least 2 attenuating point mutations in the L protein called 248 and 1030. We previously developed new versions of these 2 mutations that were modified for increased genetic stability. A version of the rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus was created that incorporated these stabilized mutations, resulting in a virus called RSV cps2. This virus was evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (34 vaccinees and 17 placebo recipients; NCT01852266 and NCT01968083), in collaboration with JHU and IMPAACT. Without going into detail, this showed that this virus indeed is less immunogenic than the delM2-2-based viruses noted above (which had been evaluated approximately in parallel), and thus this particular backbone will not be further developed at this time. However, sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus from vaccinees indicated an absence of de-attenuation at the attenuating mutation 248 or 1030, indicating that substantial stabilization of these mutations indeed had been achieved. These stabilized attenuating mutations presently are being used in other vaccine candidates (such as LID/delM2-2/1030s noted above).We also are evaluating another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2del1313. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains deletion of codon 1313 in the polymerase L protein. This virus is being evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial (NCT01893554) presently in progress.Thus, we have several promising RSV platforms in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials. Our goal is to perform a number of small phase 1 studies in 2016, 2017, and possibly 2018 to identify a lead candidate and a back-up candidate to bring forward to larger studies.Wild type (wt) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of wt RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. In collaboration with the Medical Virology Section, this virus presently is being evaluated in an in-patient setting for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers in a dose-escalation study (NCT02484417). This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate anti-RSV drug candidates and adult RSV vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) that includes mutations that were engineered for genetic stability. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics.HPIV2 vaccine: We previously developed an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724 that includes stabilized mutations. This virus presently is being evaluated in a phase 1 trial in seropositive children 15 to 59 months of age, which will be followed by evaluation in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437).HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. This provides a benchmark for pre-clinical comparison with other existing vaccine candidates to identify ones that are less attenuated.These were the first live-attenuated HPIV1, 2, and HMPV vaccines to be evaluated in humans.',\n",
       " 'Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies directly bind the virus and prevent its entry into host cells, providing narrow immunity from reinfection by closely related strains. CD8 T cell responses to IAV generated against highly conserved viral proteins/epitopes contribute to clearance of virus during primary IAV infection and also confer broad heterosubtypic protection in animal models. Recent evidence links the cross-reactive CD8 T cell response in man to reduced viral replication and protection from severe illness in pandemic H1N1 infections in European populations, and H7N9 infections in China. Because pre-existing T-cell immunity, independent of baseline antibodies, protects against symptoms and viral shedding associated with influenza, influenza vaccines that stimulate broadly reactive CD8 T cell responses may have the capacity to protect against any pandemic influenza A virus. Human infections with H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAV and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have spurred an interest in the development of vaccines against IAV with pandemic potential. Major challenges to this effort include our inability to predict which virus will emerge and rapid production and deployment of vaccine if the virus spreads rapidly and vaccine yield is not optimal. In addition, the number of doses of vaccine required depends on whether the population is immunologically naive. Therefore, vaccine technologies that elicit broadly cross-reactive and protective immune responses against a range of influenza viruses and that can be scaled-up are desirable. We compared the efficacy of two intranasally delivered non-replicating vaccines (H1 and H5 S-FLU) that are based on the suppression of the hemagglutinin signal sequence, with the corresponding H1N1 and H5N1 cold-adapted (ca) live attenuated influenza vaccines in mice and ferrets.  Administration of two doses of H1 or H5 S-FLU vaccines protected mice and ferrets from lethal challenge with homologous, heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza viruses and two doses of S-FLU and ca vaccines were comparable. Importantly, when ferrets vaccinated with one dose of H1 S-FLU or ca vaccine were challenged with the homologous H1N1 virus, the challenge virus failed to transmit to naive ferrets by the airborne route. S-FLU technology can be rapidly applied to any emerging influenza virus and the promising preclinical data support further evaluation in humans.',\n",
       " \"(A) Study pathogenesis and pathophysiology of high biocontainment viral pathogens utilizing molecular technologies including reverse genetics systems: Bunyaviruses: We are currently in the process of establishing the first nonhuman primate model for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF) utilizing Cynomolgus macaques. The model will be extremely valuable for pathogenesis studies and countermeasure development. (studies ongoing) Filoviruses: The Syrian hamster model for Ebola virus infection displays almost all hallmark features of human disease. Using this model, we have investigated the mechanisms in which hamsters are protected from wild-type Ebola virus infection and determined that a CD4+ T cell response, facilitating a neutralizing antibody response, is responsible for natural immunity. (studies ongoing)We continued to utilize the Collaborative Cross (CC), a panel of reproducible, recombinant inbred strains spanning the genetic breadth of three murine subspecies, to identify host factors important for Ebola virus disease progression. Transcriptomics revealed that the host responses dependent on genetic background determine susceptibility to infection independent of virus replication. (studies ongoing)We have studied the virulence of several Ebola-Makona isolates from the West African epidemic in macaque models and could show that these isolates are slightly attenuated compared to the Ebola-Mayinga prototype strain. More interesting, these new isolates did not cause lethal infection in the IFNR-/- mouse model, an established rodent model for non-rodent-adapted Ebola isolates.  We have started to utilize humanized mice to study Ebola virus pathogenesis and immune responses. (studies ongoing)(B) Study immune responses to infection and vaccination of high containment viral pathogens and develop new vaccine candidates:Arenaviruses: We continued a project focused on the elimination of Lassa virus from the reservoir species, Mastomys natalensis. For this, we used two vaccine platforms, a recombinant attenuated strain of Salmonella and a recombinant cytomegalovirus vector, to immunize the peri-domestic reservoir with the hope to block Lassa virus transmission among rodents and to humans. (studies ongoing)Bunyaviruses: We have continued to characterize and optimize the adenovirus based vaccine for CCHF. Ongoing transfer and depletion studies using the adenovirus-based vaccines expressing the CCHF nucleoprotein or glycoproteins indicated that antibodies are the mechanism of protection. We also developed VSV-based vaccine vectors. Efficacy testing in the mouse model has shown that the glycoprotein itself is insufficient to protect animals. Filoviruses: The VSV vaccine efforts are reported under the 'Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine' project. In the meantime, we have proceeded with the development of alternative vaccine candidates for filoviruses. One approach is targeted towards wildlife vaccination, in particular the great apes, using the concept of a disseminating vaccine vector. The idea is the introduction of a recombinant CMV expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Proof-of-concept studies have been successful in the mouse and rhesus macaque model using a murine and rhesus CMV vector, respectively.  WE have also continued to investigate a vaccine based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing filovirus-like particles; initial rodent and nonhuman primate studies have revealed very promising results.  (C) Study vector/reservoir transmission of high containment viral pathogens using appropriate animal models:Arenaviruses: We have studied infection kinetics of different Lassa virus in the Mastomys reservoir utilizing a unique colony established here at RML. The animals support virus replication and shedding for several weeks before Lassa virus gets cleared. The model will allow for important transmission studies. (studies ongoing)(D) Utilize in vitro and in vivo systems to study the interactions between viral pathogen or viral components and host cells and develop new antiviral strategies: Arenaviruses: Previously we had tested the efficacy of two antivirals, T-705 and ribavirin, in the guinea pig model of Lassa virus infection. In particular, T-705 showed promise as a treatment for Lassa virus with protection even when treatment was started post-disease onset.  More recently, we were able to demonstrate efficacy of T-705 against Lassa infection in the nonhuman primate model. (studies ongoing)Filoviruses: Ribavirin can effectively extend the time-to-death of hamsters infected with Ebola virus, but resistance will rapidly develop. Surprisingly, T-705 protected hamsters against Ebola virus infection when animals were treated for two weeks beginning the day after infection. This promising treatment option is currently being followed up. We have also identified a few promising broad spectrum antivirals against Ebola virus, which are in development as treatment options for other RNA viruses. Further confirmation is underway. In contrast, treatment with anti-malaria drugs, including chloroquine, failed in Ebola rodent models and should not be further considered. (studies ongoing)(E) Study the epidemiology and ecology of high biocontainment pathogens utilizing newly developed rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic test systems including those that can be applied under field conditions:Filoviruses: From August 2014 through May 2015 we have operated a diagnostic laboratory in Monrovia, Liberia to support the international response to the West African Ebola epidemic. We have started to analyze data for scientific purposes under approved protocols. So far we have demonstrated the importance of performing on-line clinical chemistry and malaria differential diagnostics. Most importantly, we have identified the interesting observation that plasmodium co-infection increases the survival rate of Ebola-infected patients. Future studies will be designed to test this observation in animal models and to understand the underlying mechanism.\",\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent virus infections cause disease in hundreds of millions of people and exert constant strain on the global economy due to healthcare costs. While progress has been made towards understanding mechanisms that allow viruses to persist, therapies to control persistent viruses are not optimal due an incomplete understanding of the factors involved in virus persistence. One common theme that accompanies virus persistence is an exhaustive or hypo-responsive state of adaptive immune response. This phenomenon was first described using the staple animal model for studying virus persistence, Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), in its natural mouse host and extended to human persistent infections. Using this model, it was revealed that a balance between positive and negative immune regulatory molecules is essential to purge virus infection. One of the most extensively studied mechanisms contributing to virus persistence has been T cell exhaustion, which is potentiated by negative immune regulatory molecules such as IL-10 and PD-1. Interestingly, the absence of two positive immune regulatory molecules, IL-6 and IL-21, result in the inability to control persistent virus infection. These molecules are known to be important for B cell function. However, studies on whether B cells also control persistent virus infection have been neglected and their role remains unknown. A newly discovered member of the IL-6 family, IL-27, modulates both B and T cell responses during infection. However, few studies have examined how IL-27 affects antiviral immune responses. I began studying how IL-27 deletion affects the outcome of both acute and persistent LCMV infection. I made the observation that IL-27-deficiency resulted in prolonged LCMV clone-13 persistence. Prolonged virus persistence in IL-27-/- mice correlated with defects in both T and B cell responses. Virus specific T cells in IL-27-/- mice displayed exacerbated T cell exhaustion following clone-13 infection. Moreover, I discovered that IL- 27-/- mice made elevated levels of IgG1 with minimal production of IgG2a, compared to predominant production of IgG2a in IL-27+/+ hosts. I further demonstrated that development of plasma B cells (the major antibody producers) and anti-LCMV IgG production is required to control clone-13 infection, indicating that antibody likely plays an important role in controlling persistent virus infection. This grant proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which IL-27-deficiency leads to prolonged LCMV persistence. The aims are focused on understanding how IL-27 contributes to altered antiviral T and B cell responses and whether IL-27 signaling on T or B cells is essential to purge persistent LCMV infection. The absence of IgG2a production during persistent virus infection in IL-27-deficient mice suggests that IL-27- dependent induction of IgG2a may be essential to control persistent virus infection. The possibility that a specific antibody isotype may be essential to purge persistent virus infection i novel and will be investigated within this proposal.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic viral infection mediates premature T cell aging and vaccine failure through regulation of microRNA-regulated proteins, with an aim to develop effective approaches to improve vaccine efficacy in virus-infected individuals. To this end, we will use a model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine failure i the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The proposal is based on the fact that co-infection of HBV with HCV is common due to shared risk factors, and as such HBV vaccine is required to prevent super-infection and its associated increase in morbidity and mortality; however, vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals are often blunted. This phenomenon is also observed in the elderly who frequently fail to respond to vaccinations; and attempts to improve the rate of immunizations in both infected and aged populations have been unsuccessful, in part due to our poor understanding of the mechanisms that inhibit vaccine responses in these settings. In studying the effect of chronic viral infection on T cell functions,we and others have recently found that chronic HCV infection leads to T cell dysfunction mediated through up-regulation of aging markers, including killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) and dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), concomitant with a decline of microRNA-155 (miR155) levels in CD4 T cells. Remarkably, these alterations are associated with impaired CD4 T cell functions in HCV- infected individuals and are more prominent in HBV vaccine non-responders (HBV-NR) compared to age- matched HBV vaccine responders (HBV-R). It has been demonstrated that with increasing age, KLRG1 is up- regulated and leads to inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling; whereas DUSP6 is increased and leads to recalibration of the TCR activation threshold; and miR155 decline is known to permit translation of a set of target genes related to T cell inhibition. However, the mechanisms underlying miR155/KLRG1/DUSP6 expression and regulation of premature T cell aging and vaccine responses during HCV infection remain unknown. In this proposal, we hypothesize that HCV-induced loss of miR155 mediates premature T cell aging by up-regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expressions, such that targeting these inhibitory pathways may rescue impaired CD4 T cell functions and subsequently boost blunted vaccine responses in virus-infected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the following two specific aims: Aim 1 will define the transcriptional and translational mechanisms that control miR155 expression and the role of miR155 in regulating KLRG1 and/or DUSP6 expression in T cells during HCV infection; Aim 2 will examine the consequences of miR155 loss and KLRG1/DUSP6 over-expression in T cell function and vaccine response in virus-infected individuals. This translational study is significant in that it provides a working model to explore mechanisms that may be fundamental to diminished vaccine responses in general, particularly in the setting of immunocompromise by HIV, hemodialysis, transplantation, and cancer.',\n",

Vector fields appear in many science and engineering applications. Traditional vector field visualization research focuses on the trajectory of flow particles, i.e., their movement. This research formulates a visualization framework that provides additional information on fundamental flow particle motions including volumetric expansion and contraction, rotation, and angular deformation. These motions have physical significance for many phenomena, such as compressibility of the fluids, flow separation, rate of fluid mixing, circular currents (e.g., eddies, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.) and energy dissipation. Effective visualization and analysis of dynamic complex physical will enable improved industrial processes, energy conservation, weather modeling, prediction and warnings. Students involved in the research project will gain knowledge in computer science, scientific visualization, differential geometry, abstract algebra, and algebraic topology and their research experience will include working with collaborators from other science and engineering disciplinesThe aim of this project is to develop foundations for analysis of 3D asymmetric tensor fields, and incorporate it into a multi-field framework for vector field visualization. This project will lead to understanding the topological and geometric structures of 3D asymmetric tensor fields by leveraging knowledge from vector field analysis and symmetric tensor field analysis as well as applying and enhancing results from tensor calculus, different geometry, algebraic topology, and dynamical systems. To extract topological features reliably from asymmetric tensor fields, mathematical formulations of these features will form the basis for curve and surface extraction techniques. Research on effective 3D asymmetric tensor field visualization techniques will explore and enhance 3D symmetric tensor field visualization techniques as well as 2D asymmetric tensor field visualization methods. Novel visualization techniques will be developed for multi-field visualization for both a vector field and its gradient tensor field by extending multi-field visualization techniques from scalar and vector fields. Research results will be tested on data from a range of applications, including fluid and solid mechanics, long-term climatology, and seismology.

Each year, the REU program will provide ten or eleven students from around the United States an opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students work closely with a faculty mentor  on a ten-week research project in a variety of physics subfields. The projects span the subfields of astrophysics, biophysics, complex systems, condensed matter, nuclear and particle physics.  Examples include developing new photomultipliers for dark matter searches, analyzing spectroscopic data to learn about the molecules present in distant planet-forming regions, designing new proteins with useful energy storage properties, and exploring strongly correlated materials through nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition to their specific research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty, graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-related work in diverse settings -- students will visit facilities such as the McClellan Nuclear Research Center, Lick Observatory, and the Advanced Light Source. Former UC Davis REU students now working in the San Francisco Bay Area will also describe their career paths to current participants. At the end of the program, each participant gives a formal research presentation and presents a written project report that can lead to a peer reviewed publication. Taken as a whole, the REU activities teach skills useful for further scientific endeavors, give students a broad perspective on possible future paths, and help them build a network of professional contacts.

       " \"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research and education in predicting candidate materials for gas separation. Solar water splitting is a renewable energy source that could be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In solar water splitting, sunlight energy is captured by turning water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that generates only water when burned. In this project, the PI and his team of student researchers will use computational modeling to predict high performance membrane materials for separating the gaseous products of solar water splitting. The PI's approach may lead to more efficient and lower cost hydrogen producing devices for energy applications.Membrane materials will also be predicted for the application to purify helium from naturally occurring gases. Helium is traditionally purified by liquefying it at extremely cold temperatures, but enormous energy is required to cool to these temperatures. The PI's team will develop computational methods to search a recently published database of metal-organic framework materials to identify molecule sieves having pore sizes and other characteristics suitable for helium purification. They will further develop computational methods to model gas separations in membranes made from these materials. This should reduce energy requirements during helium purification, by allowing part of the gas purification to be performed at moderate temperatures. The computational methods developed in this project will be made publically available in software tools developed by the PI's group.Educational activities are an important part of this project. The PI will train graduate and undergraduate students in computational materials science methods. Graduate students will perform doctoral dissertation research extending the capabilities of computational methods. The PI and graduate students will develop YouTube videos explaining computational materials science at levels appropriate to K to 12 and undergraduate students and the general public. They will also prepare training modules to be disseminated through Nanohub.org and that explain computational materials science techniques to graduate students and professionals. The PI and graduate students will perform outreach to middle and high school students by being science fair judges. Students from under-represented groups will be involved in the project. TECHNICAL SUMMARYThis CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research and education in predicting candidate materials for gas separation. The PI and students will research strategies to automatically parameterize flexible, polarizable force-fields from quantum chemistry calculations. These force-fields will be used in classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of metal-organic frameworks to compute gas diffusion constants and adsorption isotherms. A database of experimentally known metal-organic framework crystal structures will be screened to identify metal-organic framework-based materials suitable for purifying (a) helium from naturally occurring gas sources and (b) hydrogen gas from solar water splitting. Cryogenic distillation is currently the primary helium purification method. Using helium-selective membranes instead for all or portions of this purification could dramatically reduce energy requirements. Solar water splitting is an environmentally friendly and renewable hydrogen gas source. Wireless solar water splitting uses particles immersed in liquid to cogenerate a hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture with trace water vapor. Wireless solar water splitting could offer higher gas generation rates per volume than wired solar water splitting containing distinct anode and cathode compartments. This project will enable more widespread use of wireless solar water splitting (and wired solar water splitting with small anode-cathode gap distance) by identifying suitable metal-oxide framework-based materials for hydrogen-oxygen-water gas separations. Because constructing mechanically robust membranes from pure metal-oxide framework crystals is difficult, the PI will aim to predict easier-to-fabricate mixed matrix membranes containing metal-oxide framework crystals embedded in mechanically robust polymers. Prior metal-oxide framework studies showed framework flexibility that sometimes impacts gas diffusion constants by orders of magnitude. The key scientific challenge is to develop computationally efficient, automated methods to construct accurate flexible force-fields. To achieve this, the PI's research team will combine (1) the Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical method for computing net atomic charges and other atomic properties with (2) a modification of Tkatchenko-Scheffler self-consistent dispersion screening to compute polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients with (3) a modification of the quick force-field (QuickFF) method for computing flexibility parameters. By computing system-specific force-field parameters, this approach should achieve higher accuracy than generic force-fields. The computational methods developed in this project will be made publically available in software tools developed by the PI's group.Educational activities are an important part of this project. The PI will train graduate and undergraduate students in computational materials science methods. Graduate students will perform doctoral dissertation research extending the capabilities of computational methods.

       " 'Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus of global public health concern due to its ability to cause severe congenital abnormalities that include microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, fetal demise, and congenital eye (ocular) pathology.  Ocular manifestations of ZIKV infection in congenitally infected humans include chorioretinal atrophy, optic nerve abnormalities, bilateral iris colobomas, intraretinal hemorrhages, and lens subluxation.  ZIKV infection of the testes and semen likely facilitates sexual transmission of the virus.  The goal of this proposal is to establish and characterize the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and persistence in immune privileged sanctuary sites (e.g., the eyes, ovaries, and testes).  The proposed studies will test the contribution of (1) TAM receptors as candidate ZIKV entry receptors in immune privileged sanctuary sites and (2) the role of adaptive immunity in clearance of ZIKV from target organs.Analogous to Dengue virus (DENV), a closely related flavivirus, ZIKV does not replicate efficiently in adult wild-type (WT) mice, most likely due in part to the fact that ZIKV and DENV antagonize human but not mouse STAT2.  Since signaling through the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (Ifnar1) leads to activation of STAT2, it became necessary to study mice with impaired or absent Ifnar1 signaling in order to establish mouse models of ZIKV pathogenesis.  Mice treated with antibodies to the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (Ifnar1) are more vulnerable to viral replication but do not succumb to infection.  Since ZIKV can be transmitted sexually, prior studies tested ZIKV infection of testes and found that ZIKV replicates preferentially within the testes of adult Ifnar1-/- animals.  ZIKV infection of immune privileged organs (e.g., testes, ovaries, and eye) may result in viral persistence, as was recently observed in the aqueous humor of a patient who developed uveitis after infection with ZIKV.  Preliminary experiments have found high levels of persistent ZIKV RNA in the eyes, testes, and ovaries of adult anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated WT mice at least 28 days after infection.We hypothesize that longstanding infection of immune privileged organs may lead to irreversible tissue damage in mouse models of ZIKV pathogenesis, which may have long-term impact on the function of these organs.  Previously published in vitro studies have demonstrated that TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, Mertk) are required for ZIKV infection in cell lines, but whether these virus attachment/entry receptors are physiologically relevant remains to be tested in vivo.  We hypothesize that ZIKV utilizes TAM receptors to infect immune privileged organs and that the adaptive immune response acts to clear the virus from these infected sanctuary sites.  These proposed studies will enhance our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis and will provide a foundation for studies to test potential therapies.  Key questions to be addressed by the proposed studies include:  (1) Do TAM receptors function as ZIKV attachment/entry factors in the eye, testes, and ovaries in vivo?  (2) How long does ZIKV persist in immune privileged sanctuary sites (e.g., testes, ovaries, eye) in WT and TAM receptor-deficient mice?  (3) How long does ZIKV persist in immune privileged sanctuary sites (e.g., eye, testes, ovaries) in WT and Rag1-/- mice?  (4) What are the contributions of T and B cells to clearance of ZIKV from the serum, eye, testes, and ovaries?Aim 1:  Define mechanisms of ZIKV infection of immune privileged sanctuary sites.  In this aim, we propose to characterize the course of ZIKV infection in the serum, eyes, testes, and ovaries of WT, Axl-/-, Mertk-/-, Tyro3-/-, and Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 antibodies to facilitate ZIKV pathogenesis in mice.  Serum, eyes, testes, and ovaries of infected WT and knockout adult animals will be evaluated histologically and virologically on days 7, 28, 56, and 84 after infection.  We will examine ZIKV tropism in the target organs by immunostaining and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  We will determine whether the eyes, testes, and ovaries sustain irreversible damage and whether TAM receptor-deficiency is protective.  We anticipate that mice lacking TAM receptors may be more resistant to infection of immune privileged target organs, since TAM receptors have been demonstrated to function as ZIKV receptors in cell culture and are highly expressed in the testes, ovaries, eye, and brain.Aim 2:  Define the role of the adaptive immune response in clearance of ZIKV from immune privileged target organs.  Preliminary findings indicate that ZIKV infects and persists in immune privileged target organs of mice, although there appears to be a gradual reduction in viral titer over time.  We propose to test the role of T and B cells in clearance of ZIKV from immune privileged sites including the eye.  To examine the contribution of T and B cells in the clearance of ZIKV from immune privileged sanctuary sites, WT, MT-/-, TCR -/-, and Rag1-/- mice will be infected with ZIKV and viremia as well as titers in target organs will be monitored on days 7, 28, 56, and 84 after infection.  Additionally, we will study the contribution of T and B cells to clearance of ZIKV from immune privileged sites by performing adoptive transfer of T cells (or passive transfer of immune serum) from infected WT animals into Rag1-/- mice.  After transfer of T cells or immune serum into Rag1-/- mice, we will monitor viral titers over time to determine whether the adaptive immune response facilitates clearance of ZIKV from immune privileged sanctuary sites (e.g., eye, testes, ovaries).  As a complementary approach, we will test contribution of T cells to clearance of ZIKV from the eyes, testes, and ovaries by depleting T cells at defined time points after infection.',\n",

Current vaccines offer no protection against an emerging pandemic virus, and it can take up to 6 months before a matched pandemic vaccine can be produced.  This creates an incumbent need for universal influenza vaccines with a high level of protection (>90%) against circulating strains that also can protect against emerging pandemic virus.FluGen has developed and started clinical testing of a new vaccine designed to meet the need for a universal influenza vaccine.  The M2-deficient Single Replication (M2SR) vaccine carries a mutation that results in no M2 protein production by the virus.  As a result, no viral progeny are produced by M2SR after an initial (single-round) infection with no subsequent cell-to-cell spread or virus shedding.  Testing in animal models has shown that M2SR can protect against drifted and shifted virus challenge, the properties sought in a universal influenza vaccine.  The clinical studies proposed in this application will evaluate the protection offered by the M2SR vaccine in a human challenge model for influenza infection.These proposed clinical studies primarily address the Fiscal Year 2016 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program Area of Encouragement for Influenza, “Development and testing of a universal influenza vaccine.”  Secondarily, analysis of these clinical studies will shed light on an additional Area of Encouragement, “Research to improve understanding of host responses to influenza infection.”The objectives of the proposed clinical studies are to demonstrate that the M2SR vaccine has properties of a universal influenza vaccine using a human influenza challenge model and to use study sample test results to identify potential correlates of protection for universal influenza vaccines.  There are three aims associated with these objectives: (1) challenge of M2SR (H3N2) vaccinated subjects with a drifted H3N2 virus; (2) challenge M2SR (H3N2) vaccinated subjects with a heterologous H1N1 virus; and (3) immune analysis of clinical samples from Aim 1 and 2 studies to identify correlates of protection.Two Phase 2 studies with a very similar design are planned to accomplish these aims.  Only volunteers that are seronegative for the M2SR vaccine and the challenge virus will be enrolled.  Each study has been powered appropriately so that a vaccine effect on influenza disease mediation can be detected.  For the drifted H3N2 study, 46 subjects will be used and 23 of the subjects will be vaccinated intranasally with an M2SR (H3N2) vaccine.  For the heterologous H1N1 study, 96 subjects will be used and 48 of the subjects will be vaccinated intranasally with an M2SR (H3N2) vaccine.  Subjects will be housed in a secure clinical facility in groups of 20 (10 vaccinated, 10 control), inoculated with either H3N2 or H1N1 challenge virus, and monitored over an 8-day quarantine period for signs and symptoms of influenza infection.  Nasal washes will be analyzed for viral shedding using qPCR assay and infectivity assays.  Clinical samples from both clinical studies will be evaluated for serum antibody responses, T cell responses, and mucosal responses to influenza antigens to narrow down the immune responses that were elicited by the vaccine and responses that were recalled upon exposure to the challenge virus to help identify immune correlates.This project will demonstrate that the M2SR vaccine has the properties of a universal influenza vaccine and identify correlates of protection to support future clinical development towards M2SR licensure.  The development of a universal influenza vaccine like M2SR will reduce influenza morbidity and mortality.  This will have a significant public health and military impact.  Influenza infections among military personnel are known to impact Department of Defense readiness here and abroad.  Vaccination with a universal M2SR vaccine would help maintain military readiness by protecting military personnel from both seasonal and pandemic strains.  Finally, influenza complications are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, like retired military Veterans.  A more effective vaccine with broader coverage could provide substantial benefits for the retired military population served by the Department of Veterans Affairs as well.',\n",
       " 'The immune responses to Pneumocystis are poorly understood, but cytokines may play a role in both clearing Pneumocystis infection and in the hypoxia associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia that may be exacerbated following initiation of therapy.  We are using immunodeficient mouse models, especially the CD40L KO mouse, as well as immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice to further evaluate the role of individual cytokines and other immunoregulatory molecules in modulating Pneumocystis infection.  We have developed a real time PCR assay to quantitate Pneumocystis over a wide dynamic range, and are currently examining Pneumocystis infection in healthy animals to better understand immune responses in the normal host.  Using microarrays, we have been able to identify genes that are differentially expressed during Pneumocystis infection in healthy compared to immunodeficient mice; the majority of differentially expressed genes are related to the immune system.  Immunohistochemical studies of the lungs done in parallel have demonstrated that there is an influx of CD4 cells and macrophages at 5 weeks, and, surprisingly, an influx of B cells at 6 weeks in immunocompetent mice but not CD40L KO mice.  Microarray studies suggest that the B cells persist through at least 10 weeks, well after the infection has been cleared.We have extended these studies to examine immune responses in other immunodeficient mice, including those with defective innate immune responses, such as Myd88 knockout mice which are deficient in TLR signals, and CDld KO mice, which lack NKT cells.  Our studies have shown that these mice are not susceptible to uncontrolled Pneumocystis infection, suggesting that neither TLR signaling, nor NKT cells are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with Philip Murphy, Michail Lionakis, and their groups, we have examined changes in expression of a variety of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, using Taqman real-time PCR assays, and have been able to identify CCR2 and its ligands as potentially important in the response to Pneumocystis infection.  However, in examining the susceptibility of CCR2 knock-out mice to Pneumocystis infection, we found that they are able to clear infection similar to wild-type animals.  We also examined CX3CR1 knock-out mice for susceptibility to Pneumocystis infection, since CX3CR1 and its ligand identify alternately activated macrophages and are critical to clearance of another fungus, Candida, in mouse models.  These mice were again able to clear Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice.  Using microarray analysis of purified CD4 cells isolated from lungs of Pneumocystis-infected mice, we were able to show that CXCR6 is preferentially upregulated compared to cells from uninfected animals, and by Q-PCR that both CXCR6 and its ligand, CXCL16, are unregulated in lung tissue from immunocompetent Pneumocystis-infected mice. We are currently examining the role of CXCR6 in controlling Pneumocystis infection through use of CXCR6 knock-out mice. We are examining the kinetics of immune responses in the lung of healthy animals exposed to Pneumocystis, using flow cytometry. We have found that interferon-gamma, and less predictably, IL-17, expression are increased in lymphocytes of the lung, primarily CD4 cells, during Pneumocystis infection and clearance, suggesting that Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cells may play a role in clearing infection. Immunodeficient CD40L KO mice did not show changes in either of these populations during Pneumocystis infection. In follow-up, we found that IL-17A knockout mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, thus demonstrating that IL-17 is not critical to control of Pneumocystis infection. We have extended these studies to demonstrate that Th2 and Treg cells show minimal changes in in the lung during Pneumocystis infection in healthy mice, and that an anti-interferon-gamma antibody administered to immunocompetent mice causes a shift from Th1 to Th17 responses, but does not impact control of infection., with kinetics of clearance that are similar to untreated controls. We have recently examined the contribution of beta-glucans in cysts to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We have demonstrated that, similar to other pathogenic fungi, glucans are to a large extent masked by surface proteins in 3 Pneumocystis species (P. murina, P. carinii, and P. jirovecii). Moreover, we have shown, by comparing infected mice treated with caspofungin, an inhibitor of beta 1,3 glucan synthase, to untreated mice, that beta-glucans are major contributors to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.We are also examining the response of dendritic cells to the most abundant Pneumocystis antigens, the major surface glycoprotein (MSG).  Finally, we are performing reconstitution studies in CD40KO mice, to try to identify which cells are critical to the mounting an effective immune response against Pneumocystis.  For these studies we use CD45 allelic variants as donors to allow us to track transferred cells.  We have been able to show that unfractionated spleen cells from immunocompetent mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, and are currently examining which subpopulations of cells can confer this protection. Preliminary studies suggest that B cells play an important role in conferring long-lasting protection.  We are further examining the role of B cells by performing immune reconstitution studies using B cells that are quasi-monoclonal, to help determine if antibody production or, alternatively, other properties of B cells, such as antigen presentation, are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  It is hoped that these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms critical for control of Pneumocystis infection in the healthy host, and may provide mechanisms for increasing clearance of Pneumocystis or decreasing the inflammation that may be causing hypoxia.',\n",
       " 'This project conducts clinical trials of live intranasal pediatric vaccine candidates for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV1, 2, and 3), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with RSV being the most important vaccine target.RSV vaccine:The primary goal is to identify, in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials, one or more live-attenuated strains of RSV suitable for further development as a pediatric RSV vaccine, to be given by intranasal administration. We previously showed that deletion of the ORF encoding the small (90 amino acids) viral M2-2 protein (delM2-2) results in down-regulated viral RNA replication (causing viral attenuation) and up-regulated viral gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of increased immunogenicity. We have been evaluating several versions of delM2-2 viruses phase 1 clinical trials in RSV-seronegative children 6-24 months of age. First, a prototype virus called RSV MEDI/delM2-2 was evaluated with clinical collaborators at Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health (JHU; Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01459198). This showed that this virus was very highly attenuated for replication, and possibly was more attenuated than necessary. Nonetheless, compared to our previous lead RSV vaccine candidate, called rA2cp248/404/1030delSH, the MEDI/delM2-2 virus induced significantly higher titers of RSV-neutralizing serum antibodies. Thus, it indeed appeared to have increased immunogenicity per infectious unit. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.A second delM2-2-based candidate, called RSV LID/M2-2, was evaluated in a similar phase 1 study by JHU plus the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network (NCT02040831 and NCT02237209). Unexpectedly, the LID/delM2-2 virus was substantially less restricted than MEDI/delM2-2 and was deemed to be insufficiently attenuated. The basis for the difference in replication by these two viruses is presently being investigated. The LID/delM2-2 virus was more immunogenic than MEDI/delM2-2, presumably due to the increased replication. There was no evidence of increased respiratory tract illness in vaccine versus placebo recipients except that one vaccinee had brief, mild LRT illness. This was concurrent with the shedding of vaccine virus as well as enterovirus/rhinovirus. Therefore, causality was unclear. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season provided presumptive evidence of protection and strong anamnestic antibody responses.Several other versions of RSV delM2-2 viruses presently are under evaluation in similar phase 1 trials, namely RSV D46/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02601612), RSV LID/delM2-2/1030s (NCT02794870 and NCT0252339), RSV LID/cp/delM2-2 (NCT02890381 and NCT02948127), and RSV D46/NS2/N/delM2-2 (NCT03099291 and NCT03102034). Ideally, we would like to identify a delM2-2 mutant with replication properties intermediate between the MEDI/delM2-2 and LID/delM2-2 viruses, with the idea that it would be desirable to have as much replication as is safe in order to enhance immunogenicity.The rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus mentioned above, which was a previous lead candidate, contains a series of point mutations and deletion of the SH gene, and is highly temperature-sensitive. However, in a previous phase 1 clinical trial in seronegative infants and children 6-24 months of age, it exhibited genetic instability that primarily involved two attenuating point mutations in the L protein called 248 and 1030. We previously developed new versions of these two mutations that were modified for increased genetic stability (called 248s and 1030s). A version of the rA2cp248/404/1030delSH virus was created that incorporated these stabilized mutations, resulting in a virus called RSV cps2. This virus has now been evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial in seronegative children 6-24 months of age (NCT01852266 and NCT01968083), in collaboration with JHU and IMPAACT. Consistent with the results from its parent, this virus was highly attenuated but was less immunogenic than the delM2-2-based viruses noted above. Sequence analysis of shed vaccine virus from vaccinees indicated an absence of de-attenuation at the stabilized attenuating mutations 248s or 1030s, indicating that substantial stabilization of these mutations indeed had been achieved. Thus, the cps-2 virus is a feasible vaccine candidate, although at the present time we are focusing on viruses like the delM2-2 viruses that may be more effective. The stabilized 1030 mutation presently is being used in other vaccine candidates (such as LID/delM2-2/1030s noted above).We are evaluating another RSV vaccine candidate called RSV delNS2/del1313/I1314L. This virus contains the deletion of the nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) gene, whose encoded protein antagonizes host responses to viral infection, notably the type I interferon (IFN) response. It also contains a stabilized mutation in the polymerase L protein that we previously developed, and which consists of deletion of codon 1313 combined with a I1314L missense mutation. This virus is being evaluated in a phase 1 pediatric clinical trial (NCT01893554) presently in progress.Thus, we have several promising RSV candidates in phase 1 pediatric clinical trials. Our goal is to identify two lead candidates to bring forward to larger studies in 2018.Wild type (wt) RSV:We prepared a clinical trial lot of wt RSV strain A2 produced from cDNA. This provides a virus with a well-defined passage history and reduced possibility of adventitious agents. In collaboration with the Medical Virology Section, this virus presently is being evaluated in an in-patient setting for infectivity, replication, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in healthy adult volunteers in a dose-escalation study (NCT02484417). This will provide an infection model that can be used to evaluate anti-RSV drug candidates and adult RSV vaccine candidates, and to study viral pathogenesis and the host response.HPIV1 vaccine: We previously developed and evaluated an HPIV1 vaccine candidate called rHPIV1-C(R84G/del170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A), which includes stabilized mutations, in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT00641017) and showed that it is over-attenuated. Over-attenuation can be corrected by reverse genetics.HPIV2 vaccine: We developed and are evaluating an HPIV2 vaccine candidate called rHPIV2-V94(15C)/948L/1724, which includes stabilized mutations, in seronegative children 6 to 59 months of age (NCT01139437).HMPV vaccine: We previously developed an HMPV vaccine virus called rHMPV-Pa in which the HMPV P gene was replaced by that of avian MPV, thus conferring a host range attenuation phenotype. A phase 1 trial in seronegative children 6-59 months of age (NCT01255410) showed that this virus is over-attenuated. This provides a benchmark for pre-clinical comparison with other existing vaccine candidates to identify ones that are less attenuated.These were the first live-attenuated HPIV1, 2, and HMPV vaccines to be evaluated in humans.',\n",

       " \"(A) Study pathogenesis and pathophysiology of high biocontainment viral pathogens utilizing molecular technologies including reverse genetics systems: A major achievement of the past fiscal year is the establishment and characterization of the first nonhuman primate disease model for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF). Utilizing the Hoti strain, Cynomolgus macaques do develop moderate to severe disease that is fatal in approximately 20% of the animals upon a combination of subcutaneous and intravenous inoculation. Disease progression is very like human disease with most hallmark signs being displayed. The model will be extremely valuable for pathogenesis studies and countermeasure development. Further characterization such as a serial sacrifice study is ongoing. (manuscript submitted) We further studied the pathogenicity of multiple Ebola virus, strain Makona, isolates. The study was initiated after in vitro reports that Makona accumulated mutations in the glycoprotein gene that were associated with adaptation to humans during the West African Ebola epidemic. Due to our involvement in Liberia and Mali we have a unique set of Ebola-Makona isolates covering a larger portion of this outbreak. We tested different isolates displaying or lacking the questionable mutations utilizing a mouse and the rhesus macaque model. Surprisingly, all isolates behaved very similarly independent of the genotype, causing severe or lethal disease in mice and macaques, respectively. Likewise, we could not detect any evidence for differences in virus shedding. Thus, no specific biological phenotype could be associated with these EBOV-Makona mutations in vivo.  (manuscript under review)We have continued to utilize humanized mice to study ebolavirus pathogenesis and immune responses. To investigate differences in viral pathogenicity, humanized mice (hu-NSG-SGM3) were inoculated with Ebola virus (EBOV, causes fatal human disease) or Reston virus (RESTV, does not cause disease in humans). Consistent with differences in disease in human infection, pronounced weight loss and markers of hepatic damage and disease were observed exclusively in EBOV-infected mice. These abnormalities were associated with significantly higher EBOV replication in the liver but not in the spleen, suggesting that efficiency of viral replication in select tissues early in infection may contribute to differences in viral pathogenicity. (manuscript under revision; studies ongoing)(B) Study immune responses to infection and vaccination of high containment viral pathogens and develop new vaccine candidates:The VSV vaccine efforts are reported under the 'Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine' project. In the meantime, we have proceeded with the development of alternative vaccine candidates for filoviruses. One approach is targeted towards wildlife vaccination, in particular the great apes, using the concept of a disseminating vaccine vector. The idea is the introduction of a recombinant CMV expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Proof-of-concept studies have been successful in the mouse and rhesus macaque model using a murine and rhesus CMV vector, respectively.  We have also continued to investigate a vaccine based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing filovirus-like particles; initial rodent and nonhuman primate studies have revealed very promising results. (manuscript in preparation; studies ongoing)(C) Study vector/reservoir transmission of high containment viral pathogens using appropriate animal models:We have studied infection kinetics of different Lassa virus in the Mastomys reservoir utilizing a unique colony established here at RML. The animals support virus replication and shedding for several weeks before Lassa virus gets cleared. The model will allow for important transmission studies. (manuscript in preparation; studies ongoing)(D) Utilize in vitro and in vivo systems to study the interactions between viral pathogen or viral components and host cells and develop new antiviral strategies: Previously we had tested the efficacy of two antivirals, T-705 and ribavirin, in the guinea pig model of Lassa virus infection. T-705 showed promise as a treatment for Lassa virus with protection even when treatment was started post-disease onset.  This year, we could demonstrate efficacy of T-705 against Lassa infection in the nonhuman primate model. (manuscript in revision)(E) Study the epidemiology and ecology of high biocontainment pathogens utilizing newly developed rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic test systems including those that can be applied under field conditions:From August 2014 through May 2015 we have operated a diagnostic laboratory in Monrovia, Liberia to support the international response to the West African Ebola epidemic. We have continued to analyze data and demonstrated the importance of performing on-line clinical chemistry and malaria differential diagnostics. Most importantly, we have identified the interesting observation that plasmodium co-infection increases the survival rate of Ebola-infected patients. We have started animal studies (mouse model) to better understand the underlying mechanism. (study ongoing)\",\n",
       " 'The major obstacle of basic and antiviral research in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the lack of readily accessible, physiological cell culture systems permissive for viral infection and replication. Here we describe a highly physiological HBV infection model by using human hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells. Differentiated HLCs present key features of mature hepatocytes. Notably, the expression of viral receptor sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is more stable in HLCs than in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). HLCs support a robust and productive HBV infection that can be manipulated either by siRNA down-regulation of certain host factors involved in HBV replication or antiviral treatment. Unlike other in vitro models, HLCs support HBV spreading. By using this model, we identified two host-targeting agents, Genistin and PA452, as novel antivirals against HBV infection. HLC is a superior model for antiviral testing than NTCP over-expressing hepatoma cell lines. Genistin shows antiviral activities only in HLCs and PHHs but not in HepG2-NTCP or Huh7-NTCP cells. This novel HBV infection HLCs model offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of molecular details of the HBV life cycle, to further characterize virus-host interactions and to define new targets for HBV curative treatment.While the innate immune responses are generally the first line of defense against invading pathogens, it is controversial whether HBV replicates without activating the innate immunity or actively inhibits the innate pathways in the hepatocytes. To address this question, we used various hepatocyte culture models including hepatoma cell lines expressing viral receptor-NTCP, stem cell-derived hepatocytes and primary human hepatocytes. Using either transfection of HBV genome-containing plasmids or infection by infectious cell culture-generated HBV or patient-derived virus in human hepatoma cell lines and primary or stem cell-derived human hepatocytes, we have established various cell culture models of HBV infection and replication. Despite a robust HBV replication, no interferons (IFNs) or IFN-stimulated genes were induced. Using primary human hepatocyte engrafted SCID/uPA mice, HBV infection was established in vivo. At the peak of viremia, no induction of human IFN could be detected in the liver. These observations indicate a lack of innate immunity in terms of interferon response in HBV infected hepatocytes. To study if HBV actively inhibits innate immune sensing, poly IC and Sendai virus, known to be potent inducers of interferon response, were tested in hepatocyte culture that were infected with HBV. Both type I and III IFNs as well as IFN-stimulated genes were strongly induced by the poly IC or Sendai virus. But concurrent HBV infection did not affect the magnitude nor breadth of this response. Confocal microscopy at single cell level further confirmed that HBV infected hepatocytes exhibited strong nuclear IRF3 and STAT1 expression after Sendai virus infection, similar to that of non-infected cells. Since HCV is known to induce a robust interferon response in infected hepatocytes, we also examined the interferon response in the HBV/ HCV co-infection setting. We co-infected HBV and HCV in primary human hepatocytes and studied their replication and the interferon response. We observed that HBV did not alter HCV replication nor down-regulate the well-known induction of interferon response by HCV, as compared to the HCV mono-infection. HBV infection generates both viral DNA and RNA during propagation, which could be detected by various PRRs. We thus characterized expression and functions of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different hepatic cell models. We showed that hepatocytes are deficient in DNA sensing machinery, which likely contributes to the lack of IFN response in HBV infected hepatocytes. These findings support the notion that HBV does not actively interfere with the innate sensing mechanism of the hepatocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that HBV behaves like a stealth virus and is not sensed by the innate immunity of the infected hepatocytes, potentially explaining the propensity of HBV to chronic infection.The lack of interplay between HBV infection and hepatocytes innate immunity raises the intriguing question of how HBV eventually activates adaptive immunity of infected host. To partly address this question, we studied the response of macrophages to HBV. We showed that HBV is capable of activating macrophages to produce various cytokines at high viral titers, which may mark the initial step of an HBV-specific immune response, potentially explaining the long window period during acute infection and HBVs propensity to chronic infection.',\n",
       " 'The mosquito-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and are the cause of yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and West Nile fever syndromes. In recent years, much of our laboratory effort was focused on the development and preclinical testing of dengue virus vaccine candidates suitable for inclusion in a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. Clinical lots of each of these vaccine candidates were manufactured in prior years and have been evaluated individually in Phase I clinical trials, and several tetravalent vaccine admixtures have also recently been evaluated in human subjects. Optimal tetravalent admixtures have been selected and have now entered Phase II and III evaluation. Although the dengue virus vaccine program is predominantly in a clinical mode at this time, considerable effort is currently devoted to support a number of important functions, including, 1) manufacture, replacement, maintenance, stability/sterility analysis, and distribution of clinical lots of vaccines suitable for study in human subjects, 2) basic research on virus stabilization and lyophilization processes, 3) submission and laboratory support of IND applications for the clinical evaluation of tetravalent dengue vaccine formulations, 4) support of the seven companies/institutions that have licensed our vaccine technology or virus products, which includes consultative visits and clinical trial planning, development of manufacturing processes, preparation and shipping of vaccine seed or clinical lot viruses, assistance with sequence analysis, and sharing of IND/clinical trial data, 5) support of collaborations with investigators interested in basic virology or immunology studies, 6) use of immune cells collected from our clinical studies to investigate the innate immune response to vaccination, 7) development of antigenic cartography methods for the analysis of antibody responses to dengue virus, and 8) characterization of epitopes recognized following dengue or Zika virus infection.With the emergence of Zika virus in the Western hemisphere and the recent public health emergency, our attention has been strongly focused on the development of live attenuated vaccine candidates that would be compatible for co-formulation with our tetravalent dengue vaccine.  Recombinant chimeric viruses expressing the prM and E proteins of Zika virus on either the DENV-2 or DENV-4 background have been generated and evaluated successfully in rhesus monkeys.  Manufacture of these vaccine candidates to create clinical lot materials is underway at Charles River Laboratories.  In addition, serum from Zika patients in Latin America has been received and used to isolate Zika virus strains for use in developing the human challenge model.  A strain from Nicaragua and a strain from Brazil have been fully sequenced, safely evaluated in rhesus monkeys, and have been produced and released as clinical trial materials.Mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes the most important viral encephalitis in the Asia Pacific region, accounting for more than 20,000 reported cases and 6,000 deaths annually. Efforts to develop a JEV vaccine continue in our laboratory and it is envisioned that a suitable live attenuated JEV vaccine could be combined with our live attenuated DEN virus vaccine to create a second-generation pentavalent vaccine for the control of these viruses in Southeast Asia. The laboratory has recovered numerous engineered viruses and has evaluated their pathogenicity in mice. The recombinant rJEV virus remains fully virulent in mice and provides a background for the evaluation of attenuating mutations. Sets of mutations derived from the attenuated SA14-14-2 vaccine virus produced in China have been introduced into the rJEV virus clone in order to evaluate the attenuating potential of mutations found in both the structural and non-structural genes. Following evaluation in mice, a number of these recombinant viruses look suitable for evaluation in non-human primates and consideration as vaccine candidates.',\n",
       " 'Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies directly bind the virus and prevent its entry into host cells, providing narrow immunity from reinfection by closely related strains. CD8 T cell responses to IAV generated against highly conserved viral proteins/epitopes contribute to clearance of virus during primary IAV infection and also confer broad heterosubtypic protection in animal models. Recent evidence links the cross-reactive CD8 T cell response in man to reduced viral replication and protection from severe illness in pandemic H1N1 infections in European populations, and H7N9 infections in China. Because pre-existing T-cell immunity, independent of baseline antibodies, protects against symptoms and viral shedding associated with influenza, influenza vaccines that stimulate broadly reactive CD8 T cell responses may have the capacity to protect against any pandemic influenza A virus. Human infections with H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAV and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic have spurred an interest in the development of vaccines against IAV with pandemic potential. Major challenges to this effort include our inability to predict which virus will emerge and rapid production and deployment of vaccine if the virus spreads rapidly and vaccine yield is not optimal. In addition, the number of doses of vaccine required depends on whether the population is immunologically naive. Under a collaborative research and development agreement with MedImmune, we have previously developed pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines (pLAIV) against clade 1 H5N1 viruses on an Ann Arbor cold-adapted (ca) backbone and demonstrated that they induce long-term immune memory. In 2015, an increased number of human infections caused by a new clade (2.2.1.1) of goose/Guangdong (gs/GD) lineage H5N1 viruses were reported in Egypt that would require updating of the H5N1 pLAIV. We explored two strategies to generate suitable pLAIVs. The first was to modify the hemagglutinin gene of a highly pathogenic wild-type (wt) clade 2.2.1.1 virus A/Egypt/N03434/2009 (Egy/09) (H5N1) and include its unmodified neuraminidase (NA) gene; this virus was designated Egy/09 ca.  The second approach was to select a low pathogenicity avian influenza H5 virus that elicited antibodies that cross-reacted with a broad range of H5 viruses including the Egypt H5N1 viruses and contained a novel NA gene in order to avoid potential restriction of replication of the vaccine virus by pre-existing anti-NA antibody in the human population.  We selected the low pathogenicity A/duck/Hokkaido/69/2000 (H5N3) virus (dk/Hok/00) for this purpose. Both candidate vaccines were attenuated and immunogenic in ferrets.  The vaccines induced antibodies that neutralized homologous and heterologous H5 viruses with different degrees of cross-reactivity; Egy/09 ca vaccine antisera were more specific to the gs/GD lineage viruses but did not neutralize recent North American isolates (clade 2.3.4.4), whereas antisera from dk/Hok/69 ca vaccinated ferrets cross-reacted with clade 2.3.4.4 and 2.2.1 viruses but not clade 1 or 2.1 viruses.   When vaccinated ferrets were challenged with homologous and heterologous H5 viruses, replication of challenge viruses were reduced in the nasal turbinates and lungs. Thus, we developed two H5 pLAIV candidates that are suitable for clinical development to protect humans from infection with different clades of H5 viruses.An outbreak of avian origin H10N7 influenza was reported among seals in Northern Europe and two fatal human infections with an avian H10N8 virus in China demonstrated that H10 viruses can spread between mammals and cause severe disease in humans. To gain insight into the potential for H10 viruses to cross the species barrier and identify a candidate vaccine strain, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo properties and antibody response in ferrets to 20 diverse H10 viruses. H10 virus infection of ferrets caused variable weight loss and all 20 viruses replicated throughout the respiratory tract; however, replication in the lungs was highly variable. In glycan-binding assays, the H10 viruses preferentially bound avian-like 2,3-linked sialic acids. Importantly, several isolates also displayed strong binding to long-chain human-like 2,6-linked sialic acids, and exhibited comparable or elevated neuraminidase activity relative to human H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 viruses.  In hemagglutination inhibition assays, 12 antisera cross-reacted with  14 of 20 H10 viruses, and 7 viruses induced neutralizing activity against  15 of the 20 viruses.  By combining data on weight loss, viral replication, and the cross-reactive antibody response, we identified A/mallard/Portugal/79906/2009 (H10N7) as a suitable virus for vaccine development. Collectively, our findings suggest that H10 viruses may continue to sporadically infect humans and other mammals, underscoring the importance of developing an H10 vaccine for pandemic preparedness.Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have received attention as a treatment option for a variety of infections, including influenza.  When a novel influenza A virus emerges, the subtype of the infecting virus may not be known early in clinical presentation.  Thus, a MAb that is active against a broad range of influenza subtypes would be invaluable for treatment and prophylaxis.  Additionally, treatment strategies capable of interrupting the spread of influenza through sustained human-to-human transmission would limit the public health burden during a pandemic response.  MEDI8852 is a novel MAb developed by MedImmune, which neutralizes both group I and group II influenza A viruses (IAV) in vitro.  Under a cooperative research and development agreement with MedImmune, we evaluated the efficacy of MEDI8852 as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent against representative group I and II avian influenza A viruses with pandemic potential, in mouse and ferret models.  We also assessed the ability of MEDI8852 to block transmission of influenza H1N1pdm09 in a ferret model. We showed that MEDI8852 was effective for prophylaxis and treatment of H7N9 and H5N1 infection in mice, with a clear dose-dependent response and treatment with MEDI8852 24, 48 or 72 h post-infection (hpi) was superior to oseltamivir for H5N1.  MEDI8852 alone was effective treatment for lethal H5N1 infection in ferrets compared to oseltamivir and R347 and MEDI8852 plus oseltamivir was better than oseltamivir alone.  MEDI8852 or oseltamivir alone early in infection were equally effective for H7N9 infection in ferrets while the combination yielded similar protection when treatment was delayed.  MEDI8852 was able to protect nave ferrets from airborne transmission of H1N1pdm09.',\n",

       " \"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen in the world, causing serious complications on women's reproductive health including ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. C. trachomatis also causes infection of the eye resulting in inflammation and in some cases blindness. The objectives of this project are to define the epidemiology, risk factors, transmission kinetics, and pathogenesis of C. trachomatis infections in different population settings, including populations in resource constrained countries. We have used the Internet site www.iwantthekit.org since 2004 to offer sampling in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Alaska for chlamydia screening in over 7,500 women and over 4,000 men using self-obtained vaginal swabs, penile-meatal swabs and rectal samples. Samples were also tested for gonorrhea and trichomonas. Prevalence of chlamydia for women overall was 6.8% and 7.7% in men. Both young age and Black race have been statistically associated with chlamydia positivity. Trichomonas prevalence in women was 6.1% and 2.2% in men. For rectal chlamydia in men, the overall chlamydia prevalence was 6.9% while for gonorrhea it was 4.0%. Acceptance for self-collecting penile-meatal and rectal swabs has been very high. Rectal chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence in women was 6.3% and 0.9%, respectively. In 2004 chlamydia prevalence was 10.0% which has declined to 3.2% in 2017, an indication of a successful public health program. To study the capability for performing a point-of-care self-test for trichomonas at home, we recently enrolled 102 women who performed the mailed point-of-care (POC) trichomonas test successfully at home. The test demonstrated high accuracy and high acceptability. Recently, as part of a consented-on-line study, 120 persons have requested and performed a POC HIV oral fluid test at home, with excellent satisfaction survey results. The IWTK website has over 10,000 page views per month. Plans are to add home collection of dried blood spots for syphilis and HIV testing which could make IWTK useful for PREP monitoring for STIs.Trachoma due to C. trachomatis infection is the most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. The WHO has recommended that three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with antibiotics be offered to control the disease in districts where the prevalence of follicular trachoma (TF) is >10% in children aged 1-9 years, with treatment coverage of at least 80%. We have conducted both surgical and antibiotic treatment intervention studies in Gambia, Niger, and Tanzania in efforts to control trachoma. However, the source of infection following mass treatment is often unknown. If migrants into a village undergoing MDA are shown to impede progress towards elimination, then a local strategy that addresses treatment of new families and a nationwide strategy that addresses migration will be needed. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of migrants on the prevalence of infection and clinical trachoma in communities. In four communities in Kongwa, Tanzania, all children were enrolled in a longitudinal study of infection and trachoma. New children were identified at census updates as having not been in the community at the previous census. Within communities, neighborhoods were defined as spatially close groups of households. Children who were migrants were more likely to be infected and to have trachoma than children who were resident in the community, which was significant by the time of the survey following the third year of MDA (odds ratio, OR, 2.49, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.036.05). The neighborhoods where newcomers resided were more likely to have infection a year later than neighborhoods with no migrants, which was most pronounced following the third year of MDA (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.077.65). In summary, migrants to communities may be an important source of re-emergent infection, especially as MDA lowers infection among residents.We therefore conducted a community-randomized, clinical trial to determine if a surveillance program that targeted newcomers and travelers, identified weekly, would result in more communities achieving levels of infection of 1%. 52 communities were randomly allocated 1:1 to the control (annual mass drug administration with azithromycin (MDA) alone if warranted) or intervention arm (annual MDA if warranted, plus a surveillance program to identify and treat newcomers and travelers). In each community, surveys were completed every six months on a random sample of 100 children ages 1-9 years for trachoma and infection. The primary outcome was the proportion of communities in the intervention arm, compared to the control arm, which had a prevalence of infection at 1% by 24 months. Intervention communities experienced an average of 110 surveillance events per month. At 24 months, 7 (27%) of 26 intervention communities achieved a prevalence of infection 1% compared to 4 (15%) of the 26 control communities (odds ratio = 26, 95%CI = 056-119). At 24 months, the average infection prevalence in the intervention communities was 48, compared to 69 in the control communities (p = 06). Despite surveillance programs for community newcomers and travelers, the proportion of intervention communities with a level of infection 1% was lower than expected and not significantly different from control communitiesRecent work on a test for antibodies to C. trachomatis pgp3 antigens suggests serology is a promising tool that indicates cumulative risk of exposure to C. trachomatis. In a trachoma-endemic district in Tanzania that stopped its program four years ago, we undertook a surveillance survey, adding to the assessment of TF a lab test for C. trachomatis infection, and a dried blood spot which was processed for antibodies to C. trachomatis antigen pgp3; antibody status may indicate cumulative past exposure to infection. The prevalence of TF was 0.4%, below the 5% cut-off indicating that trachoma elimination had been achieved with no re-emergence. The antibody positivity overall was low, 7.5%, and increased with age from 5.2% in 13 year olds, to 9.3% in 79 year olds (p = 0.015). In 16 of the 30 hamlets, no children aged 13 years old had antibodies to pgp3. The antibody status of the 13 year olds indicated low cumulative exposure to infection during the surveillance period. In summary, four years post -program, there is no evidence for re-emergence of trachoma using any indicator sufficient to indicate re-emergence.\",\n",
       " '1.  Bivalent vaccines that confer protection against rabies and other virusesWe have been developing a rabies virus based vaccine that expresses the glycoprotein (GP) from ebolavirus, marburgvirus and sudanvirus, the GPC from lassa virus, and the Spike protein from MERS-CoV.  Previously we developed (a) replication-competent, (b) replication-deficient, and (c) chemically inactivated rabies virus (RABV) vaccines expressing Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) using a reverse genetics system based on the SAD B19 RABV wildlife vaccine in collaboration with Matthias Schnell of Thomas Jefferson University. Immunization with live or inactivated RABV vaccines expressing EBOV GP induced cellular and humoral immunity against each virus and conferred protection from both lethal RABV and EBOV challenge in mice. We have continued our evaluation of the RABV based EBOV vaccine and have found that an adjuvant improves efficacy of the inactivated vaccine in rhesus and cynomolgus macaque challenge models. A clinical trial lot of the rabies-ebolavirus has been produced and evaluated in NHPs.  The Marburg-rabies construct has demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy in mice.  Efficacy in the nonhuman primate model of Marburg virus is being pursued.  The RABV-MERS vaccine has demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy in mice. An additional efficacy test is underway with an improved murine model of MERS.  An immunogenicity experiment in camels is currently being planned.  The RABV-Lassa virus vaccine candidate has demonstrated immunogenicity and safety in mice. Efficacy testing in guinea pigs in nonhuman primates is scheduled to start in fall of 2017 and Spring of 2018, respectively.2. Filovirus nonhuman primate model of human disease.  EVPS is currently developing PET/CT to investigate pathogenesis of EBOV infection in NHPs.  We have evaluated 18Fluorodeoxyglucose as a marker of increased glucose metabolism as a marker of inflammation 18Fluoro-Albumin as a hemodynamic marker, and 18Fluromisonidazole as a marker of hypoxia.  We observed increased metabolism in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and draining lymph nodes that progressed rapidly and plateaued 5 days post-infection and rapidly decreased as subjects met endpoint criteria.  18-fluoro-Albumin imaging indicated congestion in the bone marrow and spleen.  18Fluoromisonidazole imaging has identified putative areas of hypoxia in the liver and indications of acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys.  Manuscripts describing these data are currently in development.  As evidence by these experiments, PET/CT imaging can be used to evaluate disease progression in real-time, thus establishing biomarkers that can be used to validate potential countermeasures and increase understanding of pathogenesis.EVPS is also developing a guinea pig model of Marburg virus (MARV) disease.  Preliminary experiments indicate that mouse-adapted MARV causes a lethal disease in guinea pigs.  Experiments are underway to determine mechanisms of pathogenesis in the model and evaluate countermeasures incorporating FDG-PET imaging and a PET radiotracer for apoptosis to monitor pathogenic processes in real-time.3. Filovirus Molecular Virology We have resolved the secondary structure of the EBOV 3E-5E minigenome by selective hydroxyl acylation by primer extension (SHAPE).  Previously, we identified host proteins that interact with the EBOV trailer.  Specifically, HSC70 binds to a specific motif within the EBOV trailer and mutational analysis, chemical inhibition targeting HSC70, and reverse genetics have demonstrated a role for HSC70 in the virus lifecycle.  We are currently identifying host proteins that interact with the EBOV NCRs from cell lines of varying permissivity to EBOV infection to identify therapeutic targets as well as establish mechanisms of filovirus lifecycle regulation.  As a further step in investigating the role of RNA secondary structures as regulators of the virus lifecycle we are using a yeast based system to evolve RNA binding proteins that target specific RNA motifs in collaboration with Drs. LeGrice and McNaughton.Persistence of EBOV RNA in the cerebral spinal fluid of survivors has led to the possibility that the virus can establish infection in the CNS.  In one scenario, a health care worker who survived EBOV infection developed encephalitis months after clearing disease and infectious virus was isolated from the CSF. This case demonstrates that persistent infection of the CNS is possible.  To determine if persistent infection of CNS cell types can be established and characterized, we are collaborating with Avindra Nath of NIMS.  We are establishing the dynamics of EBOV infection of inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of neuronal origin.  Traditional neuronal tissue culture is refractory to EBOV infection, and the iPSCs provide the possibility to explore cell types that more closely reflect tissue. Role of NP in EBOV pathogenesis.  Changes in NP and VP24 necessary are necessary for adaptation of EBOV to mice, therefore it was of interest to determine what host-factors NP interacts with to modulate infection.  We performed a yeast 2-hybrid assay to identify host proteins from murine macrophages that interact with NP.  We identified TLR translocator proteins and confirmed the interaction by immunofluorescence.  A TLR reporter system found that NP specifically blocks TLR7 signaling, TLR7 specifically recognizes single-stranded RNA to trigger the innate cellular responses and apoptosis in macrophages. The data suggest that NP interaction with the TLR translocator likely provides the first hit against the innate response until VP35, VP24 concentrations accumulate to further suppress innate response.',\n",
       " 'Summary: Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Globally there are an estimated 82 million persons with HCV. In the United States (U.S.), 1% of the general population or 2.7 million persons have chronic infection based on the detection of HCV RNA in serum. In 2014, chronic HCV infection was the leading cause of death in the U.S. due to an infectious cause. These figures underscore the magnitude and impact that chronic HCV infection has on global and US public health.The natural history of chronic HCV infection has been difficult to study. The protracted and silent course of infection, the absence of large cohorts of persons known to be infected, and the wide variability in outcome are major obstacles to natural history studies. Five to twenty-five percent of HCV-infected persons will develop cirrhosis over a 25-30 year period but some patients remain asymptomatic, without significant liver disease for many decades if not for life. Knowledge of the rate of progression among individuals who have not developed cirrhosis is unknown. An equally important and related issue is the clinical assessment of disease severity. Unfortunately, there are no good laboratory markers of disease severity and liver biopsy, the accepted gold standard for assessing disease severity is imperfect. Non-invasive methods to assess disease severity are highly desirable for the clinicians diagnostic toolbox.The optimal treatment for chronic HCV infection is undergoing a paradigm change with the advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents. For most genotypes response rates to treatment now approach 90-95%. The challenging group of patients to treat are those with genotype 3 infection who have failed a prior course of peginterferon and ribavirin and who have advanced disease. Therapeutic options for these subjects are improving but few studies have been conducted in these patient populations. Why these subjects fail therapy is unknown.Hypotheses/problems addressed:1) Define the host, viral and environmental factors that determine the natural history and outcome of HCV infection.To address this problem, we have submitted a new protocol to prospectively follow a cohort of 350 subjects successfully treated with direct acting antiviral agents to define the long-term outcome of patients after eradication of hepatitis C virus. The two primary aims of the study are to determine prospectively the rate of clinical outcomes (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality in treatment recovered hepatitis C and to determine the proportion and rates of fibrosis regression in subjects after successful therapy of chronic hepatitis C. A major focus of the study will be to develop novel biomarkers and genetic predictors of liver-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma.Cases of HBV reactivation among patients with chronic HCV infection while undergoing therapy with direct acting antiviral agents have been reported in the literature. In collaboration with the University of Toronto, we are retrospectively assessing the rate and features of HBV reactivation in a group of 90 patients.2) Develop and evaluate novel, safer and more effective therapies for chronic viral hepatitis.Management options for non-responders to peginterferon and ribavirin are limited. At the LDB, we have explored multiple options including, low dose, long term peginterferon, peginterferon and ribavirin plus SAMe, and peginterferon in combination with high dose ribavirin all with limited success. We conducted a trial evaluating a once per day, pangenotypic regimen consisting of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for a duration of twelve weeks. Seventy subjects have been enrolled and the study results are being analyzed. This combination of agents if efficacious, would allow patients with all genotypes to be treated with the same regimen.3. Elucidate the viral pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and mechanisms of action of anti-viral therapyIn association with a clinical study using asunaprevir and daclatasvir (direct acting antiviralsDAAs) we sought to answer three critical questions surrounding therapy of chronic hepatitis C: (1) what happens to the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) following suppression of viral replication in treatment responders versus non-responders (2) can interferon responsiveness be restored in non-responders after suppression of viral replication and (3) why do patients with cirrhosis respond less compared to those without cirrhosis. To address the first question, we compared the relative expression level of ISGs from paired liver biopsy tissue before and after suppression of viremia with potent DAAs.  We demonstrated that the level of ISGs decline rapidly, within 2 weeks following suppression of viral replication and this decline was highly correlated with suppression of viremia. Interestingly, subjects who responded had higher baseline expression of ISGs and NK cell activation compared to patients who experienced virological breakthrough (failed therapy). These results suggest that innate immunity may be required for clearance of HCV during DAA therapy. Because miRNAs are known to be important for the viral life cycle, we then asked whether miRNAs were important for viral clearance during therapy with DAAs. Using an unbiased correlation analysis of the hepatic expression data we identified 14 miRNAs that were significantly negatively correlated with ISGs between paired biopsies. 13/14 miRNAs had known ISGs as targets. Interestingly, 9/14 miRNAs were significantly lower at baseline in responders compared to non-responders and increased at week 2 or 4 of treatment suggesting regulation by HCV. These novel results suggest that miRNAs may directly and indirectly regulate innate immunity, ISGs production and contribute to viral clearance during DAA therapy and regulate the immune response to the virus. To further demonstrate that the identified miRNAs regulate ISGs and viral replication we overexpressed/inhibited 3 candidate miRNAs in HUH-7 cells, a hepatoma cell line, and measured levels of predicted target ISGs using qPCR. We confirmed that miRNAs do affect ISG expression. Next, we infected the HUH-7 cells with HCV and demonstrated that the miRNAs affect HCV replication through an effect on ISGs. Taken together, this work suggests that viral replication is the driver for ISG induction in the liver. MiRNAs have a dual role to both impact viral replication and to regulate the innate immune response to the viral infection.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exploits the host lipoprotein pathway for its lifecycle.  Consequently, patients with chronic HCV have hypolipidemic profile. This observation suggests that sustained eradication of HCV might lead to dyslipidemia and increase risk for cardiovascular disease. Serial lipid panels and NMR-based lipoprotein profiles were assessed at multiple timepoints from fasting chronic HCV patients participating in a study evaluating sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks were evaluated. We demonstrated a marked rise in all lipoprotein parameters within the first 7 days of antiviral treatment associated with viral clearance. The increase in LDL and more importantly small LDL (the most atherogenic particle) persisted 24 weeks after treatment was stopped. These results suggest that patients should be evaluated for cardiovascular risk post-SVR and assessed for lipid lowering therapy.',\n",
       " 'Influenza A viruses are significant human pathogens causing yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics. Past pandemics have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 50 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. In 2009, a novel pandemic emerged and caused up to 18,000 deaths in the U.S. and up to 575,000 deaths globally. Understanding the molecular basis for the formation of pandemic influenza strains is critical. The 1957 and 1968 pandemics were human-avian reassortant viruses in which two or three influenza gene segments from the then circulating human influenza viruses were replaced with genes from an avian source. The 2009 pandemic virus arose via reassortment between two swine-adapted influenza viruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 pandemic virus suggested that it was derived from an avian-like virus possibly via an intermediate host in the decade before the pandemic. The 1918 pandemic virus caused several epidemiologically distinct waves. The so-called first wave, in the summer months of 1918, may have represented an early form of the more virulent second wave.To understand how this pandemic virus emerged and to model its virulence, it is important to place this virus in the context of human influenza viruses circulating before 1918 and to follow the early evolution of human H1N1 viruses after 1918. Because human influenza isolates are not available earlier than 1933, the only way to characterize these viruses is by identification of influenza RNA fragments preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsy tissues. Efforts to identify pre-1918 influenza virus RNA-positive autopsy material are continuing. Possible fatal influenza pneumonia cases from 1907-1917 have been identified in tissue archives and anonymized materials are being screened for host and viral RNA by RT-PCR. In a related effort, a method has been developed allowing high-throughput deep sequencing of host, viral, and bacterial RNA from archival tissue samples.  This method significantly reduces ribosomal RNA allowing sequence analysis of viral and host mRNA expression and identification of secondary bacterial infections. Lastly, new techniques to positively enrich for influenza virus RNA sequences have been developed utilizing oligonucleotide probes designed by downloading all influenza A and B virus sequences in GenBank prior to construction of cDNA libraries for next generation sequencing. Validation of this technique using cloacal swabs samples from wild birds is on-going.',\n",
       " 'Our main vaccine platform is based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSVs), a live-attenuate vaccine approach. Over the years we have generated several rVSVs expressing the glycoproteins (GP) of representative isolates of all ebolavirus species: Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Ta forest ebolavirus (TFEBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV) and Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). Additionally, we generated rVSVs expressing the GPs of two isolates of MARV, Musoke and Angola. All vaccine vectors have been extensively characterized in cell culture and their protective efficacy has been evaluated in animal models (rodents, nonhuman primates) against homologous challenges. In an effort to decipher the mechanism of protection of the rVSV vaccine vectors we used the rVSV-ZEBOV as a model. We could demonstrate in nonhuman primates that antibodies specific to the foreign immunogen play a critical role in protection. Recent similar work also confirmed a role of antibodies for the mechanism of protection mediated by the rVSV vaccine vector against MARV. Overall, we postulate that antibodies (total and neutralizing IgG) play a key role for the mechanism of protection for all rVSV-based vaccine candidates.   In response to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate was fast-tracked and shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans. Phase III clinical trials with this vaccine candidate were initiated in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. To support the clinical trials we have shown that the GMP-produced rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine lot used in West Africa protects against challenge with a recent local isolate, a proof that had been missing at trial start. A first preliminary report published in Lancet from the human trial in Guinea reports success of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in a ring vaccination approach. This remarkable outcome is supported by another recent study of our group in nonhuman primates looking into the minimum time needed for protection. We could demonstrate complete protection when rVSV-ZEBOV was administered at least one week and partial protection when administered as close as three days prior to challenge. Overall, this is a milestone achievement in the development of Ebola virus countermeasures. Cross-protection among the different Ebolavirus species and Marburgvirus is an important consideration, but is thought to be difficult to achieve due to relatively high genetic variability and the general lack of cross-protective antibodies among genera in particular, but also among species within a single genus. In a first attempt to address this issue, we previously used a single-injection protocol with three blended vaccine vectors (rVSV-SEBOV, rVSV-ZEBOV and rVSV-MARV) and demonstrated complete protection against challenge with the three homologous virus species. We have also performed another proof-of-concept study, in which we evaluated cross-protection following immunization with a single vaccine vector (rVSV-ZEBOVgp or rVSV-TFEBOV) and demonstrated partial cross-protection against challenge with a heterologous virus species (BEBOV). This demonstrates that monovalent rVSV-based vaccines may be useful against a newly emerging filovirus species; however, heterologous protection across species remains challenging and may depend on enhancing the immune responses either through booster immunizations or through the inclusion of multiple immunogens. Overall, we can conclude that single monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors can provide partial cross-protection in cases of challenge virus species that are genetically more closely related.As mentioned above, one approach to overcome this limitation is the use of blended monovalent rVSV vaccine vectors, which provide broader protection against homologous and partial protection against certain heterologous challenges. Another approach to overcome the limitations in cross-protection is the use of multivalent rVSV vaccine vectors. In a proof-of-concept study in rodent models protection against ZEBOV and Andes virus (ANDV) challenge was demonstrated using a single rVSV vector expressing both the ZEBOV GP and the ANDV glycoprotein. This data showed that the use of bivalent rVSV vectors are a feasible approach to vaccination against multiple pathogens. Therefore, we have developed a single vector expressing ZEBOV GP and influenza H5 hemaglutinin and are in the process of evaluating the protective efficacy against lethal H5N1 challenge. Additionally, we are also working towards rVSV-ZEBOV-based Zika virus (ZIKV) vaccine as both pathogens share overlapping endemic areas in Africa. In a fist study this vaccine was even further attenuated compared to rVSV-ZEBOV and protected mice from lethal ZIKV challenge. We are currently evaluating if this vaccine is still protective against ZEBOV infection.Based on the results described above, we have over the past fiscal years successfully generated additional bivalent and trivalent rVSV vectors expressing two or three different antigens, one as a transmembrane protein (replacing the VSV glycoprotein) and one or two as soluble antigens that will be secreted during vector replication. Recovery of these recombinant vaccine viruses turned out to be difficult but has recently been successful. In vitro characterization of these vectors, including viral growth curves and verification of foreign antigen expression has been completed. Efficacy testing in the appropriate rodent models has resulted in promising results; nonhuman primate studies are scheduled.',\n",
       " 'Immunization with live, replication-competent Ad-HIV or Ad-SIV envelope recombinant vaccines primes strong antibody responses that develop following administration of booster immunizations with envelope protein. These antibodies display a variety of functional activities. The most desirable for an HIV/AIDS vaccine is neutralizing activity that is able to prevent infection following exposure to the virus. We have elicited such antibodies in the rhesus macaque model that conferred apparent sterilizing immunity following challenge with an HIV/SIV chimeric SHIV virus. Our vaccine regimen also elicits antibodies with other functional activities mediated by Fc-receptor bearing cells such as NK cells. HIV/SIV infection is initially manifested as small foci of infected cells. Within 2 to 6 days, virus spreads from these cell foci to draining lymph nodes, subsequently leading to systemic infection. These additional non-neutralizing functional activities can help control the initial viral burden by limiting the spread of virus from the foci of infection. Such activities include antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent cell-mediated viral inhibition (ADCVI), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). With regard to the latter, an in-depth investigation of V2 monoclonal antibodies was recently completed. V2 antibodies were identified as a protective immune correlate in the RV144 clinical vaccine trial in Thailand, the only trial to have reached any degree of protective efficacy. Although V2 antibodies were associated with protection, the mechanism(s) by which they conferred protection remained unidentified. Our recent study found that V2 monoclonal antibodies mediate ADCP activity, suggesting a mechanism which may contribute to protection. Further, studies of antibody-dependent complement mediated lysis of virus and virus infected cells have recently been initiated, and represent another functional activity that can contribute to overall protection, as is ADCP activity mediated by neutrophils. Since HIV is transmitted mainly at rectal/genital mucosal sites, a key goal of HIV vaccine development is to elicit mucosal immunity. The Ad-recombinant prime/protein boost strategy induces antibodies in mucosal secretions which can inhibit transcytosis of SIV across an epithelial cell barrier, suggesting another mechanism which may contribute to protection. These mechanisms are all currently under study. Recently we completed a pre-clinical vaccine study using the SIV-rhesus macaque model in which we uncovered a sex bias in vaccine-induced protection. Vaccinated female macaques, but not males, exhibited delayed SIV acquisition. We showed that vaccine-induced SIV envelope-specific mucosal IgA, Envelope-specific memory B cells, and total rectal plasma cells were correlated with this protective outcome. Subsequently we showed that female macaques developed better quality antibodies of the IgG3 subtype which is more effective in mediating protective antibody responses. Moreover, male macaques exhibited a greater proportion of B regulatory cells associated with suppression, suggesting that these cells might have facilitated infection in the males. On-going studies are investigating cytokines secreted by B cells, as these molecules have the ability to regulate immune B cell responses. We have also examined plasma cell niche factors in bone marrow and the rectal mucosa in order to better understand the accumulation of plasma cells in the mucosa. Investigation of the sex bias in vaccine-induced protection is important as approximately 50% of HIV infected individuals are women. A recent pre-clinical study in the macaque model has achieved partial protection, illustrated by reduced viral burdens in animals that became infected. Notably, vaccinated female macaques developed lower viremia levels compared to vaccinated males, indicating that further investigation of mechanisms contributing to the vaccine-induced sex bias is warranted. In this regard, we have previously demonstrated that our vaccination strategy induces viral envelope-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in lymph nodes of immunized non-human primates. These cells are critical for providing the help necessary for B cell development and antibody production, leading to memory B cells and the long-lived plasma cells necessary for long-term vaccine-induced protection. Current studies are pursuing this observation, focusing specifically on the interaction between Tfh and B cells in lymph node germinal centers. Other cells also contribute to B cell development. We have recently found that neutrophils in non-human primates can provide help to B cells, providing another mechanism which might be exploited for elicitation of greater protective efficacy. Finally, a newly initiated pre-clinical study in the SIV rhesus macaque model in collaboration with Dr. Ettore Appella (NCI) and Dr. Daniel Appella (NIDDK) is investigating the hypothesis that a novel microbicide will provide additive or synergistic protection against subsequent viral infection. The microbicide (SAMT-247), a zinc finger inhibitor that prevents proper processing of the viral gag protein, leads to production of non-infectious viral particles which nevertheless possess native envelope on the virion surface. SAMT-247 possesses a novel intracellular cycling mechanism, which results in continual recycling of the active molecule within cells providing longer lasting protection. We have shown that our vaccine regimen elicits strong mucosal immunity. We postulate that in previously vaccinated macaques, topical application of the microbicide prior to intravaginal viral exposure would not only prevent infection, but also boost the anti-envelope antibody of the macaques, resulting in synergistic protection. Initial studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the microbicide in the macaque model. The vaccine phase of the experiment has now been initiated.',\n",

The 1918 influenza pandemic was thought to have resulted in the death of at least 675,000 people in the U.S., and 40 million people worldwide. Pandemics in 1957 and 1968, while less severe, were also of major public health importance. A novel influenza A virus of swine origin became pandemic in 2009, causing the first pandemic in 41 years. In addition, annual epidemic influenza causes are also very significant resulting in up to 49,000 deaths in the US annually. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses continue to circulate enzootically in poultry in many countries and continue to cause human infections. Recently a novel avian H7N9 strain emerged in China also causing human infections and fatalities. A variety of experimental pathogenesis studies to model host adaptation, map viral virulence factors and host factors in disease progression, evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines were performed. Influenza virus infections are a global public health problem, with a significant impact of morbidity and mortality from both annual epidemics and pandemics. The current strategy for preventing annual influenza is to develop a new vaccine each year against specific circulating virus strains. Because these vaccines are unlikely to protect against an antigenically divergent strain or a new pandemic virus with a novel hemagglutinin (HA) subtype, there is a critical need for vaccines that protect against all influenza A viruses, a so-called  universal  vaccine. Recent work has suggested that such broadly protective, or  universal , influenza virus vaccines might be achievable using vaccine strategies that target conserved B- and T-cell epitopes. Efforts to develop broadly protective influenza virus vaccines were emphasized during the reporting period. A vaccine cocktail expressing four low pathogenicity avian influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes (H1, H3, H5, and H7) has proven very efficacious in mouse and ferret studies. Initial studies using HA-expressing VLPs produced in bacculovirus have been promising. Efforts to evaluate similar vaccines with VLPs produced in plants are underway as are efforts to produce similar broadly protective influenza vaccines more economically. These vaccine cocktails provide protection against lethal challenge with heterosubtypic influenza A viruses in mice and ferrets, result in the development of antibodies against the HA head and stalk along with an increase CD8 T cells specific for HA epitopes.',\n",
       " 'Our focus is on two infectious diseases that continue to have tremendous impact on global health. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is pandemic and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is prevalent in East Asia, globally affecting millions of people and having no cure. The objective of this project is to identify host factors that contribute to the occurrence and development of these, and potentially other, infectious diseases. We aim to identify host genetic factors that affect host innate restriction or susceptibility in acquisition, replication, and pathogenesis of viral pathogens, and carcinogenesis, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. The identification of host proteins involved in viral replication, in innate or acquired immunity, or in carcinogenesis pathways will provide critical insights for the rational development of antiviral drugs and effective vaccines. Our strategy is to search for genetic variants that differentially affect rates of infection, or the course of pathogenesis, and which thereby identify the variant-containing gene as conferring restriction or susceptibility to infection or progression. We are using targeted gene, genome wide association study (GWAS), and functional approaches to discover genes associated with HIV-1, HBV infection and HBV-associated liver cancer. We have also formed international collaborations with researchers in South Africa and China to mentor fellows, build capacity, and perform research that address important public health questions (i.e. HIV in South Africa and HBV-associated liver cancer in China). Accomplishments: 1) APOL1 associations with renal disease in a setting of HIV infection. HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk for kidney diseases, including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), non-collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), immune-complex kidney disease, ]as well as kidney injury resulting from prolonged exposure to antiretroviral therapy. APOL1 protein confers resistance to most forms of Trypanosoma brucei, the cause of trypanosomiasis, by lysing the parasite. Two coding variants in the APOL1 gene extend the resistance to T. brucei strains that cause human trypanosomiasis, but at the cost of increasing risk of chronic and end stage kidney disease. The risk is particularly high for persons with untreated HIV infection (odds ratios 29 and 89 in African Americans and South Africans, respectively) where the lifetime risk of developing HIVAN, a progressive form of kidney disease, is 50%. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIVAN prevalence has waned, and has been replaced with ART-treated patients, FSGS and numerous forms of immune complex disease have been reported. In addition, patients lacking sustained suppression of HIV replication have been reported to have more rapid decline in kidney function.) An international panel of experts in the genetics and genomics of HIV-associated kidney disease and the natural history, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals was organized by KDIGO to define best practices for the prevention and management of kidney disease in HIV-positive individuals. As co-chair of the workshop for Genetics/Genomics of Kidney Disease in the setting of HIV we formalized for publication best practices and knowledge gaps in our understanding of APOL1 in kidney disease in a setting of HIV infection. 2) HBV receptor NTCP genetic variant and risk to HBV infection. Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP/SLC10A1) was recently identified as the functional cell receptor for HBV. The S267F variant causes loss of HBV receptor. We assessed the association of NTCP S267F in over 1000 patients with different HBV infection outcomes: HBV resistance, clearance, chronic infection, cirrhosis, and HCC. S267F was associated with increased resistance to HBV infection (OR 0.37, p = 0.005) and decreased risk of development ofcirrhosis (OR 0.18, P = 0.01), but not with risk of HCC. Furthermore, we are investigating the expression and prognostic value of SLC10A1 in HCC tumor-normal tissue pairs by integrating and meta-analyzing eight gene expression datasets (n=1200) derived from GEO and TCGA) data sets. The expression level of SLC10A1 was markedly decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared with corresponding normal tissues in 6 out of 8 datasets (meta-p-value 0.0001, fold change 1.03-9.6). Low expression in tumor tissue was associated with poor survival (Log-rank p-value0.001). We postulate that decreased SLC10A1 may lead to over-accumulation of bile acids, which is potentially cytotoxic to hepatocytes, causing liver inflammation and regeneration. The role of SLC10A1 in HCC tumorigenesis, whether involving its HBV receptor function, remain to be addressed. 3) APOL1 risk variants are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children with perinatal HIV infection (PHIV). We found that children and youth with PHIV who carried APOL1 high risk genotypes had a 3.5-fold increased odds of CKD compared to those with APOL1 low risk genotypes. This study has important implications for children in sub-Saharan Africa where PHIV infection is prevalent and many children are under-treated. 4) Association of Coxiella birnetii virus with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (NHL) in HIV-infected patients. About 3% of the USA population have antibodies to Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of is Q fever. Previously, a study of 1468 French patients found a 25-fold increase in NHL). HIV infection is also linked to NHL and a link between HIV infection and higher prevalence of C burnetii has been found in some but not other studies. We hypothesized that anti-C burnetii antibody prevalence would be higher in patients with AIDS-related NHL. Using stored plasma and serum samples from two prospective HIV cohort studies, we found that C burnetii seroprevalence was not associated with incident or prevalent NHL cases in a setting of HIV infection, which we reported in the journal Blood. 5) Influence of APOBEC3 genes on cancer initiation and progression. Cytidine deaminases of the human APOBEC3 family (encoded by the APOBEC3 A-H genes) restrict retroviruses and mobile retroelements but they can also hypermutate host ssDNA. We previously identified several genetic variants in the A3G, A3B, A3F and CUL5 of A3-VIf pathway that affect HIV-1 infection or progression. A3B/A3A are also recognized as strong endogenous mutagens in cancers. A3B/A3A have been recently recognized as strong endogenous mutagens in multiple cancers. For example, the A3B deletion was associated with elevated risk to breast cancer. Through meta-analysis of transcriptome of cancer tissues and survival data of breast, lung and gastric cancers deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found that several A3 genes are related with cancer survival, in a cancer specific manner. High A3B expression is associated with worse breast cancer survival but better survival for gastric cancers; high A3F/G expression was protective for gastric cancer survival; A3C showed protection for the breast cancer, but it is associated with worse outcome for lung and gastric cancer. We are in the process of validating the A3 gene and gastric cancer association and aim to validate A3 gene variant signatures in several other cancers. To elucidate A3B/A3A role in tumorigenesis, we are taking advantage of a natural A3B gene deletion polymorphism that is Asian-specific. We found that A3B deletion may not affect risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing 327 HCC cases with over 1000 HBV virus chronic carriers. We are assessing the pattern of A3B del and A3 gene expression in additional 300 HCC tissues samples for their impact on clinical characteristics and prognosis.',\n",
       " \"Our recognition of the fundamental mechanisms mRNA expression, exemplified by the regulated expression of HIV, provided the basics for our interest in developing preventive HIV pDNA based vaccine strategies. Attractive features of the pDNA platform lie in its simplicity, versatility, stability, with repeated administration without vector immunity, being a non-replicating vaccine and not association with adverse effects. Several pDNA vaccines are currently in clinical trials against HIV and cancer and there is a licensed pDNA vaccine against dog melanoma. We are testing immunogenicity of SIV and HIV pDNA vaccines in mice and selected pDNA candidates advance to the macaque model. Some of our successful candidates are now moving to clinical trials. Because intramuscular injection of pDNA induces relatively low immune responses in macaques and humans, we are testing additional delivery methods, including in vivo electroporation and liposomes. We reported that electroporation dramatically increased the efficiency of DNA delivery in naive macaques, leading to greatly augmented antigen expression and resulting in the induction of highest levels of T cell responses. Our pDNA vaccine includes the cytokine IL-12 pDNA (expressed from optimized pDNA) as adjuvant and we reported increased magnitude and quality of the responses. Importantly, we reported the dissemination of the pDNA vaccine induced T cell responses to mucosal sites including rectal and vaginal mucosa, the portal of entry of HIV. We also found that pDNA induced immune responses show extraordinary longevity in vaccinated macaques detectable for several years after the last vaccination. pDNA vaccination elicits moderate humoral immune responses in macaques. We showed that a protein boost can induce higher levels of Ab. We found that co-delivery of pDNA+protein, using either unadjuvanted or adjuvanted protein, in the same muscle at the same time increased Ab production and mucosal dissemination. DNA+Protein co-immunization is superior to vaccination with either of the two individual components in eliciting humoral immune responses. Using pDNA-only vaccination, we found that our optimized DNA vaccine vectors are able to induce potent immune responses able to protect from high viremia. Combination of pDNA+Protein induces potent humoral responses able to significantly delay or prevent virus acquisition and improvement in virological control of the highly pathogenic SIV challenge. HIV Env is a complex highly glycosylated protein. The ever-evolving virus has found uncountable ways to escape the immune system. In addition, the combination of dominant epitopes that distract the immune system are favored over subdominant more conserved epitopes (both for cellular and humoral responses) provide a major stumbling block for the development of a successful vaccine. Since HIV RV144 trial showed modest efficacy associated with responses to the V2 region in Env, we are exploring novel approaches to prime the immune system focusing on V2 epitopes to induce more effective responses. In addition, we are also testing novel protein adjuvants to improve vaccine efficacy. One promising candidate is the combination of TLR4+TLR7 agonist that induced humoral immune responses able to significantly protect against heterologous challenge. In a collaborative effort, we are testing the concept of combining vaccine against rubella and HIV. This regimen includes Gag as immunogen, because Gag-specific T cell responses were reported to correlate with control of viremia in infected individuals. Vaccine regimens including rubella vector and SIV gag DNA in different prime-boost combinations resulted in robust long-lasting cellular responses with significant increase of cellular responses upon boost. In an expansion, a novel HIV gp120 engineered outer domain (eOD) that is targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies was included in the rubella vaccine. The rubella/eOD vectors stably expressed glycoproteins can bind germline precursors and mature forms of VRC01-class broadly neutralizing antibodies. These vectors potentially could be used as part of a sequential immunization strategy to initiate the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Rubella vectors provide a potent platform for inducing HIV-specific immunity that can be combined with DNA in a prime-boost regimen to elicit durable cellular immunity. We continue to build on this vaccine platform for therapeutic approaches. An ideal HIV vaccine should provide protection against all HIV-1 variants. Thus, an important aspect of HIV vaccine development is the selection of immunogens, which has to take into consideration the diversity of the different HIV clades and the identification of the critical epitopes able to induce relevant immune responses, avoiding potential immunodominant  decoy  epitopes. Indeed, we reported a potent impact of Env on the induction of Gag cellular responses. To address these problems, we are exploring approaches to maximize immunological strength and breadth using mosaic and consensus molecules as well as focusing on highly conserved regions of HIV to induce immune responses to nearly invariable proteome segments, essential for the function of the virus, while excluding responses to variable and potentially immunodominant  decoy  epitopes. Using the latter, we have developed two distinct approaches focusing on conserved regions of HIV. We developed a prototype vaccine targeting highly conserved regions within the p24gag (p24CE DNA vaccine). Immunogens were engineered encoding conserved elements (CE) of HIV-1 selected on the basis of stringent conservation, functional importance, broad HLA-coverage, and association with viral control. In proof-of-concept studies in mice and macaques, we demonstrated that immunization with CE pDNA elicits robust cellular and humoral immune responses against CE, which cannot be achieved by p55gag DNA vaccination. This vaccine induces potent cytotoxic T cells responses targeting the Achilles' heel of the virus and induces robust immune responses to subdominant epitopes. Importantly, we demonstrated that priming with CE pDNA and boosting with p55gag pDNA greatly augment the CE-specific responses and that inclusion of the p24CE+gag pDNA in the boost maximizes both magnitude and breadth. We identified a novel and effective strategy to maximize responses against Gag and provide a novel strategy to shift the immunodominance hierarchy and to induce robust immune responses to subdominant epitopes. We have further expanded the CE concept to HIV Env. As found for HIV gag CE, we reported that the identified CE in HIV env are subdominant and that our novel DNA vaccine regimen by including a CE DNA prime alters the immunhierarchy and enable induction of robust cytotoxic T cell responses recognizing these epitopes. The vaccine will allows us to expand our vaccine trials to include also therapeutic applications in the macaque model. We are translating the novel HIV CE DNA vaccine concept (CE DNA prime-CE+full length gag DNA boost) to the clinic in an HVTN/DAIDS-supported clinical trial (HVTN 119; open August 24, 2017) with the aim to test whether our p24CE pDNA vaccine concept elicits superior breath and magnitude of Gag responses compared to the optimized immunogen comprising the complete p55Gag protein. cGMP preparations of our pDNA molecules have been generated and tested for potency and immunogenicity. This vaccine includes IL-12 pDNA as molecular adjuvant and in vivo electroporation as pDNA delivery method, two vaccine components our research had shown to be of outmost importance to induce potent T cell responses in macaques. HVTN 119 will combine several of milestones (pDNA expression vectors, adjuvants and delivery) we have achieved over many years in vaccine development.\",\n",
       " 'This clinical research project is for clinical trials related to active immunity (preventive vaccines) and passive immunity (monoclonal antibodies) directed against HIV that are conducted by the VRC Clinical Trials Program (CTP).

       " 'The mosquito- and tick-borne viruses within the Flaviviridae family comprise important emerging and re-emerging pathogens Japanese encephalitis (JEV), tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), West Nile (WNV), St. Louise encephalitis (SLEV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses that have caused outbreaks of severe and often fatal diseases in humans in many regions of the world. During the past decades, both mosquito- and tick-borne flaviviruses expanded their geographic range and emerged in new areas where their spread resulted in severe impact on wildlife. The Neurotropic Flaviviruses Section (NFS) is currently engaged in the development of vaccines against diseases caused by neurotropic flaviviruses from three major groups: JEV serocomplex, TBEV serocomplex and ZIKV. JEV is transmitted in Southeast Asia and results in an estimated 60,000 annual cases of which about 30% are fatal. SLEV is endemic in Central and South America, and more than 10,000 cases of neuroinvasive SLEV disease have been reported in the USA. Currently, WNV is the major source of viral encephalitis in the North America. During the 1999-2016 epidemics, nearly 3 million people were infected with WNV in the US, with about 21,078 CDC-reported cases of neuroinvasive disease and 1985 deaths, majority of which occurred in the elderly. Over the last decade, ZIKV had emerged explosively in Latin America and is associated with catastrophic fetal abnormalities including microcephaly and spontaneous abortion. Unlike other members of the Flaviviridae family, ZIKV was able to establish persistent infection in humans and can be transmitted sexually, posing new challenges for controlling virus outbreaks. Live-attenuated virus vaccines are known to have several favorable advantages compared to other vaccine formulations and elicit a durable protective immunity after a single dose. Therefore, development of safe and efficacious vaccines is of significant benefit for public health in prevention of neurotropic virus-associated illness in populations living in endemic areas.Successful attenuation of a neurotropic virus pathogenesis depends on the prevention of virus entry into the central nervous system (CNS) and restriction of its replication in the neurons. Thus, to limit virus access into CNS, the attenuated vaccine candidates against neurotropic JEV, WNV, SLEV and TBEV are being developed in the NFS using the strategies based on chimerization of a neurovirulent virus with a non-neuroinvasive dengue type 4 flavivirus (DEN4) or naturally attenuated tick-borne Langat virus (LGT) and introduction of attenuating mutations.  To restrict viral replication in the neurons, we have developed and utilized an effective strategy for selective control of virus neurotropism by targeting of viral genome for cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the brain. The most attenuated vaccine candidates were then evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, their ability to protect mice and monkeys against challenge with wild-type virulent virus. In addition, a miRNA targeting approach was adapted to design environmentally-safe vaccine viruses restricted in their ability to infect and be transmitted by competent arthropod vectors.JE, SLE and WN vaccines: Our first generation of WNV vaccine is a chimeric virus in which the prM and E genes of the DEN4 virus have been replaced by those of WNV. A vaccine virus was unable to replicate in the CNS of non-human primates - infectious virus and viral antigens were not detected in the brain or spinal cord. However, in the CNS of WNV-infected monkeys, anatomical mapping revealed that all structures identified as containing WNV-labeled neurons belong to the pathways of motor control system (Maximova et al., 2016). WNV can utilize both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport to infect connected neurons. As described in the publication by Pierce et al. (J Infect Dis 2017; 215(1):52-55), a WNV vaccine was shown to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in healthy elderly volunteers, adults aged 50-65 years. Immunization with a single vaccine dose produces prominent level of neutralizing antibody against wild-type WNV strains, inducing a 95% rate of seroconversion in the volunteers. These results suggest that a single dose of vaccine may be sufficient to induce a protective antibody response in the vulnerable elderly population. In FY2016-17, the next generation of vaccine candidates was engineered by introducing multiple targets for the CNS-specific miRNAs into WN/DEN4, JE/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4 genomes. A single dose of bivalent vaccine formulations (WN/DEN4 and SLE/DEN4 miRNA-targeted viruses) induced strong neutralizing WNV- and SLEV-specific antibody responses and protected mice against parental WNV or SLEV challenge. Currently, we are working to identify the most attenuated JEV vaccine candidate for neuropathogenesis in mice that will be used as a third component of the combined trivalent vaccine against WNV, SLEV and JEV.TBEV vaccines: The TBEV vaccine candidates are chimeric viruses carrying the prM and E structural protein genes of Far Eastern TBEV and remaining sequences derived from either (1) a non-neuroinvasive DEN4 (TBEV/DEN4), (2) a naturally attenuated, tick-borne LGT strain E5 (TBEV/E5) or (3) a most immunogenic LGT strain T1674 (TBEV/LGT). A large set of modified TBEV/DEN4 and TBEV/LGT was generated by introducing the cassettes of brain-specific miRNA-targets into three distant regions of chimeric DEN4- or LGT-based genome, etc., in the duplicated capsid gene region, the duplicated E gene region, and the 3NCR. In FY2017, we identified most promising DEN4- and LGT-based vaccine candidates that (1) were completely restricted for replication in the brain of newborn mice, (2) had significantly limited neuroinvasiveness in immunodeficient mice and (3) were genetically stable during prolonged replication in the periphery. In comparative studies DEN4- and LGT-based viruses in rhesus monkeys, we demonstrated that both vaccine candidates are safe and able to induce protective immunity to challenge with Far Eastern subtype of TBEV (unmodified TBEV/LGT virus). The extensive studies in mice revealed that LGT-based vaccine candidates were able to provide complete protection against severe challenge with heterotypic European TBEV (strain Hypr). Recently (Tsetsarkin et al., Sci Rep 2016), we showed that insertion of target sequences for tick-specific miRNAs (mir-1, mir-275 and mir-279) individually or in combination into tick-borne LGT genome caused selective attenuation of virus replication in tick-derived cells and live Ixodes ticks. Subsequently, we are planning to insert the target sequences for these miRNAs into TBEV/LGT genomes and design the environmentally-safe vaccines by restricting their replication in the ticks and ability to be introduced into nature.ZIKV cDNA clone: In FY2017, we developed and characterized a full-length infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV isolated during 2015 epidemic in Brazil (Tsetsarkin et al., mBio 2016). A Vero cell-adapted cDNA clone of ZIKV, as well as viruses expressing reporter genes (GFP and Luciferase) were also generated that can be used as a convenient genetic platform for studies of virus evolution, virus-host interactions and vaccine development. Viruses replicated efficiently in Vero cells, reaching titer of 7-8 log10(pfu/ml), and were genetically stable during serial passaging in Vero cells. Using ZIKV cDNA clone, we created a panel of viruses expressing complementary targets for reproductive organ tissue- and CNS-specific cellular microRNAs. Analysis of the effect of miRNA targets on ZIKV growth in cells derived from brain, placenta, testis and mosquitoes as well as on ZIKV pathogenesis in mice is ongoing.',\n",
       " 'Vector borne flaviviruses, which belong to the Family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, comprise some of the most important emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens. The tick borne flaviviruses (TBFV) include tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan/deer tick virus (POWV/DTV) and Langat virus (LGTV). TBFV are generally transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks, and cause a spectrum of disease ranging from mild febrile illness to encephalitis, meningitis or hemorrhagic fevers. The mosquito borne flaviviruses include West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DEN) and yellow fever virus (YFV). The dramatic and ongoing pandemic attributed to the MBFV Zika virus is important because of its capacity to cause a severe congenital Zika disease as well an ever increasing spectrum of neurological syndromes in adults. Our current research is focused on the TBFV, but studying the biology of TBFV will elucidate the biology of other vector borne viruses. The research in our laboratory employs virology, immunology, advanced imaging techniques, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology, and vector biology. We primarily study LGTV, a naturally attenuated member of the TBFV that can be safely studied at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) making it an excellent model to gain insight into the TBFV. In addition, we  also study the virulent autochthonous BSL-3 POWV/DTV. Neither of these 2 agents are Select Agents which greatly facilitate research studies. In addition, we have also begun to study the BSL2 MBFV, Zika virus. With the recent emergence of Zika in Latin America and the US, similar avenues of inquiry are being explored for that vexatious pathogen. Comparison of VBFV cytoarchitecture in mammalian and arthropod cells. We previously published a study comparing LGTV virus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines utilizing molecular virology as well as confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and electron tomography. This last year, we published similar studies with ZIKV in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH) and mosquito cell line C6/36 from A. albopictus. ZIKV replicated well in SK-N-SH and C6/36. ZIKV caused an acute lytic crisis accompanied by frank apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells, but the effects of infection in C6/36 cells were imperceptible despite the fact that activated caspase 3 staining was readily apparent. These findings mirrored those we have seen with the TBFV.The results of ultrastructural studies on SK-N-SH and C6/36 cells revealed that the cytoarchitecture of ZIKV infection was similar to that seen previously with the TBFV. However, the application of dual-tilt electron tomography lead to resolution substantially better than our previous work. Zika virus infection in mammalian cell lines is accompanied by massive proliferation and rearrangement of cellular membrane, derived mainly from endoplasmic reticulum. Electron tomography revealed virus-induced spherical vesicles thought to protect replicative intermediates from intracellular antiviral systems. Differences between infected SK-N-SH and C6/36 were less prominent than those seen with TBFV. AMolecular biology and molecular pathogenesis of acute and persistent VBFV infection. The role of persistent infection in natural life cycle of TBFV in rodent and arthropod hosts is not well characterized, but may also be responsible for prolonged debilitating sequelae observed in survivors of acute TBFV infection. Experimental work by others on MBFV and the recent findings that ZIKV can persist in human semen and other sites for extended periods of time strongly imply that persistence of MBFV may also be an underappreciated feature of those infections.In the past year, we published our studies of TBFV persistence to inspect the cellular transcriptome during the initiation and maintenance of persistent infection. As noted, LGTV infection causes an acute lytic crisis of most cells, and we have shown the mechanism of cell death is apoptosis. The surviving cells somehow evade apoptosis and go on to establish persistent infection. Our agnostic deep sequencing approach to the study of cellular transcriptomics confirmed that gene pathways associated with cell survival and apoptosis avoidance were involved. A signature of 451 genes was associated with the initiation of persistence. Intensive bioinformatics perusal using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and other similar software packages, revealed that networks associated with cell survival were playing a role. The acute phase was associated with networks and pathways.We also unpublished our novel deep sequencing approach to examine the viral genomics during TBFV infection in tick cells (ISE-6). ISE-6 cells develop a persistent infection with no apparent acute phase and there is no evidence of DI particles being involved in the initiation or maintenance of persistence. A transcriptomic analysis of infected ISE6 cells is being prepared for publication.TBFV infection in the reservoir host.  Peromyscus leucopus is the identified reservoir host for POWV. Parallel POWV infection of Permomyscus and Balb/C and C57Bl/6 mice yielded surprising results which we published this year. POWV causes a fulminant and lethal neurological infection in both strains of lab mice after either intracerebral  or intraperitoneal infection. However, the Peromyscus mice show no overt signs of disease after either ic or ip inoculation. Detailed studies reveal that no evidence of POWV infection can be detected after ip inoculation of Peromyscus mice and, furthermore that after ic  infection, virus replication is severely restricted in time and place to the olfactory bulb and projecting tracts. Only a short-lived and very low level viremia occurs but a neutralizing antibody response does develop. The mechanism for the virus restriction is being pursued in vitro and in commercially available mouse embryo cell lines from B6 and Peromyscus.',\n",
       " '(1) To develop animal disease (end host) and persistence (reservoir host) models:Over the past years we have developed and characterized rodent and nonhuman primate disease models for infections with influenza A viruses, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra), and hantaviruses causing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS).  The two nonhuman primate MERS models, rhesus macaque and common marmoset, were further refined with a comparative pathology study. The results suggested that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection play a role in the severity of pulmonary pathology. We also investigated whether domestic pigs could serve as an amplifying/intermediate species for MERS-CoV or as a disease model. Pigs were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose of MERS-CoV but did not develop signs of disease nor lesions in the respiratory tract. They are unlikely to serve as an amplifying/intermediate species for MERS-CoV. We have also further characterized the rhesus macaque HPS model to investigate mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. We are currently studying specific inflammatory events to gain understanding of what contributes to disease as well as to develop a therapeutic. Much of our work on hantaviruses in the past year was aimed at determining how the natural reservoirs can support elevated levels of virus replication without disease. We have previously shown that Sin Nombre virus elicits an initial inflammatory response in deer mice, the natural reservoir, but this response turned into an active anti-inflammatory response, as indicated by the activity of virus-specific T regulatory cells. Currently we are determining the requirement of these T regulatory cells to the suppression of the anti-inflammatory response by using T cell depletion strategies. (studies ongoing)(2) To identify and characterize determinants of viral pathogenicity to develop antivirals:Severe influenza virus infections are often associated with bacterial co-infections. To study a potentiating effect of co-infection we performed a study in cynomolgus macaques using a moderately severe pandemic H1N1 strain (Ca04) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Animals infected with MRSA only were largely asymptomatic, whereas animals infected with Ca04 only developed moderate pulmonary disease. Interestingly, animals initially infected with MRSA followed by Ca04 showed a dramatic reduction in clinical signs, whereas those initially infected with Ca04 showed enhanced clinical disease. Similar studies were performed with a seasonal H3N2 virus and MRSA, in which we did not see disease reduction or enhancement. Studies to decipher the mechanisms behind these observations were objectives over the past year and are still ongoing. (studies ongoing)We could identify the early target cells of Nipah virus infection in the hamster disease model. Nipah virus initially targets the respiratory system. Virus replication in the brain and infection of blood vessels in non-respiratory tissues does not occur during the early phase of infection. However, virus replicates early in olfactory epithelium and may serve as the first step towards nervous system dissemination. This has important implications for the development of vaccine and therapeutics/antivirals.  We could show that for hantaviruses adaptation to cell culture leads to loss of virulence. Therefore, we have established colonies with different mouse species (Peromyscus maniculatus; Apodemus flavicollis) for studying virus-reservoir interaction. These colonies will also be used to produce stock virus for in vivo work. (studies ongoing) (3) To identify and characterize host responses to viral infection to develop therapeutics:In collaboration with the Molecular Targets Program at NCI, griffithsin, a novel viral entry inhibitor, was identified as having potent (EC50 5nM) activity against MERS-CoV. The post-exposure efficacy of nebulized griffithsin in the rhesus macaque model showed moderate reduction of viral load but did not significantly reduce disease signs. We have now shown that pre-exposure treatment reduces clinical signs of disease and viral titers in target organs. (studies ongoing) We have also tested efficacy of three monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as a treatment for MERS-CoV infection in the common marmoset. These mAb had shown efficacy in mouse models of MERS-CoV infection. Unfortunately, none of the mABs showed significant reduction in disease burden and viral lung load in the nonhuman primate model suggesting that treatment with mABs may likely not very efficacious. Confirmatory studies and treatment with mAB cocktails are either ongoing or planned.  We have tested the therapeutic efficacy of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A-analog, against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Low-micromolar concentrations of alisporivir inhibit the replication of four different coronaviruses, including MERS- and SARS-coronavirus. Ribavirin was found to further potentiate the antiviral effect of alisporivir in these cell culture-based infection models, but this combination treatment was unable to improve the outcome of SARS-CoV infection in a mouse model. We have tested the efficacy of the antiviral compound GS-5734 against MERS-CoV in the rhesus macaque model. Pre-exposure treatment resulted in reduction of disease burden and viral lung loads. In contrast, post-exposure treatment with GS-5734 showed only minor effects. Confirmatory studies in the marmoset model are planned.  (studies ongoing)(4) To develop protective vaccines:We continued with our efforts to develop a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses. We currently are applying two approaches: i) expression of highly conserved B cell epitopes from two separate helical regions within the hemagglutinin stalk that have shown to afford heterosubtypic binding and protection, and ii) removal of hemagglutinin globular region to increase antibody responses against otherwise poorly antigenic epitopes. We used the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector platform for these studies, which can induce long-lasting immune responses (both T cell and antibody). Unfortunately, first attempts using the mouse model of influenza A viruses were rather discouraging. We will continue to optimize the CMV platform but have also started to use the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as an alternative platform. (studies are ongoing)For MERS, we have obtained very promising results with a DNA vaccine platform encoding a codon-optimized consensus spike protein. This vaccine induced potent cellular immunity and antigen specific neutralizing antibodies in three animal species, mice, macaques and camels using a prime/boost/boost approach. Vaccinated macaques were protected against MERS-CoV challenge and did not show any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia. Recently, we were successful in shortening the vaccination strategy for potential application of this vaccination approach in emergency situations to prevent MERS-CoV infection. (manuscript in preparation) To generate a vaccine against Nipah virus infection, we used the VSV platform to express single Nipah virus glycoproteins (G or F) as the immunogens. The vaccines elicited strong antibody responses in hamsters and nonhuman primates and protected them from lethal Nipah virus challenge. We could demonstrate that the vaccines elucidated strong neutralizing responses and primed the CD8+ T cell responses. To investigate the limits of the efficacy of this vaccine, we used the hamster model and showed that this vaccine still provided partial protection when administered on the day of Nipah virus challenge. The VSV vaccine vectors expressing the Nipah virus G protein is currently scheduled for GMP production.',\n",

       " 'Background: Seasonal influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with up to 500,000 deaths annually on a global scale. Current vaccines are effective if the vaccine strains are well matched with circulating strains. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating viruses occur and lead to sharp drops in vaccine effectiveness. In addition, influenza viruses cause pandemics in irregular intervals when new viruses cross the species barrier from the animal reservoir into humans leading to up to 50 million deaths. Seasonal vaccines show no protective effect against these novel viruses, and a matched vaccine needs to be manufactured. Military personnel are also highly vulnerable to epidemics, pandemics, and vaccine efficacy lost.Rationale: Influenza virus vaccines typically induce immune responses that target the membrane distal, immunodominant head domain of the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin. This domain has a high plasticity, which makes antigenic drift possible. The membrane proximal stalk domain of the hemagglutinin, however, is conserved within group 1 (H1, H2, H5, etc.) and group 2 (H3, H7, H10 etc.) viruses and is therefore a major target for universal influenza virus vaccine development. Unfortunately, this region is immunosubdominant, and regular influenza virus vaccines do not elicit strong responses against this excellent target. Our group has developed a strategy based on sequential vaccination with chimeric hemagglutinins that redirects the immune response towards the conserved stalk domain.Hypothesis: Chimeric hemagglutinins are based on H1 (group 1) or group 2 (H3) stalks in combination with head domains from exotic avian influenza virus subtypes. When constructs with the same stalk domain but changing head domains are sequentially presented to the immune system, it refocuses the immune response to the conserved stalk domain via a recall response leading to broad protection against influenza virus challenge. We have generated proof-of-principle data for both group 1 and group 2 constructs and have now further developed the group 1 constructs and have successfully moved them into two different Phase I clinical trials.Specific Aims: Here we aim at further developing group 2 constructs, which target important pathogens like H3N2 and H7N9 viruses.Aim 1: Phenotypic characterization of the group 2 chimeric vaccine candidates.Aim 2: Generation of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) seed viruses for the manufacturing of clinical grade live attenuated cHA vaccines.Aim 3: Manufacturing and release of GMP vaccine lots.Aim 4: Preclinical and toxicology studies with GMP manufactured material.Study Design: Here we propose to further develop the group 2 vaccine strategy by producing GMP-grade vaccine, preclinical testing of the vaccine in two animal models and formal toxicology studies.Short-Term Impact: At the end of this project, we will have product and required data to move into Phase I trials.Long-Term Impact: A universal influenza virus vaccine would abolish the need for reformulation and readministration of seasonal influenza virus vaccines and would significantly enhance our pandemic preparedness, saving millions of lives. In addition, such a vaccine would have a tremendous positive economic impact.Relevance to the Fiscal Year 2017 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program Topic Area: The development of a universal influenza virus vaccine falls well into the topic areas “Influenza,” “Emerging Infectious Disease,” and “Vaccine Development for Infectious Disease” and is named as an area of encouragement for the topic area “Influenza.”',\n",
