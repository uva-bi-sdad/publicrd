       "'Objective(s): The objectives of this project are to 1) Characterize unknown and poorly described pathogens (primarily viruses and viroids) and diseases highly significant to the USDA plant germplasm quarantine program; 2) Develop and transfer sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective methods to clientele for the rapid detection of virus and virus-like pathogens of quarantine significance; and 3) Develop and transfer methods to clientele for the therapeutic elimination of virus and virus-like pathogens from infected plant genetic resources. The objectives focus on characterizing quarantine pathogens and determining the causal agents responsible for diseases that could threaten U.S. agriculture and ecosystems, and developing tools to effectively detect and eliminate them. The research areas are developed in consultation with USDA-APHIS and the data, protocols, and tools developed by this project are shared with them. Because problems that require immediate investigation can arise rapidly in the plant quarantine system, this project will remain flexible to allocate resources to new or emerging quarantine problems as warranted.  Approach: Conduct laboratory and greenhouse research to identify new methodologies and protocols for diagnostic testing of quarantined plant germplasm, with emphasis on highly sensitive molecular techniques that can shorten the duration time that material is held in quarantine and increase the reliability of indexing programs.  Determine the etiology of poorly described quarantine diseases using a wide range of greenhouse and laboratory techniques.  Conduct molecular characterization studies of quarantine pathogens and investigate their genetic diversity in order to refine and optimize testing methods. Develop protocols for the in vitro cultivation of prohibited genera germplasm and the therapeutic elimination of quarantine pathogens, thereby ensuring that valuable and sometimes unique and endangered germplasm is available for safeguarding and utilization. Transfer research data, protocols, and products to USDA-APHIS for incorporation into testing programs and to support science-based regulatory decisions.'"

       " 'While studying the nitrogen-fixing endophytes within poplar trees, the profound discovery was made that some of the isolates were yeast, a eukaryotic organism. Since it is believed that only prokaryotic organisms can utilize nitrogen from the air, this was an exciting discovery. In this small grant for exploratory research, the PIs will identify the eukaryotic genes from these nitrogen-fixing yeasts that allow growth on nitrogen-free medium, and attempt to isolate mutants that no longer grow in nitrogen-free medium.  The nif gene cluster will be analyzed and compared with known diazotrophic bacteria and they will determine whether or not the genes have eukaryotic transcription signals. Identification of the known genes required for nitrogen fixation within the genome of the yeast strain will provide compelling evidence for nitrogen fixation by this eukaryotic organism. Verification that the genes known to be involved in nitrogen fixation are being expressed in the yeast strains will also provide further support for eukaryotic nitrogen fixation. If nif mutants can be isolated that no longer fix nitrogen, and if adding back the nitrogenase genes restores growth on nitrogen-free medium, it would provide unequivocal evidence of eukaryotic nitrogen fixation.The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include an emphasis on training of women in science. Dr. Doty will continue to lead a graduate level seminar course, Plant-Microbe Interactions in which she shares her results about the nitrogen fixing endophytes of poplar. The goal is to publish the results in a first-rate journal, and give seminars to disseminate the news widely. If successful, this research would cause a paradigm shift in current understanding of nitrogen fixation since it would be the first example of a nitrogen-fixing eukaryotic organism.',\n",
       " 'CBET-0829023R. Anex, Iowa State UniversityAs the U.S is embarking on a dramatic increase in biofuel production, a series of studies have raised questions about the environmental impacts and sustainability of biomass feedstock production due to concerns about water use, soil erosion, nutrient transport, and greenhouse gas emissions.  The focus of this interdisciplinary project is on modeling the interplay of land use, climate change, and the environment in future biofuel production systems.  Understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels.  This research will address impacts of alterations in the hydrologic cycle driven by biomass feedstock production, such as changes in yield reliability, soil erosion, stream flow, and stream flow reliability.  Water-driven environmental impacts of biofuel production scenarios will be assessed using a set of interconnected models.  The MM5 climate simulation and Noah land surface model will be used to predict interactions between weather patterns and biofuel feedstock cropping patterns.  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) will be used to analyze impacts on nutrient and sediment transport and surface water quality in the Upper Mississippi River Basin using weather scenarios produced by the MM5/Noah system.  The Iowa Daily Erosion Project (IDEP) model will also use MM5 outputs to predict erosion across Iowa at the field scale.  The integration of these highly developed models will provide new insight into dynamic interactions through the hydrologic cycle as influenced by human manipulation of the landscape and climate-soil-vegetation dynamics of the system.  The project includes four activities designed to increase diversity and learning at different levels of education.  These activities are: mentoring undergraduate summer interns from the Iowa AGEP program for underrepresented minorities; mentoring of undergraduate research associates recruited through the Program for Women in Science and Engineering; developing and implementing an inquiry-based learning activity based on biofuels and the hydrologic cycle; and mentoring graduate students.',\n",

       " 'Bacteria that become  persisters  can survive stress (such as starvation or application of antibiotics), but cannot reproduce.  Persisters consume less food, making more food available for other bacteria.  Did the persistence trait evolve because it helps individuals to survive stress, or because it is advantageous to bacterial groups, especially close relatives?  Computer models and experiments with different mixtures of harmless bacteria under different conditions will be used to investigate this issue.  Bacteria that fluoresce different colors will be used, so that they can be distinguished for measurements.Diseases caused by persister bacteria are more difficult to cure because they are hard to kill, even with antibiotics that kill active individuals of the same strains.  This research may suggest how hospital conditions and treatments affect the rapid evolution of bacterial persistence, even within a single patient.  In addition, if persistence is in fact an example of individuals sacrificing their own success for the common good of their relatives, then this system can be used to study the evolution of cooperation, doing experiments in days that would take decades with multicellular organisms. This research will provide training opportunities for high school and undergraduate students.',\n",

       " 'This research will investigate how stream acidification caused by acid rain influences the biological removal of nitrogen from surface waters. Understanding environmental controls on nitrogen uptake is essential as human activities continue to increase stream concentrations of nitrogen pollutants. While stream acidification is known to have negative effects on fish and invertebrate communities, there is little understanding of acid effects on nitrogen cycling. The investigators will study nine streams in Shenandoah National Park, VA, that differ in chronic pH to infer how nitrogen uptake processes change with acidification over time.The researchers use a basic concept of stress response - a shift in resource allocation away from growth and towards maintenance - to guide investigations at both organismal and ecosystem scales. Laboratory experiments are designed to measure biomass-specific rates of nitrogen uptake, respiration, and enzyme activity by leaf biofilms from all streams. Isotopic techniques will be used to measure the nitrogen demand of streams in situ, and these rates will be combined with whole-stream rates of respiration and microbial biomass in an effort to interpret ecosystem behavior in the physiological context of stress response. Finally, the investigators will use isotopic techniques in four streams along the pH gradient to measure nitrogen demand under experimentally-increased levels of nitrogen concentration to predict future stream uptake potential.',\n",
       " 'Denitrification is a critical, natural environmental process carried out by various groups of bacteria.  Denitrification removes reactive nitrogen from aquatic ecosystems and has important implications for water quality.  Quantifying the factors that control denitrification rates in streams, and their spatial and temporal variability, has long been a challenge.  The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which patterns in denitrification can be explained by the genetic structure of bacterial communities and the interactions between bacteria and other environmental factors, such as the chemistry of dissolved organic matter.  This project will be conducted in an agricultural landscape in the midwestern U.S. where nitrogen pollution is a pressing concern.  The study will combine modern molecular biology with recent advances in use of isotopic tracers to measure in-stream denitrification rates. Nitrogen enrichment of aquatic ecosystems is a persistent environmental problem, particularly in agricultural areas.  However, current understanding of nitrogen cycling in streams and rivers is based largely on studies in watersheds with low levels of nitrogen pollution.  By focusing on a nitrogen-rich agricultural landscape, this study will expand understanding of nitrogen cycling in human-dominated ecosystems.  This project will advance scientific understanding of how bacterial communities interact with the environment to produce an important ecosystem function (denitrification).  It will also contribute to a growing body of knowledge addressing the question of how ecosystem function is related to biodiversity, and promote interdisciplinary graduate research training and undergraduate education.',\n",

       " \"Functional and Structural Evolution of Gonadotropin-Releasing HormoneSuccessful reproduction in all vertebrates depends upon the action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).  Because GnRH is present in diverse animals ranging from mammals to tunicates, it is hypothesized that GnRH may have already been present 630 million years ago in an ancestor that gave rise to vertebrates and invertebrates.  If proven, GnRH could be one of the most ancient hormones to persist through evolution.  As such, its evolutionary pattern could reveal much about how an important hormone changed its function and structure over time.  Dr. Tsai's recent data that a GnRH-like molecule is present in the sea slug, Aplysia californica, proved that GnRH arose very early during evolution.  This project utilizes a combination of molecular, cellular and whole organism approaches to characterize the receptor for Aplysia GnRH (ap-GnRH) and to understand what ap-GnRH does in the sea slug.  This project will also allow Dr. Tsai to train graduate and undergraduate students interested in hormone evolution and strengthen collaborative ties with other trainees in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.  In sum, this project will contribute substantially to our understanding of how evolutionary selection pressures drive changes in hormone structures and functions, and how these changes allow the organism to adapt better to the environment.\",\n",

       " 'With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Professor Andrzej Rajca of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  This research consists of two areas directed toward the synthesis and characterization of stable high-spin poly-radicals (multiple unpaired electrons) and chiral (not superimposable on its mirror image) pi-conjugated systems.  In the area of poly-radicals, high-spin organic molecules with very strong ferromagnetic coupling and with stability at ambient conditions will be synthesized and characterized. The research approach is based upon annelated pi-systems of poly-radicals, for which both nitrogen-centered radicals and nitroxide radicals will be used as carriers of electron spin. In the area of chiral conjugated systems, chiral helicenes with more than eleven ortho-fused aromatic rings and related highly annelated pi-systems, including radical cations of helicenes, will be synthesized and studied.  These studies are designed to advance the development of organic magnets and of other materials based upon high-spin organic molecules and to provide an understanding of the principles governing the rational design of strongly chiral organic materials.The proposed research involves organic synthesis and comprehensive physical characterization of organic molecules, in particular magnetic measurements.  These multidisciplinary studies are expected to provide important fundamental information that will contribute to development of lightweight organic magnets and of chiral materials with novel optical and electronic properties.  A group of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students, who will carry out these studies, will receive diverse training in physical organic chemistry, organic synthesis, solid-state chemistry, and magnetism.  The research experience will promote learning, by approaching and solving complex problems.  Furthermore, the materials obtained from this project will be made available to other research groups in the United States and abroad.',\n",
       " 'Project Summary: A phenotypic capacitor buffers the developmental phenotype against genotypic orenvironmental variation. Under normal conditions, this buffering results in a robust phenotype; however,when challenged by a harsh environment or mutation, the capacitor may fail, thereby revealing the variationphenotypically. This activity provides for both a mechanism by which hidden polymorphism can accumulateand, by failure of the phenotypic capacitor, a mechanism by which evolutionary change can be promoted.The primary example of a phenotypic capacitor is Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that normally suppressesphenotypic variation but releases this variation when functionally compromised, resulting in pleiotropicphenotypic effects. While only Hsp90 has been shown to act as a phenotypic capacitor of both genotypicand environmental variation, several experimental and computational studies suggest Hsp90 may not beunique in this role. In this study, I will test the hypothesis that multiple gene products are capable of actingas phenotypic capacitors of environmental and genotypic variation. In the preliminary results, I haveanalyzed existing quantitative morphological data from 4718 Saccharomyces cerevisiae single-genedeletion strains for high overall phenotypic variance and identified multiple putative capacitors ofenvironmental variation. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that gene products capable of acting as phenotypiccapacitors of environmental variation also act as capacitors of genotypic variation, lab yeast strains withdeletions in genes that code for putative environmental capacitors will be crossed with a wild isolate strain togenerate genetic variation. The phenotypic variability of deletion-containing and wild-type F1 haploidsegregants will be compared using an array of quantitative phenotypic assays. Aim 2. To identifyquantitative trait loci that may act as phenotypic capacitors, linkage analysis for high and low phenotypicvariance will be performed on existing genotyped lines of a cross between a genetically divergent lab strainand wild isolate. The identification and characterization of novel phenotypic capacitors will enhance theunderstanding of phenotypic robustness, cancer cell progression, and the mechanisms for evolutionarychange of organisms including microbial pathogens. Relevance: I plan to identify key genes that affect therate of evolutionary change. Many human pathogens evolve rapidly to avoid the immune response orantibiotics. This study will help understand the mechanisms and genes behind this evolution. Additionally,cancer cells go through a form of evolution from being normal cells to becoming malignant. Thus, genesidentified here are likely to be important to understanding how cancer progresses and may be treated.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application to the Global Infectious Disease Training Program seeks to strengthen the epidemiologic research capacity for planning and response to emerging influenza outbreaks in Thailand. The detection of human cases of avian influenza in 2004 initiated concern both in Thailand and internationally that a new pandemic of influenza was about to begin. The depth of knowledge that has been gained over the last year about this emerging disease is illustrative of the strength of the research capabilities of Thai epidemiologists. However, the avian influenza experience has demonstrated the need to expand the number of scientists in Thailand with training in infectious disease epidemiology. Additionally, the scope of training required of epidemiologists to meet this new challenge exceeds existing training programs. Prevention of epidemics of newly emergent strains of influenza require national and international response. Epidemiologists must provide scientific input to planning and response in real-time. The proposed training would focus on methodologies that provide the most information to decision-makers during an incipient outbreak. Over the past several years, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) of Thailand and faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have formed strong links on a variety of research projects on infectious diseases. Currently, investigators on this proposal are engaged in NIH (NIGMS) funded research to develop computational simulations of the spread of a novel variant of influenza in the Thai population should one emerge. Computational simulation provides an invaluable tool for conducting  epidemiology in silicon  to evaluate control measures such as the use of vaccines, antivirals, quarantine before an actual event. Functioning simulations could also provide real-time information on the course of epidemics and in evaluating changing requirements for control measures. The proposed training will develop the capacity for Thai epidemiologists to utilize new theoretical and computational tools in concert with traditional epidemiological approaches. The number of trainees proposed includes two MPH (each one year long) trainees at Johns Hopkins, 25 long-term in country trainees at the MOPH through the Field Epidemiology Training Program, and at least 50 short-term trainees through distance education and short-term in-country workshops.',\n",

The increased demand on resources has been most notable in the AIDS and other infectious disease research programs. BSL2 and BSL3 nonhuman primate animal housing space is in short supply. In the most serious cases, NIH funded investigators have had to wait up to 8.5 months for assignment of appropriate housing space for performing studies. The TNPRC has successfully competed for renovation and construction funds, which will add a total of 1040 BSL2 and BSL3 cages (net caging capacity for 832 animals) and increase indoor square footage by over 60%. The limit on the amount of funding available through the original construction grants and the substantial increases in construction costs post Hurricane Katrina did not allow budgeting funds to purchase caging. Financial support provided through this application will be a part of the patchwork of funding sources that will be used to meet the growing demands of our infrastructure. This G20 will specifically allow the purchase of nonhuman primate caging which will be used to equip BSL2 and BSL3 housing space in three new facilities currently under construction Quarantine (Building 19), Regional Biosafety Laboratory (Building 20) and Building 21. The additional caging will decrease the delay related to assignment of BSL2 and BSL3 animal housing space and expedite the initiation of funded research programs directed at meeting national goals.',\n",

The high resolution genotypic information derived from the mass spectrometrically-determined base compositions will provide unique capabilities with which to study and monitor the transmission and genetic drift of diverse influenza strains. This project will utilize the extensive experience of LRRI in animal models and aerosol technology in the ABSL-3 environment to test the Ibis T5000 system and associated influenza surveillance kit for sensitivity, specificity, early diagnosis capability, and aerosol exhalation in the ferret model of H3N2 and H5N1 influenza infection. Specific Aim #1: To identify the earliest time and respiratory secretion site of viral detection by TIGER, we will test secretions of ferrets infected by intranasal H3N2 and H5N1 strains in the ABSL-3 laboratory at LRRI. Sample RNA will be isolated by robot in the ABSL-3 and shipped to Ibis in California for RT-PCR and mass spectrometry analysis of amplicons on the T5000. To compare the sensitivity of T5000 system to standard viral culture and real-time RT-PCR we will test parallel aliquots of all samples. Specific Aim 2. To test the ability of TIGER to detect genetic drift through mutation, and shift through recombination and reassortment, we will infect ferrets with single strains (as part of Specific Aim #1) and with co-infections with H3N2 and H5N1 strains. During early infection and at necropsy secretions and organ samples will be analyzed for multiple genotypes detected by amplimers from six genomic segments. To test the in vivo emergence of resistant H5N1 strains during oseltamivir treatment we will monitor appearance and relative numbers of genotypically-defined resistant strains arising in vivo during 4 serial passages in ferrets. Specific Aim 3. To test the ability of TIGER to detect viral RNA in exhaled aerosols produced by infected ferrets throughout the course of disease, we will capture exhaled virus in our inhalation apparatus in the controlled environment of the bioBubble. We will compare the sensitivity of two aerosol sampling techniques to detect virus, high-volume air filters and liquid impingers and compare detection of exhaled virus with the standard quantitative real-time PCR and plaque assays. Finally we will compare the exhalation of different strains of H3N2 and H5N1 viruses.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Microbial threats, including bioterrorism and naturally emerging infectious diseases, pose a serious challenge to national security in the United States and to health worldwide.  This proposal describes the creation of a center for computational modeling of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with the collaboration of key experts at the Brookings Institution, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the University of Maryland, and Imperial College (London).  The overarching aim of this project is to integrate the most advanced and powerful techniques of epidemiological data analysis with those of computer simulation (agent-based modeling) to produce a unified computational epidemiology that is scientifically sound, highly visual and user-friendly, and responsive to biosecurity and public health policy requirements.  Data analysis will be guided by the insight that epidemic patterns over space and time can be approached as nearly decomposable systems, in which frequency components of the incidence signal can be isolated and studied.  Wavelet transforms, and empiric mode decomposition using Hilbert-Huang Transforms, will be used to sift nonlinear, nonstationary epidemiological data, allowing frequency band patterns to be defined.  Isolated frequency modes will then be associated with external forcing (weather, social contact patterns) and internal dynamics (Kermack-McKendrick predator-prey models).  Results of the epidemiological data decomposition analysis, along with the knowledge of infectious disease experts, will instruct the creation and development of agent-based models.  Such models feature populations of mobile individuals in artificial societies that interact locally with other individuals.  Features of the basic model include variable social network structures, individual susceptibility and immunity, incubation periods, transmission rates, contact rates, and other selectable parameters.  After the agent-based model is calibrated to generate epidemic patterns consistent with real world epidemiology, preventive strategies including vaccination, contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, and other public health measures will be systematically introduced and their impact evaluated.  Methods will be developed for assessing the utility of individual models, and for making decisions based on combined results from more than one model.  Infectious diseases to be studied initially include smallpox, SARS, dengue, West Nile, and unknown but hypothetically plausible agents.  As part of a Cooperative Agreement, the Center will work with other research groups, a bioinformatics core group, and the NIGMS to develop data sets, software and methods, agent-based models, and visualization tools.  In an infectious disease epidemic emergency the Center will redirect its activities to serve the nation's security, as guided by the NIGMS.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to develop heat stable immunoassay reagents for Marburg and Ebola viruses and begin elucidating the molecular requirements for effective antigen capture assay performance. Both filoviruses continue to cause devastating outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Africa and threaten non-endemic countries, through the return of infected travelers, the importation of infected non-human primates and the threat of bioterrorism. The absence of vaccines and effective therapeutics means that rapid diagnosis is essential to contain an outbreak wherever it may occur. Current diagnostics are limited in terms of durability, portability and availability especially in resource poor settings and our aim is to augment these capabilities to help safeguard public health. We hypothesize that carefully chosen llama single domain antibody (sdAb) proteins specific for each of the five filovirus species will enable the assembly of rapid, accurate yet robust diagnostics. We base this hypothesis upon our studies that: 1. sdAbs selected to diverse antigens retain specific antigen binding activity when exposed to high temperatures unlike conventional immunoglobulins and 2. sdAbs selected to Marburg virus enable rapid antigen capture assays to be established that match nucleic acid based detection methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Our specific aims are to: 1. Characterize pre-existing sdAbs that have been selected against Marburg virus for their thermostability and requirements for molecular recognition; 2. Characterize sdAbs selected on Ebola Zaire, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Reston to determine if the degree of assay sensitivity-specificity is conserved and if the sdAbs are thermostable; 3. Begin to rationalize the molecular recognition of the Ebola sdAb and, in concert with the Marburg sdAb data, understand the rules and requirements for effective antigen capture assay development. These studies will guide the way to formulating inexpensive, simple yet ultrasensitive filoviral diagnostics with potentially infinite shelf lives even in the absence of refrigeration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The filoviruses Marburg and Ebola continue to cause unpredictable outbreaks of transmissible and highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers in Africa. Other countries are also at risk through the importation of infected non-human primates, the return of infected tourists from endemic regions, and the threat of bioterrorism. Since no vaccines or therapeutics are currently available for these viruses, it is imperative to rapidly identify infected individuals on-site and quarantine them to reduce disease transmission. We aim to develop novel, durable antibodies specific for filoviral species to aid the development of inexpensive, rapid diagnostic tests to meet this urgent need. We also wish to study the mechanism of how these novel anti-filoviral antibodies can equal nucleic acid based detection limits to understand how to formulate improved virus antigen capture assays.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological pressure inside the eye is maintained by a resistance mechanism provided by the trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue. In most cases, prolonged elevated pressure leads to retinal ganglion cell degeneration, optic nerve damage and blindness (Glaucoma). Our long-term goal is to search for TM genes/mechanisms playing an essential role in regulation of intraocular pressure (lOP). During the first cycle of this project we used macroarray and GeneChip technology to obtain differential expression profiles between eyes subjected to elevated pressure and their paired normotense controls. Some of the identified genes encode new, previously undescribed TM functions, which appear recruited from bone and vascular systems. Rather than continue identifying more genes, with the information obtained we propose to investigate some of the new mechanisms and lOP parameters.  Our working hypothesis is that regulation of lOP is governed in part by the coordinated expression of TM genes. Based on our findings, we now hypothesize that preventing calcification of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the TM might be a key mechanism contributing to the regulation of lOP. We further hypothesize that genes differentially expressed with high fold change values might serve as ideal candidates to identify promoter elements responding to pressure. Finally, we hypothesize that each individual responds differently to pressure by inducing to different extent pressure-responding genes, thus changing their relative abundance. Because pressure-responding genes encode proteins involved in different functions, this relative abundance could influence an individual pressure threshold and contribute to his/her risk of developing of the disease. We will test these hypotheses by using human TM cell and perfused organ cultures, recombinant sense and siRNA adenoviruses, conformational antibodies, reporter genes, and quantitative PCR.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Non-human primates infected with Mycobaterium tuberculosis (M. tb.) and M. bovis develop disease and are thus not suitable for use in breeding or research projects. Chronically infected carriers are difficult to diagnose and present significant problems for maintaining colonies of healthy, high-quality animals for biomedical research. Currently, the main methods for screening are the tuberculin skin test and a blood cell stimulation assay. These conventional diagnostic systems have limitations due to problems with specificity and sensitivity. In addition, animals with latent infection (or low-level persistent infection) are difficult to identify by these methods. Accordingly, the objective of this R24 grant proposal is to develop novel immunoassays that are sensitive, specific, rapid, and economical for detecting infection of non-human primates with mycobacteria. The hypothesis is that a combination of multiple tests, based on conventional and novel immunoassay methods, will accurately and reliably determine M.tb./M. bovis infection of nonhuman primates. This project builds on recent advances in (1) knowledge of mycobacteria genomics, proteomics, and immunology and (2) novel diagnostic instrumentation for infectious disease. This project takes a two-pronged approach that utilizes experimentally inoculated macaques to characterize antigenspecific immune responses and naturally infected macaques to assess immunoassay performance. The following Specific Aims will develop and implement these assays: (1) to identify M. tb. proteins that are targets of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in non-human primates experimentally inoculated with M. tb., (2) to develop and optimize novel multiplex immunoassays for detecting both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses targeted against the antigens identified in Specific Aim 1, (3) to test these novel multiplex and cell-based immunoassays in experimentally inoculated non-human primates at acute and latent stages of infection, and (4) to evaluate these immunoassays in naturally infected animals (i.e., during quarantine and in outbreaks in captive animals). The novel immunoassay methods developed in this proposal will be essential for establishing and maintaining specific-pathogen-free (SPF) colonies of nonhuman primates for optimal use in biomedical research, including the use of macaques for AIDS research.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Primate Supply Information Clearinghouse - PSIC (to be renamed the Primate Resource Referral Service - PRRS in 2006) provides the communications/ database network needed for efficient acquisition and sharing of existing captive primates and primate-related resources by investigators and institutions both nationally and internationally. The overall goal of this service is to maximize the use of existing captive primates thereby reducing the total number of primates needed for research, and in turn, helping to promote the conservation of primate populations in the wild. Like the PSIC, the PRRS's services will continue to include: 1) Referral Service, an immediate, staff-operated service designed to match investigator inquiries/ requests to the available resource listings maintained in the PRRS's master database; 2) CURRENT LISTINGS, a twice monthly newsletter listing current availability of, as well as needs for, primates (and most recently, tissues, equipment, and services); 3) SUPPLY LISTINGS, a second newsletter, to be published monthly, will be established at the beginning of the project period designed to accommodate other primate-related resource listings (tissues, caging/ equipment, services) thus allowing CURRENT LISTINGS to focus completely on animal availability/requests; 4) ANNUAL RESOURCE GUIDE (ARG), an annual publication that lists subscribing suppliers of primates, laboratories, equipment, and commercial services such as transportation and quarantine facilities; and 5) Website, an interactive, internet-based site that includes the full text of CURRENT LISTINGS (and eventually SUPPLY LISTINGS) and the online forms for posting resource availability, requests/wants updates or changes to listings, an online renewal form, the current ARG, a diagram of primate taxonomy with illustrative photographs, an online feedback form, general service information, and links to other sites of interest to the primate research community. An additional research component of the proposed project will be to assess ongoing primate requests and availability so as to help track and predict emerging trends in species use and demand. The PRRS will continue to serve the NCRR community, research laboratories and institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, zoological parks, and breeding colonies. This service will provide the efficient sharing of captive primates and primate-related materials, resulting in significant cost savings to the research community and reducing the time and effort required by investigators to locate or place animals and tissues. The PSIC has provided an important referral service for the past 25 years and, as the PRRS, will continue to meet one of NCRR's 2004-2008 Strategic Plan objectives - to enhance access to nonhuman primate models through a database network that allows scientists to locate nonhuman primates with particular characteristics.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fenway Bioscience is developing a new, easy to use, rapid, sensitive and low cost multiplex assay device to detect infectious agents of nonhuman primates. The assay uses a drop of whole blood, gives a visual endpoint and eliminates the need for sample preparation, or instrumentation. This device will allow testing in the actual animal holding areas for pathogenic and potentially zoonotic agents among individual animals. The device can be used in the field to screen and select animals, or monitor animals as they are progressively processed through quarantine into bioscience facilities for research and testing. This device will enable veterinary personnel to ensure the specific pathogen free (SPF) status of individual animals, prevent epizootics among colonies of established nonhuman primates and minimize the introduction of disease and/or biological variables into research and testing. The specific aim of this application is to develop a lateral flow multiplex device, which will simultaneously detect: Simian Retro Viruses Diseases (SRVD), Simian Immunodeficient Virus (SIV), Simian T- Lymphocyte Viruses-1 and 2, Herpes simiae virus (B Virus) and Measles. According to NIH, these viruses are among the most prevalent and potentially damaging to research using nonhuman primates. Success with this program will lead to tests, on the same platform, for less prevalent simian diseases. The proposed approach is highly innovative because there are no direct tests for detecting nonhuman primate disease agents. An urgent need exists for field-testing in China, Indonesia, Cambodia, Mauritius and Vietnam where field captured animals and colonies do not have ready access to laboratories for testing animals in quarantine prior to transit. In the US and other countries, most smaller nonhuman primate facilities do not have on-site laboratories. Larger facilities using this device will save time and reduce costs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some 56,000 monkeys perform critical roles in life science research in the USA, for which they must be free of infectious diseases. Many monkey diseases are transmissible to humans with severe consequences. Our device promises detection of diseases in less than 30 minutes from a drop of whole blood and without equipment. Current testing in breeding and collection areas outside the USA is deficient and here an extremely urgent need exists for such a device.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positive selection, or adaptive evolution, is the driving force of Darwinian evolution and acts to increase the frequency of advantageous alleles in a population. Despite intense interest and study a detailed understanding of the adaptive landscape of the human genome has remained elusive. Identifying regions of the genome that have been targets of adaptive evolution will provide important insights into human evolutionary history and facilitate the identification of complex disease genes. The long-term goal of this project is to further our knowledge of how positive selection has contributed to extant patterns of human genetic variation by identifying genes that have been subject to adaptive evolution. To this end, in specific aim 1, we will use dense catalogs of publicly available SIMP data to perform genome-wide scans for positive selection and identify candidate selection genes. In contrast to the traditional paradigm of studying a small number of loci that one hypothesizes a priori to be influenced by selection, a population genomics approach allows global and unbiased inferences about selection to be made. In specific aim 2, we will confirm the signature of positive selection in 30 candidate selection genes by resequencing them in 88 individuals (22 each from African, Chinese, European, and Japanese populations) and 7 non-human primates. High resolution DNA sequence data will allow detailed evolutionary hypotheses to be tested. Specifically, statistical tests of neutrality based on levels of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence will be performed, and the magnitude and ages of selective events will be estimated. Finally, in specific aim 3, we will genotype SNPs in confirmed genes subject to adaptive evolution in a geographically diverse panel of 1,064 individuals. These data will provide important insights into the geographic distribution of genetic variation subject to adaptive evolution and allow us to test the hypothesis that selected allele and haplotype frequencies are correlated with environmental attributes such as latitude, altitude, or climate. The data generated in this project will have a significant impact on public health. One of the most difficult challenges confronting human genetics is to find genes that contribute to common complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.

Although there has been recent progress in understanding how tissues of the anterior segment regulate production and outflow of aqueous humor, the processes that determine intraocular pressure, there is at present a poor understanding of these processes at the molecular level. It is likely that detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of aqueous humor regulation in the anterior eye will ultimately offer new and better ways to diagnose and treat glaucoma. Intraocular pressure, like many other important aspects of ocular physiology, is regulated by the circadian system, the hallmark of which is a 24-hour periodicity. This periodicity is generated by an endogenous circadian oscillator, and under conditions of a daily light-dark cycle it is referred to as a  diurnal rhythm.  The predominant form of regulation of physiological pathways by the circadian system appears to be at the transcriptional level, with hundreds-to-thousands of genes showing a daily rhythm of expression in various mammalian tissues. It seems likely that the diurnal rhythm of intraocular pressure reflects diurnal transcriptional regulation of genes involved in aqueous humor regulation by tissues of the anterior segment. In this exploratory/developmental research grant application, we propose to identify genes showing a diurnal rhythm of expression in structures of the anterior segment of the mouse eye, particularly those sites relevant to the regulation of intraocular pressure. In previous work, not yet published, we used whole-genome microarray analysis to identify over a thousand genes showing a significant diurnal rhythm of expression in the mouse eye. Using this dataset as a starting point, we propose here to examine a significant subset of the genes for rhythmic expression in the anterior segment, particularly the ciliary epithelium, the site of aqueous humor production. This effort could prove a valuable route to discovering genes and molecular pathways regulating aqueous humor production and intraocular pressure.',\n",
       " 'Abstract Haemophilus influenzae is a member of the normal bacterial flora colonizing the humannasopharynx. It is also a cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as otitis media andbronchitis, and of systemic infections, such as bacteremia and meningitis. Ideally, prevention or treatmentof H. influenzae disease would affect only disease-associated bacteria without perturbing normal flora. Thelong-term goal of this work is to understand the transition from asymptomatic colonization to mucosal orsystemic infection. We hypothesize that one of the mechanisms by which nasopharyngeal bacteria adaptto a new environment such as the middle ear or the bloodstream is phase variation of a DNA methylasegene, mod. Phase variation of surface structures such as outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharidehas been studied in H. influenzae for several years. The mod gene contains a tandem repeat region similarto those identified in other, well-characterized phase-variable genes in H. influenzae, but a physiologic rolefor mod phase variation was unknown until recently. Our collaborators compared a mod deletion mutantwith a mod+ parent by microarray analysis and reported that mod affects transcription of at least 15 genes(Srikhanta et al. 2005 PNAS 102:5547-51) apparently via methylation of promoters. Not all of these geneshave known functions, but generally genes upregulated by mod expression are involved in nutrientacquisition, while several of those downregulated by mod expression are in the heat-shock group. It isproposed that phase variation of mod is a mechanism for random, coordinated on/off switching of severalother genes. These studies used the laboratory-adapted, avirulent strain Rd KW20. Phase-variable modgenes have also been identified in clinical isolates of H. influenzae and in other mucosal organisms such asNeisseria meningitidis. This exploratory project will study this novel mechanism of gene regulation in virulentH. influenzae, (i) using microarrays to identify mod-related genes in clinical isolates and (ii) examining the effect of mod phase in experimental infections.Finding that mod regulation is common in clinical isolates and affects pathogenesis will provide the basis forfuture studies on the physiological adaptation of bacteria to different anatomic niches within the human host.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: Despite making up approximately 90 percent of the cells in the human body, the contributions of human-associated microbes to overall human health remain largely unknown. Researchers are now beginning to study the complex interactions between these microbes and their human hosts. Technological advances coupled with an increased interest in this new frontier in health-related research, including the creation of the Human Microbiome Project, has already yielded interesting insight into diverse biological processes. In this application, I will describe a plan to probe the human microbiome for genetic elements that have implication for human health. As a proof of principle, I will describe a set of experiments to identify antibiotic resistance elements present in a community of soil bacteria. I will then use this data to identify homologous resistance elements within the human microbiome. In addition to enriching our knowledge of the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance, this work will serve as a model for the application of metagenomic technology to the assessment of human health. Public Health Relevance: The bacteria that live in the human gut and mouth are major determinants in the health of a person. Studying the biochemical properties of these bacteria will give insight into human disease. In this work, I plan to use a new approach to identify genes within the human-associated bacterial community that confer antibiotic resistance. The methodology outlined in this application will serve as a guide for the diagnosis and treatment of other diseases linked to the bacteria present within people.',\n",
       " 'The Athymic Animal & Xenograft Core Facility includes two sites, one at Case and one at the TaussigCancer Center. The core is directed by Dr. Lili Liu and co-directed by Dr. Daniel Lindner, who oversees theTaussig facility. The core provides a pathogen-free environment for breeding and housing athymic immunedeficient mice and rats for preclinical studies. A breeding colony for nude mice (NCR nu/nu) has beenestablished to provide animals to investigators without quarantine. Investigators can also purchase otherimmune-deficient classes of animals, such as SCID mice, Rag 2 mice and nude rats, from external vendorsand have them housed in the core for subsequent experiments after a quarantine period. Investigators usemice in the facility for studies of human tumor xenografts to test anticancer drug effects on syngeneic murinetumor implants, to determine species-specific effect of cytokines and evaluate cytotoxic T cell (CTL)response to tumor-associated antigens; to test oncogenicity of specific tumor genes on human tumorxenografts; and to perform small animal imaging to detect cancer size and location, as well as anticancerdrug distribution and pharmacokinetic study in vivo.The facility provides support services for maintaining xenografts of human cancers in mouse model systems,as well as training and assistance to Cancer Center investigators; equipment and services for performingvarious orthotopic or ectopic injections; surgical expertise for reversible procedures; and a high-containmentand safe environment for investigators using Pharmaceuticals and anticancer agents in these animal modelsystems. The facility helps in evaluation of new pharmacologic agents by providing data on tumor growth,metastasis, angiogenesis, and gene expression. The facility also provides consultation services to assist theinvestigator in all aspects of animal tumor model development.',\n",
       " \"Small Animal Imaging Research Program for Infectious Disease (SAIRPID). The ScientificCore for Animal Modeling will also coordinate access to the SAIRPID at the Saban Research Institute/USC,which is directed by Vishal Saxena, PhD. The SAIRPID has 4 basic goals: 1) to provide a core service to theRCE research community, 2) to advance imaging techniques through the development of new small animalimaging techniques, the improvement of existing instruments, the development of new contrast agents and3) provide opportunities for women, minority and young investigators to use these facilities throughcollaboration with relevant personnel and pilot studies and 4) educating the research community andtraining investigators and technologists in all aspects of small animal imaging. The SAIRPID was developedby the Radiology Department at the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles/USC and is set up to operate as amirror image of the clinical department. As a result, the imaging center operates in a coordinated effort withthe radiologists (and radiology residents in training) becoming involved in the small animal imagingprojects as partners with the research investigators. All of the imaging studies need to be interpreted andneed the expertise of a radiologist to identify artifacts of the techniques from real findings. Just like afunctioning clinical service, the researchers need the results from the studies in a timely fashion. Theresource will operate as a division of the Department of Radiology with similar policies and procedures inplace for the daily operation of the center, the quality control of the instruments and imaging studies,infection control, the reporting of the imaging study results, the storage and retrieval of the image data, andthe handling of the charges for the imaging studies.The Saban Research Institute will support this effort by allocating space, providing access to, andassisting in the acquisition of imaging instruments, including a Bruker 7 Tesla Pharmascan MR system, anImTek microCT system, Xenogen multiview bioluminescent/fluorescence imaging system, indigenouslydeveloped optical imaging system, Faxitron high resolution x-ray system, Siemens gamma camera, Acusonreal-time/Doppler ultrasound and a Gamma-Medica microCT/SPECT system. The imaging facility (12,000sq ft) is a space unto itself, being built on a separate concrete slab to minimize vibration and isolated fromthe animal care facility on the same level to minimize the risk of contamination. The small animal facility isa BSL 2+ operational containment facility. There is one entrance into the facility from the exterior hallway,outside the limits of the vivarium. There are two sterile pass boxes into the facility; one from the mainvivarium, and one into a separate quarantine room that is only accessed from the exterior hallway. The.quarantine room allows for animals to come from outside the main vivarium (from the other researchbuilding or from other universities) to be imaged. All personnel working in the imaging center are trained bythe animal care facility staff in small animal care, animal handling, injection techniques, anesthesiatechniques, radiation safety, and bio safety procedures. Generally, the in-house animals are imaged ondifferent days from the quarantined animals. In this manner, there is no mixing of animal populations,decreasing the chance for infections to be introduced into the vivarium. The imaging instruments arecleaned after each use, and weekly monitored for the presence of pathogens. When possible, the animalbeing imaged is contained within a sterile envelope to decrease the risk of infection to the animal andinstrument (see Resource Pages for additional detail regarding instrumentation). The SAIRPID has anestablished track record of successful collaborations with industry partners (ImTek, Novartis, ContinuumLasers Inc.), and investigators at other institutions including Cal Tech, Navel Research Labs at NPS,Monterey, Cedar Sinai Hospital at Los Angeles, UCI/Beckman Laser Institute, the USC School of Medicineand the School of Dentistry, the City of Hope, UCLA, and University of Madrid, Spain. The SAIRPID willalso foster development of new imaging technology in fluorescence and near infrared optical imaging insmall animal models. The research will be directed at the development of non-invasive, in-vivo opticalimaging techniques and the development of agents with imaging labels for the diagnosis of prioritypathogens such as Junin virus and Listeria monocytogenes. The resource will also provide a venue fortraining investigators and students in small animal imaging through research collaborations and seminars.\",\n",

Other in vivo pathogen models wil be developed with the judicious selection of consultants, and asthe needs arise Although the Core will be capable of infecting animals through a full range of inoculation routes, it willprovide exceptional support for the use of respiratory routes of infection. The respiratory tract is the route of infection ofthe majority of human pathogens and will likely be the target of bioweapons; however, there _s a paucity of informationin the scientific literature describing the molecular pathogenesis of NIAID category A, B, and C agents followingrespiratory tract infections, and the innate and mucosal responses to such infections.The starting point for the study of interactions of pathogens with the respiratory tract is a reproducible and efficientmethod for mimicking the natural infection. The Core will have expertise to infect animals by the intranasal,intratracheal, and aerosol exposure routes of inoculation. A major focus of the Core will be to provide support for thegeneration and quantification of aerosols with a wide range of mean aerodynamic particle sizes permitting the deliveryof both bacteria and viruses to distinct regions of the respiratory tract.

The facility has a controlled environment with stable temperatures and humidity. It operates as a type IV barrier system, which reduces both the risks of the introduction of diseases into the Animal Care Shared Resource and their spread should they be introduced. The benefits of the barrier system, controlled access and the minimization of disease introduction and spread, has allowed us to establish two units (embryonal stem cell/gene knockout and transgenic mice). The barrier facility also allows completion of the long-term animal experiments carried out by Cancer Center members. All animals coming into UNMC from non-approved sources such as other investigators at other universities must be housed in a quarantine facility before entering the Cancer Center Shared Resource. They are housed there until the Comparative Medicine staff has determined that the animals are free of pathogenic organisms.

A major objective of the ABSR is to maintain thehealth quality of barrier housed specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice, keeping them free of adventitious murineinfectious agents that could disrupt breeding or confound research results. Barrier housing is provided forSPF mice while permitting supervised access for investigators. AECC investigators maintain breedingcolonies either to expand novel strains bearing transgene or targeted mutations from genetically-manipulatedfounder animals, or to recombine several specific alleles from different genetic loci into a limited set ofgenotypes on a single strain background. Frequent convenient access is crucial for investigators so thatthey may set up matings, collect tissue biopsies from successive litters for genotype determination, andobserve animals for physical and behavioral characteristics (phenotype), specifically, their propensity todevelop neoplasia. In addition, many AECC investigators use specific pathogen-free rodents that eitherhave a genetic predisposition to develop spontaneous neoplasia or are immunodeficient and tolerate tumorxenografts as models to study specific processes such as angiogenesis and metastasis and for testing antineoplastictherapies. These investigators must have frequent access to their animals to implant tumortissues, monitor tumor growth, administer various treatments, and collect tissue biopsies.

Furthermore, the individual units interact with the other divisions to fulfill the goals of the entire Center.  A.\\tVeterinary Services UnitThe Veterinary Services Unit of the WNPRC is composed of five veterinarians and six veterinary technicians   The principal objective of the unit is to provide consistent and excellent care to the nhp colonies housed at the WNPRC.  To achieve this objective, the unit has created and implemented a collection of policies that guide the provision of veterinary care at the WNPRC.  These policies, which encompass pertinent topics such as nhp quarantine, preventative medicine, and clinical/surgical care, are based on the most contemporary techniques available to nhp veterinarians.  The second major objective of the unit is to provide support for the investigators performing research at the WNPRC.  The primary way in which the unit supports the investigators is by ensuring a consistent supply of healthy nhps is available for utilization in experimental studies.  The veterinary staff also assists investigators by meeting with them prior to an experiment to discuss and plan for each proposed study, by helping compose IACUC protocols, by performing procedures beyond the skill level of the investigators, and by providing clinical care for the nhps assigned to research projects.The final objective of the unit is to provide training for personnel working with nhps at the WNPRC and at other institutions.  Through didactic and applied instruction, the unit provides training to veterinary and veterinary technical students, visiting veterinarians and veterinary technicians, WNPRC and visiting investigators, and scientific support staff.The Veterinary Services Unit works closely with the other units of the Animal Services Division as well other divisions of the WNPRC.  This collaboration ensures the most complete and effective care of our animals and benefits the Veterinary Services unit as well the other individual units and divisions of the WNPRC.B.\\tColony Management UnitThe Colony Management Unit is one of the most crucial components of the WNPRC infrastructure as it supports the entire animal husbandry program of the Center.  The Colony Management Unit consists of a colony manager, 2 supervisors, 18 full-time and 4 part-time animal research technicians, a macaque and marmoset breeding coordinator, and 2 colony records assistants.  The daily tasks performed by the Colony Management Unit include: +\\tProvision of food to the nonhuman primate colonies+\\tSanitization of the nonhuman primates caging, rooms, equipment, and the remainder of the animal barrier facilities+\\tMaintenance of all records related to HVAC and sanitization processes +\\tMonitoring and minor maintenance of automatic cagewashers and autoclavesIn addition to their husbandry duties, the personnel of the Colony Management Unit perform pivotal tasks for the Veterinary Services, Behavioral Management, Compliances & Training, Pathology Services, Purchasing, and the Centralized Protocol Implementation Units of the Center.  These tasks include, but are not limited to the following:+\\tDocumentation and communication of daily health reports on the nonhuman primate colonies+\\tMaintenance of colony records+\\tCollection of behavioral and scientific data+\\tAdministration of medical and experimental treatments+\\tProvision of environmental enrichment objects and documentation of this provision+\\tCollection of blood and other tissue samples for experimental and clinical purposes+\\tCompletion of inventory tasks for the Purchasing Unit for all sanitization supplies, chemicals, and personal protective equipment+\\tIn collaboration with the Training Coordinator:o\\tProvision of training to all personnel and any outside colleagues who may come in contact with nonhuman primates at the WNPRCo\\tProvision of continuing education opportunities in the form of mini-lectures and involvement in the American Association for Laboratory Animals Science lectures and certification programsFinally, in cooperation with the Senior Management Team, the Colony Manager maintains the nhp breeding colonies of the Center and ensures that a sufficient supply of healthy, genetically characterized diverse animals are available to core, collaborative, and outside investigators.C.\\tColony Records SubunitOne full-time and one part-time assistant staff this subunit of Colony Management. The subunit's staff is responsible for the daily entry of all data related to the nonhuman primate colony including clinical procedures, animal location transfers, treatments, research procedures, surgical procedures, sample collections, and health observations.  Colony Records staff also assure the quality control of data entries, train new staff on how to use the Animal Records Database, and perform database queries.  The subunit is appropriately situated in the Colony Management unit to foster frequent communication among personnel performing the work being documented.  The unit works closely with the Information Services Division of the WNPRC to continuously improve the Internet-based version of the Colony Records Database and to facilitate and simplify the data entry and retrieval process.D.\\tBehavioral Management Unit The Behavioral Management Unit and its personnel have been very active in the last year. The Unit has augmented its environmental enrichment program, implemented a behavioral assessment program, incorporated behavioral data into the colony records database, and is assembling data for presentation at scientific meetings and for publication in appropriate peer review journals.  The Behavioral Management staff utilizes a combination of environmental enrichment, behavior modification, and positive reinforcement, in attempt to promote a diverse array of species typical behaviors in the captive nhps, increase each animal's control and utilization of their environment, and decrease the occurrence of stereotypical and self-injurious behavior. The Environmental Enrichment Plan remains unchanged from last year.  This plan  consists of the following components: +\\tSocial companionship+\\tForaging+\\tFood enrichment+\\tHuman to non-human interaction+\\tStructural enrichment+\\tManipulanda +\\tAdditional sensory stimulation  Each component of the enrichment plan has been designed to work in unison with the other components to create a comfortable and psychologically challenging environment for the nhps.E.\\tCompliance and Training Unit Compliance and Training is a multi-dimensional unit with a variety of responsibilities.  The primary objectives of the unit are to train all personnel at the WNPRC who may come in contact with nhps or their tissue; to ensure that the WNPRC facilities and personnel remain compliant with all animal welfare regulations; to assist investigators in the development of IACUC protocols; and to guide the Occupational Health and Safety Program of the Center.  Since its inception in 2005, the unit has worked in collaboration with the various divisions and investigators of the WNPRC to standardize training and promote a center-wide atmosphere of regulatory compliance and safety.Over the last year, the Compliance and Training Unit has expanded the training program to include the following: laboratory safety training, general safety training, appropriate responses to emergency situations, and hands on training for research staff with husbandry and animal handling duties.  The unit has also expanded the collaboration with departments on the UW-Madison campus and other non-UW facilities, both at the local and international level.  The Unit has streamlined the process to gain facility access and barrier access, and has been working with all units and laboratories to standardize the documentation of all training.  Nearly all standard operating procedures were carefully re-evaluated and revised to be more specific with their content, and an effective electronic verification form was developed to ensure compliance with review of revised SOPs. The biggest challenge the Compliance and Training Unit faces is the inability to track all required training, plus SOP review in a single compliance and training database.   The unit will continue to work with the IT staff to develop a compliance and training database that will track all training and SOP review requirements as well as other requirements such as semiannual TB testing.F.\\tPathology Services UnitThe Pathology Services unit has been an integral part of the WNPRC since it's inception. Pathology services has two main functions 1) to support nonhuman primate colony health and the clinical veterinary staff by providing rapid diagnoses of disease and 2) to support all research projects at the WNPRC that involve terminal procedures, surgical biopsies and/or clinical pathology. Complete gross necropsies are performed on all animals, whether they are euthanized for clinical reasons, die spontaneously, or are euthanized for experimental purposes.  Tissues from these animals receive complete histopathologic examinations, except when the examination of a specific tissue is incompatible with experimental protocols. The tissue distribution program provides primate tissue to investigators affiliated with WNPRC, the University of Wisconsin, other academic institutions, and private industry. A comprehensive tissue library of both rhesus macaque and common marmoset tissues is maintained for both retrospective and prospective studies.G.\\tAllocation of Resource AccessThe Animal Services Division works closely with the Centralized Protocol Implementation Unit and the WNPRC Executive Committee to review all requests for access to the Center's nonhuman primate colonies.  Equitable decisions are made by these three entities to ensure that all PIs have access to the nonhuman primates they require for their IACUC-approved experimental protocols.Pathology Services notifies investigators of the resource via the Primate Center website, scientific meetings, and through the nonhuman primate biological materials distribution program. To date, no requests have been denied. All core WNPRC labs use Pathology Services at some point in their projects, and numerous campus affiliates avail of this service. In addition, since May 1, 2007, 20 investigators from non-host institutions received a total of 129 samples, representing tissues, organs and genetic material from Macaca mulatta and Callithrix jacchus. Please see the Research Services section of this progress report for a table of species, specimen types and numbers.H.\\tDisseminationThe Associate Director of Animal Services strives to ensure that important information discovered or developed by the division is disseminated to the greater scientific community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and at national meetings.  Over the last year, members of the division have presented four presentations at two national meetings. We request that projects utilizing Pathology Services acknowledge the service in manuscripts and presentations. The unit's pathologists also lecture regularly on primate pathology to WNPRC staff, veterinary pathology residents on campus, and to veterinary students. One unit member presented a short outreach program to a local Girl Scout troop that involved the creation of enrichment toys for animals and a follow-up meeting so that the children could see the results of their work.I.\\tProgressIn 2007, the Pathology Services Unit was added to the Animal Services Division.  This addition has improved the communication and production of both the clinical veterinarians and the veterinary pathologists of the division. The WNPRC has two part time pathologists and is conducting a search for a third pathologist. The unit has continued to function smoothly during 2007. Unit members have participated in the submission of 2 RO1 grants for the further development of the Primate Pathology Image Database and for the development of Primate Pathology Ontology. Members have provided training to scientists and staff at a primate research facility in China and will continue to work with Chinese collaborators in 2008.The Behavioral Management unit is striving to develop their overall program from simply providing environmental enrichment and pairing animals to generating true academic output that is relevant to the field of nonhuman primate behavior.J.\\tHighlightsThe Animal Services Division responded energetically to the NCRR mandate that the eight NPRCs act as a true consortium.  The Attending Veterinarian is an active member of the Primate Medicine Training Consortium and is also involved in the Colony Management Production Working Group with the Colony Manager of the WNPRC and personnel from the other seven NPRCs.  The Behavioral Management Coordinator is one of the founding members of the Behavioral Management Consortium that consists of coordinators from all eight NPRCs.  Finally, the Head Pathologist has played a pivotal role in the creation and success of the Primate Pathology Images Database that consists of pathologists from all eight NPRCs.The Compliance & Training Unit performed 56 protocol reviews for investigators performing nonhuman primate research at the WNPRC.The members of the Colony Management Unit obtained almost 5000 blood samples for investigators performing nonhuman primate research at the WNPRC.K.\\tChallenges and ConcernsThe WNPRC will occupy a new 300 animal vivarium in late 2008 and are currently in the process of recruiting new veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and animal research technicians to help run this facility.L.\\tTrainingOver the last year, the Veterinary Services Unit provided training in the form of multi-week externships or day-long courses to 22 veterinary students and 31 veterinary technicians.  In addition, the Compliance & Training Unit provided 70 individuals with an introduction to nonhuman handling and provided 174 individuals with specialized (husbandry, behavior, and research) nonhuman primate training.  In 2007, Pathology Unit members participated in clinical pathology training to provide additional services for colony management, provided training in specialized NHP necropsy procedures to campus pathologists and multiple consultations on NHP cases and provided preparatory training for the American College of Veterinary Pathologists certifying examination to four pathology residents on campus.Publications note: Animal Services support is involved in practically every journal article that depends in part or in full on WNPRC resources.Note: AIDS related\",\n",

The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.The Parasitology Service Laboratory provides diagnostic support to clinical veterinarians as well as investigators, whenever monkeys are suspected of harboring parasites and helps provide the first line of defense against parasitic disease in the colony. All animals entering quarantine from outside sources are examined for the presence of blood and intestinal parasites before they enter the colony. Additionally, mice in the rodent colony are also periodically checked for mites and pinworms prospectively. The laboratory also collaborates with researchers outside the Center when projects involving non-human primates require diagnostic services. During the calendar year 2007, the laboratory processed 2,321 stool samples, including 520 stool samples from animals in quarantine, and 248 stool samples from animals assigned to research projects. The lab also examined 44 blood samples by the Knott's technique and 265 thick and thin blood smears from colony animals. Pathogenic parasites reported included Strongyloides fulleborni (26%),Trichuris trichiura (39%) Giardia lamblia (6%), and Balantidium coli (10%). The laboratory also acted in support of a project by Dr. Erin Ribka (Division of Veterinary Medicine) by performing egg quantitation using the Kato-Katz method on 170 separate stool samples. In addition to the above samples, the laboratory is also examining blood and fecal samples in direct support of a survey of enzootic pathogens from the breeding colony, a project of Dr. Frank Cogswell (Division of Bacteriology & Parasitology).\",\n",

Because numerous investigators will require nuclear-receptor null-mice, it is much more efficient and costeffective to have a  bank  of null-mice. The intent is to have 5 breeding pairs of each null strain in the nullmouse core. When an investigator needs to use a specific null mouse, three pairs of breeders will be transferred to the investigator, and the investigator will start paying the mouse maintenance. This will also save time because, MTAs (material transfer agreements) won't need to be obtained, nor income animals quarantine time. At the present time, we have the following null colonies: PXR, AhR, RXRa, CAR, PPARa, Nr'2, HNF1a, FXR (whole-body and hepatocyte-specific) and hepatocyte-specific PPARy and HNF4a. For the projects of this proposal, SHP-null mice will be obtained from David Moore at Baylor (Dr Wang's mentor). In addition, Core C will have the technical capability to engineer other new knockouts or double knockouts as needed.  Another feature of this Core will be to conduct routine genotyping experiments necessary to demonstrate the ongoing integrity of the null-mouse model, as well as to engineer double-null mice, and perform the genotyping. The other major role of this core is to isolate liver, prepare hepatocytes, and perform culture experiments upon request for the investigators of this COBRE.\",\n",

Leptin, a protein produced by fat tissue, plays an important role in regulating food intake and appetite by acting on specific receptors in the brain. Differences in the fat's production rate of leptin, together with resistance to leptin at its site of action or a combination of these factors can influence eating behaviors and energy use to cause obesity. Leptin also functions to regulate sexual maturity and reproduction, immune responses and bone formation.  Our research focuses in understanding the mechanisms that govern leptin production and secretion in adipose (fat) tissue. In order to study protein-protein interactions that regulate leptin synthesis, traffic and secretion we utilized the yeast two hybrid technique to identify proteins that bind to leptin in adipocytes.  We constructed and screened an adipose cDNA library with the full length leptin cDNA as a bait. Positive clones were verified in liquid ¿-galactosidase assay and subsequently DNA has been isolated from yeast for insert analysis and sequencing.  We have identified several proteins that interact with leptin.  Biochemical and in vitro functional studies will be used to confirm these interactions and to examine the role that these proteins play in the regulation of leptin and other adipokines. These protein interactions will be further characterized using NMR structural studies.\",\n",
       " \"Papaya is a major fruit commodity in Hawaii with over 28 million pounds utilized in 2006. 26.6 million pounds of the harvested papaya are used for fresh utilization and 2.3 million pounds for processed utilization. Processed utilization is currently for aseptic puree produced by a single processor. Additional processing of papaya would be valuable because there are an estimated 3.5 million pounds of culls that can be utilized annually. If not processed into puree, there is no income to the farmer and the packinghouse must dispose of the culls by discarding them, giving them away for livestock feed, or selling them in bulk to a broker for local utilization. The purpose of this project is to utilize these culled papayas and produce a consistently high quality, nutritional Individual Quick Frozen (IQF) product with increased food safety and sufficient stability to retain its value during frozen storage. Utilization of papaya culls would greatly benefit the Hawaii papaya industry and improve the economy of the state's rural communities. Successful project completion will result in a sound, proven concept for processing culled papayas into an IFQ product. This will ensure the microbial security of the product, eliminate the need for quarantine treatment, and preserve fruit quality. An IQF product would provide the industry another avenue to the export market rather than having the culls discarded or sold in the local market. This would allow the industry to establish a niche and compete in the $300 million frozen fruit market.\",\n",

       " 'Invasive species threaten plant, animal and human health. The devastating impact of invasive species have been recognized in the field of public health for several centuries, since cross-oceanic voyages ignited epidemics of diseases such as bubonic plague,influenza, smallpox, measles, cholera, diphtheria, typhoid, typhus, malaria, yellow fever,whooping cough, etc. In some countries, agricultural inspection and quarantine at ports of entry have been in place since the late 1800?s. Even in earlier times when the volume of trade and speed of transport were quite modest, highly damaging diseases and pests of crops and livestock occasionally breached port of entry barriers. However since trade has become progressively liberalized during the past 15 years, the volume of perishable cargo together with the number of arriving quarantine pests has been growing exponentially. For example, the volume of air cargo has been doubling every 5-6 years and the number of quarantine pests intercepted at port of entry has similarly increased. Concomitantly the rate of invasion and establishment of harmful organisms has accelerated dramatically. For example, at least one new invasive species per month becomes established in Florida (1,2). Invasive plants are severely damaging many natural ecosystems. Indeed, officials of the Nature Conservancy assert that invasive species are threatening all of the accomplishments of that organization (5). Australian pine encroachment is threatening the critically endangered rock iguanas in the Bahamas,giant milkweed and rubber vine are displacing native flora on the Turks and Cacos. Hydrilla is choking certain rivers in Jamaica. The Old World climbing fern, tropical soda apple, Melaleuca and Brazilian pepper are among the most troublesome invasive plants in Florida. Water hyacinth is a major concern in Guyana and Suriname. Indeed the invasion of native ecosystems by invasive alien species is now widely regarded as a leading threat to biological diversity. TSTAR-C Grants under PL 89-106 will be used to attain new information directed toward reducing and where possible eliminating the harmful effects of invasive species. Projects will address the following subject matter areas:(a) Plant and Animal Pests and Disease, (b) Terrestrial and Aquatic Invasive Plants, (c) Terrestrial and Aquatic Invasive Animals, (d) Other Projects as Deemed Important by the T-STAR Caribbean Advisory Committee.

       " \"The use of self-perpetuating biological control agents to incrementally increase fruit fly mortality is a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to intensive chemical management. With the addition of new, complementary species to the parasitoid fauna, we have the potential to reduce fly infestation levels, particularly in less preferred hosts, and in different micro-climates. When pest fly populations are reduced to a certain level, economic use of other techniques such as sterile insect release may be more feasible in future control programs (Knipling 1992). This can help contribute to a systems approach to achieving quarantine security for Hawaii's tropical fruit and vegetable industries (Jang and Moffit 1994), as well as making more and better quality fruit available for local consumption. Many entomologists have emphasized the importance and potential economic benefits of improving biological control of tephritid fruit flies in Hawaii and other tropical regions (Gilstrap and Hart 1987, Wharton 1989, Messing 1995, Sivinski 1996, Purcell 1998, Ovruski et al. 2000). Biological control is increasingly viewed as safe and economically effective means of fruit fly management, and its importance continues to grow as pesticide use becomes more restricted.\",\n",
       " 'Plant viruses and viroids induce disease in many economic crops, and may be introduced into new areas in plant propagation materials (seeds, rooted cuttings, etc.), or by movement of viral vectors. Detection and interception of infected plant materials is critical to prevent introduction of new viruses or novel isolates into the United States. Current detection methods are either specific to a particular pathogen and unable to detect uncharacterized pathogens, or are restricted to members of a single taxonomic group. Microarrays based on oligonucleotide capture probes representing nucleic acid sequences conserved between members of a taxonomic group offer the possibility of a universal detection system for plant viruses, and for identification of uncharacterized viruses to the genus level; the technology has been proven for human respiratory viruses. We will develop a prototype universal plant virus microarray potentially able to detect any plant virus, and allow identification to at least the genus level. Sample extraction methods suitable for diverse plant species will be combined with non-biased methods of nucleic acid amplification and labeling. Amplified labeled nucleic acids from plants infected with known viruses will show the ability of the microarray to detect and identify representative viruses. Samples from plants infected with multiple viruses, or infected by uncharacterized viruses, will demonstrate the broader capability of the microarray system for importation and quarantine interception and identification purposes.',\n",

       " 'Grapes are the most valuable horticultural crop in the world and the US, yet grape cultivar development resources are only modestly supported. The Pacific Northwest (PNW) represents a growing segment of premium wines in the US and is also the leading producer of juice grapes in the US. The PNW, which includes Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, has 64,000 acres of grapes with a farm gate value of over $200,000,000. Washington State ranks second in the nation for production of premium wine and first in Concord grape juice. The Washington wine industry alone has grown from a few hundred acres in 1970 to now over 30,000 acres, while juice grape production remains stable at 28,000 acres. The wine and juice grape industries combined add over $3 billion to the Washington State economy each year. Growth in Oregon and Idaho has paralleled that in Washington, albeit on a smaller scale. As the industry matures, aging vineyards and periodic winter freezes create the need for certified plants, grown and tested regionally, to renew vineyards. In addition to being the foundation of a healthy grape industry, disease-free plants are also needed to comply with international trade agreements (WTO and NAFTA). With the establishment of WTO, the US and other member countries agreed to comply with the standards set by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) when adopting plant quarantine measures. Under IPPC rules, growers are required to plant certified vines or drop existing quarantines which protect grape growers from introduced diseases. Without quarantines, accidental introduction of devastating diseases poses significant danger to PNW vineyards. Access to disease-free plants and a science-based program for importation and evaluation of new plant material are vital to the continued growth of the industry. As a source for disease-free material, the Foundation Block also is a valuable resource for ongoing research by the regional land-grant universities and USDA-ARS. Now that we can access new clones of European wine grape cultivars, there is great need to provide the wine industry in the US in general, and in the PNW in particular, with information on adaptation and quality potential of these new cultivars and clones. A program to meet the technical needs of the wine industry thus requires a unique partnership not needed for most horticultural crops. The fact that industry must partner with plant pathologists and viticulturists to ensure clean stock and proper evaluation of field performance is not unique to wine grapes, but the need to evaluate the impact of cultivar, clone and rootstock on wine quality is unique. We propose that these elements combine to conduct the proposed research. Because the environmental impact is critical for wine quality, this research must be conducted locally to determine the best combinations of planting stock for the PNW region. Thus, the proposed research will provide the foundation for evaluation of a broad range of grape cultivars, clones, and rootstocks to test their suitability for wine and juice grape production in the PNW. Ready access to disease-free propagation material is a prerequisite for field evaluation.',\n",
       " 'The European swallow-wort species, Vincetoxicum nigrum and V. rossicum are spreading throughout the northeastern USA, displacing native vegetation, altering native ecological processes, threatening endangered species, and becoming important pests in agriculture and natural areas. Both species have adverse impacts upon monarch butterflies, inducing oviposition upon plants where larvae cannot survive. The roots of swallow-worts contain a haemolytic glycoside which is toxic to humans and other mammals, resulting in reduced grazing and/or toxicity (including death) to grazing animals. In addition to pastures, pale swallow-wort invades gardens, lawns, shrubs, hedgerows, fencerows, a variety of deciduous and mixed forest types and pine plantations. We are evaluating several European insects that we have discovered feeding on swallow-worts for host specificity and impact on our target weeds. This research, conducted in quarantine in Rhode Island and in the field in Switzerland, will determine if one or more of these species is appropriate for release in North America. The desired outcome is bringing swallow-worts under permanent biological control. The impact of a successful biological control project would be reduced herbicide use and reduced negative aspects (above) from these invasive plants.',\n",
       " 'A fumigation for the purpose of pest control is considered successful when the lethal Ct product dosage has been reached. Lethal Ct products for different insect types and life stages vary and are a function of temperature. Typically, eggs are most tolerant while adults are most susceptible. No mathematical/statistical model can ever perfectly describe all characteristics of a biological system. To confirm, bioassays have to be maintained post-fumigation under laboratory conditions and observed for up to two weeks in order to be confident that the egg stage was indeed killed. The overall project goal is to develop and commercialize real-time whole-organism biosensor technology for use as an expert control system for post-harvest, structural and quarantine fumigations. The biosensor will be based on coupling physiological and biochemical responses of a specified target organism during exposure by measuring changes in cellular respiration as a general indicator of exposure, physiological status, and toxicity. It will consist of optical sensors (optrodes) and measure the change in oxygen consumption to the point of insect egg death.',\n",
       " \"This proposal seeks to develop a simple, and sensitive molecular diagnostic assay for the detection of Streptococcus equi; the causative agent of strangles. Outbreaks of this disease at racetracks and training establishments caused major disruptions, and economic losses to owners, and trainers in the United States in recent years. The control of the spread of strangles relies on a combination of diagnostics, quarantine, vaccination, and in some cases on antibiotic therapy. A diagnostic test is needed to help veterinarians identify convalescent animals that are still infectious after clinical recovery because up to 10% of affected animals continue to shed Streptococcus equi sporadically for prolonged periods, after clinical signs have resolved. The ``gold standard'' for the detection of S. equi is culture of nasal swabs and washes. However, as nasal wash specimens often contain other beta hemolytic streptococci, like Streptococcus zooepidemicus, a diagnostic test must be highly specific. Molecular testing is highly specific. In addition, the assay proposed is easier to implement than other molecular testing technologies because it does not require costly instrumentation.\",\n",

       " 'In addition to the many desirable plant species that might be brought to Hawaii, there are a number of potentially invasive plant species that are not easily distinguished from the desirable species. In many cases, the non-invasive species are desirable plants in the ornamental trade. It would therefore be useful for plant quarantine inspection personnel to have tools that enable them to distinguish species that are not easily identified by morphology or outward appearance; a problem often encountered when dealing with closely related species. Such tools would enable quarantine inspectors to set aside suspect plant material for further scrutiny before deciding to allow the material into the state or rejecting it. This has clear benefits for the Hawaiian environment, in that potentially harmful species could be detected. It would also enhance the effectiveness of the understaffed plant inspection staff. This project will develop molecular markers to identify invasive weeds from closely related and morphologically similar desirable species. The objective is not necessarily to identify species per se, but to screen out certain samples of concerned species or eliminate potential invasive species. The approach will be to identify microsatellite DNA markers for specific plants by seeking markers conserved across different closely related species and others that are specific to one species only. After developing the primers for the species of interest, they will be screened (five individuals from 20 populations across the species range) for cross-amplification. If the microsatellites amplify (the flanking region is present), the primers will be screened against closely related species to determine if the flanking regions are present among different species. If it does not amplify, it could provide a good species-specific primer set to identify the species of concern. I will identify 5-6 markers that would only amplify for the species of interest under the standardized PCR conditions, thereby creating a unique genotypic fingerprint for each species under consideration. To address the possibility that a PCR reaction did not work, one or two microsatellites, which amplified for the species of interest and related species, will be included in each reaction as a positive control. After running the PCR, if only the two common markers amplified, the sample is the non-invasive species (or something else) and not the invasive species (which would amplify the other species-specific markers). Once the markers are developed, it is a routine task to accurately identify the species in question. The process is also rapid (less than 24 hrs.), thus providing a quick answer, allowing quarantine personnel to make a rapid decision and quickly provide feed back to the importer. This technique also does not require quarantine personnel to have botanical or taxonomy experience. The HDoA could set up a suitable lab for a relatively low cost or contact identification of samples could be sent out to qualified labs (similar to the approach used for bacterial specimens submitted to the Western Plant Diagnostic Network).',\n",

Over the next 5 years we will focus on the these objectives: (1) Determine the population ecology, phenology, and reproductive behavior of tephritid pests of economic importance and other exotic pests that are pertinent to prevention of introduction and eradication of outbreaks in the United States; (2) Develop novel, chemically based tactics for detection and eradication or management of frugivorous fruit fly pests and other exotic pests of fruit production; (3) Develop post-harvest quarantine treatment systems for fresh fruit and vegetables that meet international requirements for security and safety; and (4) Integrate quarantine treatments, pest eradication, or pest management strategies into systems approaches for quarantine security implementation and trade enhancement.Approach:USDA-APHIS will be releasing marked sterile Mexican fruit flies in Rio Bravo and Reynosa, Mexico.  By running lines of traps at set distances on the Texas side, we can obtain a measure of the dispersal capacity of these flies and a measure of the theory that wild fertile flies enter the USA from Mexico. Anastrepha species will be collected and preserved in numerous locations in Mexico and Central America.  Molecular techniques will be used to analyze DNA to detect genetic differences in populations.  Various sources of potential behavior-modifying chemicals will be investigated.  Chemicals will be identified, assayed for behavior-modifying effects, and combined with other chemicals into highly attractive combinations.  Formulations of the effective blends will be developed into lures and their efficacies evaluated in field tests.  Chemicals that repel flies in initial tests will be assessed for potential as oviposition deterrents.  Novel blends of semiochemicals will be tested as bait attractants.  Feeding studies with new mixtures of phagostimulants to improve toxic baits for several species of flies will be conducted.  Tolerance of guavas and avocadoos to irradiation, methyl bromide fumigation, cold storage, heated air, and hot water immersion treatments will be determined experimentally by treating commercially-obtained fruit near dose ranges known or suspected to control Mexican fruit fly.  The most radiotolerant stage of the European corn borer will be irradiated with increasing doses until those necessary to prevent development and/or reproduction to a high level of security are achieved.  Grapefruits will be infested by placing in cages with Mexican fruit fly adults, fumigated with the approved schedule, and evaluated for mortality to larvae within by opening the fruit at periodic time periods after fumigation.  Soil treatment controlling the prepupal and pupal stages of fruit flies can be developed that are compatible with SIT as alternatives to Diazinon or organophosphate pesticides.  Initial phase of testing is conduced in the greenhouse using tubs containing 0.3 cubic meter or orchard soil.  Full grown larvae are introduced into the soil and allowed to seek natural pupation depth, which we find to be typically 2-5 cm.  Host status for a fruit fly species is determined by a number of steps.  First is a complete review of biological literature considering taxonomy of the species, known hosts, and analysis of host testing performed on the species.  If reliable reports do not exist, lab colonies will be established for testing the acceptability of the fruit to the species under forced lab conditions.  Effective implementation of a system approach strategy to meet quarantine requirements will be evaluated on a monthly basis with program operators.  Decisions concerning how available resources are applied to the tactics will be determined by analysis of experimental data.',\n",

The export trade of certain horticultural products may be affected as well, with importing countries requiring quarantine treatments to prevent the introduction of exotic pests.  Of particular concern to agriculture in the Western U.S. are field pests such as the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae), navel orangeworm (Amyelois transitella), and codling moth (Cydia pomonella), and storage pests such as the Indianmeal moth (Plodia interpunctella).  Processors rely largely on chemical fumigants such as methyl bromide for insect disinfestation, but regulatory, environmental and safety concerns mandate the development of non-chemical alternatives.  In addition, with the elimination of methyl bromide as a fumigant because of its ozone depletion, the development of alternatives is an immediate concern.  This project addresses this problem with a broad collaborative approach, examining both preharvest, biologically based control strategies as well as physical postharvest disinfestation treatments.  Areas of investigation will include the development of biological and cultural control practices for olive fruit fly, improved field control of navel orangeworm with mating disruption and entomopathogenic nematodes, improved sex pheromone of navel orangeworm, new microbial controls for stored product beetles, commercial-scale forced hot air control atmosphere treatment for stone fruits, volatile markers to identify suitable hot forced air treatments for citrus, and radio frequency heating, low temperature storage, vacuum treatments, and parasitoid releases for control of postharvest dried fruit and nut insects.  New, non-chemical methods for control of these economically important pests will be the outcome of this research. Formerly 5302-43000-031-00D (03/08).',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): The primary goals for this project are to conserve, collect, evaluate, and distribute germplasm and associated information for subtropical/tropical fruit, sugarcane, and Tripsacum. A secondary goal is to investigate the genetic basis of important horticultural traits such as disease resistance and to select improved germplasm. Molecular markers have been developed for genetic diversity analysis and for the production of molecular genetic linkage maps. Families of avocado, mango, and jackfruit have been produced that should allow the mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) involved with disease resistance, fruit quality, and yield. A candidate gene approach (CGA) is also being used to find genes involved with disease resistance and for control of flowering. Establish at other National Plant Germplasm System sites duplicate, back-up field plantings of Subtropical Horticulture Research Station priority germplasm; rejuvenate current Subtropical Horticulture Research Station field collections in Miami; and, as determined by annual demand, expand the curatorial capacity for distributing germplasm of sugarcane and tropical/subtropical tree crops.Approach:Maintain healthy field collections of current accessions of tropical/subtropical fruit trees and grasses. We recognize that the genetic diversity available in tropical fruit species is not fully represented in the current collections. Significant loss of biodiversity and increasing difficulty in collecting germplasm in tropical countries makes it imperative that new accessions be collected as quickly as possible. Implement improved horticultural practices to ensure the longevity of current collections by re-propagating old clones on new rootstocks in new fields. Add new accessions as they become available from foreign collaborators and breeding programs. Because most of the species and location priorities for collection have been established, it is essential that we support international collecting expeditions with appropriate benefit sharing. After quarantine requirements have been satisfied, the new accessions will be maintained in field plantings. Backup core collections have been established in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico or Hilo, Hawaii. Adequate daily maintenance and periodic replanting of the sugarcane and Tripsacum collection is required to maintain these genetic resources, some 1,800 accessions, as healthy clones.',\n",

       " 'The Pacific Northwest (PNW) represents a growing segment of premium wines in the U.S. and is also the leading producer of juice grapes in the U.S. The PNW, which includes Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, has 65,000 acres of grapes with a farm gate value of over $200,000,000. Washington State ranks second in the nation for production of premium wine and first in Concord grape juice. As the industry matures, ageing vineyards and periodic winter freezes create the need for certified plants, which are locally and regionally grown and tested, to renew vineyards. Disease-free plants are also needed to comply with international trade agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). With the establishment of WTO, the U.S. and other member countries agreed to comply with the standards set by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) when adopting plant quarantine measures. Under IPPC rules, growers are required to plant certified vines or drop existing quarantines which protect grape growers from introduced diseases. Without quarantines, accidental introduction and distribution of devastating graft-transmissible diseases poses significant danger to PNW vineyards. Viral diseases cannot be controlled by chemical agents analogous to fungicides but must be controlled by phytosanitary measures such as indexing and plant certification to prevent their spread. Therefore, access to disease-free plants and a science-based program for importation, pathogen detection and exclusion, and evaluation of new plant material are vital to the continued growth of the industry. As a source for disease-free material, the foundation vineyard is a valuable resource for ongoing research by the regional land-grant universities and USDA-ARS. This project will provide the footing for both continued industry growth and evaluation of grape cultivars, clones, and rootstocks to test their suitability for wine and juice grape production in the PNW.',\n",
       " 'Mile-a-minute weed is a prickly annual vine from Asia that infests natural areas in a variety of habitats in its imported range. It has developed extensive monocultures, especially in disturbed open areas throughout the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, where it can inhibit regeneration of trees and suppress native plants. The North American population is thought to have originated near York, PA, in the 1930s, probably introduced as a seed contaminant with holly seed imported from Japan. The plant can now be found from Delaware west to Ohio, south to West Virginia and north to Massachusetts. A biological control program was initiated by the USDA Forest Service in 1996. Over 100 insect species were identified on mile-a-minute weed in China, including several that appeared to have a narrow host-range. One of these, the small weevil Rhinoncomimus latipes, was tested on plant species in China and in quarantine in Delaware, and found to be extremely host-specific. It was approved for release in the United States by USDA-APHIS in 2004. The weevils have been reared at the New Jersey Department of Agriculture Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory in Trenton, N.J., since fall of 2004. By the end of 2007 more than 60,000 weevils had been reared and released, mostly in New Jersey, but also at sites in Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland. Weevil populations have established at nearly every release site, and weevils have heavily defoliated mile-a-minute plants in some areas. Our challenge now is to continue to monitor areas where the weevil has been released, to determine whether it will adequately suppress this plant in the field, or whether additional biological control agents should be sought. We will study its population development and impact on the target weed, and also carry out more targeted field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments to determine (1) ways of enhancing growth of R. latipes populations in order to create nursery plots where insects can be collected for redistribution; (2) the most effective ways of using this insect in the context of an integrated weed management program, including restoration; and (3) what factors trigger dispersal of this insect and what factors determine host-plant finding. The expected outcome is suppression of the weed to the point where it is better integrated into the natural ecosystem rather than being the dominant plant, with the anticipated benefit that regeneration of native plants will occur in areas previously overrun by mile-a-minute weed.',\n",

       " 'Ticks are important vectors of disease agents with global veterinary and public health impact. Control of ticks has primarily been by acaricide application leading to selection of resistant ticks and environmental pollution. In many parts of the world, there can be no livestock production without sustainable tick control. For the United States (US), the problem of acaricide resistance will mean the return to huge economic losses in the cattle industry mirroring the 1900s. In 1906, for example, losses in the cattle industry due to cattle fever ticks, Rhipicephalus (formerly Boophilus) microplus and R. annulatus were estimated at US$130.5 million. According to the 2002 APHIS fact sheet, these losses, adjusted for inflation, would amount to about $3 billion today. Since tick eradication in the US in 1943, mandatory acaricide treatment of cattle imports from Mexico where cattle fever ticks are still prevalent has been the vanguard defense against their reentry in the US. An increasing number of reports show that cattle fever ticks in Mexico are becoming resistant to currently approved chemical acaricides. Developing alternative tick control methods can ameliorate the problem of acaricide resistance. Among the several alternative methods that have been evaluated, vaccines against tick infestation have been shown to be a feasible alternative. However identification of effective vaccine antigens remain the limiting step. A deeper understanding of tick biochemistry is needed to solve this problem. This will elucidate key biochemical pathways in tick biology, which will be exploited for rational design of tick vaccines. Without feeding, ticks can neither cause damage to their hosts nor transmit any pathogens. Organismal level studies have defined behavioral and morphological changes that characterize the tick feeding process. Advances in proteomics and genomics have now made it feasible to characterize the tick feeding process at a molecular level. The long-term goal of this research will be to determine molecular mechanisms that underlie the initial steps of the tick feeding process. Because of quarantine restrictions, we are unable to work with cattle fever ticks. We have sufficient resources to study tick biochemistry using the Lone Star tick Amblyomma americanum and a chicken/bovine model.',\n",
       " 'Exotic pests continue to arrive in the western U.S., and many of these will become permanently established. For such pests, the use of classical biological control should remain a high priority. Regionality is essential to implementing biological control-based solutions to our pest problems for the following reasons: 1) numerous target pests occur in three or more western states or territories; for these pests, the research effort must be coordinated and duplication minimized to effectively utilize very limited resources; 2) regional importation/quarantine facilities are critical for a coordinated response to exotic arthropod pests and weeds; and 3) interstate exchange of information and exotic species/biotypes is facilitated through a regional approach. Sharing the cost of foreign exploration and quarantine is essential, as is sharing of methodological advances and our knowledge base. Without a regional project in biological control, the Western states and territories will not be able to rapidly share current information on controlling new and existing pest species, many of which have ranges over multiple states. W2185 researchers continue to lead in the development and use of cutting edge tools in biological control. New methods include the development of host range testing protocols for arthropod natural enemies in many current projects. The use of molecular techniques has increased our ability to conserve and monitor natural enemies in cotton. Novel advances in protein marking of very small parasitoids have allowed mark/recapture experiments to monitor agent movement. Projects have used GIS and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing technologies, and population genetics and systematics studies have been aided by use of microsatellite mtDNA variations and COI sequencing to distinguish species. The impacts and benefits of this project are: the availability of new or improved biological control options for major pest species in the western U.S. will result in reduced pesticide usage, increased sustainability of agricultural production systems, and economic benefits to both agricultural producers (in the form of reduced pest management costs) and consumers (in the form of reduced food costs); the attendant benefits of reducing pesticide usage include reduced food, soil and water contamination, reduced impacts on nontarget species including wildlife, and reduced human exposure to potentially harmful chemicals; enhanced knowledge of the ecological mechanisms underlying biological control will increase success rates; and enhanced knowledge of the environmental and economic impacts of biological control will improve the environmental safety of biological control and foster its adoption in current and new pest management programs.',\n",
       " 'Need: There will continue to be more regulations placed on agricultural to minimize impacts on natural resources and to enhance environmental conditions. Nutrient flow on the dairy farm is currently regulated and will be expanded in the future. Many co-products of biofuels production are high in protein. Production of corn ethanol creates a high protein co-product, distillers grains. The high nitrogen content of distillers grains (both wet and dry) is an issue because feeding excess dietary nitrogen can increase nitrogen excretion in the urine as urea. Once excreted urinary urea reacts with urease in the feces, and ammonia can be volatilized creating an air quality (environmental) issue. Nutrition strategies must be developed to mitigate the impact of nitrogen from dairy farms on the environment is dairy production is to be sustainable in the future. Outcomes/Impact: Data on nitrogen utilization by the lactating dairy cow will be obtained. From urine and feces, ammonia emissions will be determined. Together these outputs will be related to milk urea nitrogen and urine specific gravity. A goal is to use either milk urea nitrogen or urine specific gravity as predictors of nitrogen utilization on a dairy farm. Both are easily obtained measurement and can be performed routinely. An outcome would be that these data will contribute to the development of mitigation strategies to minimize the impact of dairy production on the environment and contribute overall sustainability.',\n",

       " 'Cell type susceptibility and androgen independence: The pRb tumor suppressor pathway is       frequently altered in human prostate cancer. Our previous studies in multiple cell types have       demonstrated the importance of pRb in suppressing tumor initiation. We have developed a       strategy to dominantly interfere with pRb and potentially compensatory related proteins p107       and p130 by cell specific expression of the SV40 T antigen domain (T121) that binds to and       inactivates all three proteins. We utilized keratin regulation to generate transgenic mice       with androgen-independent epithelial subtype- targeted expression of T121 in prostate       epithelium. In prostate, basal cells express K5 and K14, while luminal cells express K8 and       K18. More recently, intermediate cells have been described with co expression of K5/18 and       other keratins such as K15, 17 and 19. To explore the susceptible cell target(s), we used       compartment-specific keratin gene transcriptional signals to drive expression of a conditional       T121 allele composed of a reporter eGFP gene and stop sequences flanked by loxP sites upstream       of T121 coding sequences. Specifically, K5, K18, and K19 genes were chosen to target basal       cells, luminal cells, and intermediate cells in PE, respectively. To obtain optimal transgene       expression, we have chosen to utilize a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring the       keratin gene to generate transgenic mice. The use of BAC-trangene minimizes position effects       associated with standard transgenes and increases the likelihood that all necessary regulatory       elements will be present. The eGFP stop cassette and T121 gene will be inserted into the BACs       using recombineering technology pioneered by Neal Copeland and colleagues, such that       regulators of the keratin gene will also drive the expression of a conditional T121 allele.       The subsequent introduction of Cre recombinase (via somatic viral delivery or a       tissue-specific transgene) will remove the stop sequences and induce T121 expression. All       three strains of KeGT121 transgenic founder mice have been successfully generated (K5eGT121,       K18eGT121, and K19eGT121). F1s have been used for mouse line characterization. Mice were also       crossed to PbCre4 to activate T121 expression. To determine if tumor phenotype can be       accelerated on Pten deficient background, we have crossed the mice on conditional Pten       background.

       " \"Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) plays a significant role in terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric environments, but is a poorly understood part of the earth's nitrogen cycle. The concentration and isotopic composition of DON can be measured accurately in waters where minimal concentrations of inorganic nitrogen exist; however, there are currently no methods that can directly measure the concentration or isotopic composition of DON in aqueous samples where dissolved inorganic forms of nitrogen are present. Traditionally, the concentration of DON is estimated from the measurement of total dissolved nitrogen, but when DON makes up only a small fraction of the total dissolved nitrogen, it is difficult to accurately estimate the DON concentration with certainty. To address this issue, scientists from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science are developing a new and potentially transformative method for studying organic nitrogen in the ocean. By developing such a technique scientists will be able to directly measure dissolved organic nitrogen, as well as the nitrogen isotopic composition, which will provide scientists with a better understanding of the global nitrogen cycle. Upon successful development of this new method of measuring oceanic nitrogen, scientists will be able to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic sources and sinks of DON, which will enhance our understanding of the controls on the fertility of the ocean, as well as its potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.

       " 'This proposal outlines new approaches to epidemiological surveillance and outbreak management that fully integrate ideas from mathematical modeling for infectious diseases and Bayesian statistics.   For surveillance problems, we develop hierarchical mixture models for outlier identification that take into account the evolution of the epidemic and its spatial distribution.  In these models, the components in the mixture correspond to alternative dynamics consistent with different diseases sharing a common set of symptoms.  For outbreak management, we develop simulation-based algorithms for sequential optimal design under uncertainty that can be used for optimal prospective design of interventions in epidemics.  The algorithm is described in the more general setting of partially observed Markov decision problems, and can potentially be applied in other areas such as clinical trial design, control and economics.The emergence of new diseases, either naturally or as the result of a biological attack, is one of the most important threats to national security; early detection and adequate intervention are key to saving lives and minimizing the damage caused by such an outbreak.  However, early detection can be extremely difficult when symptoms are similar to those of diseases already endemic in the population (for example, fever and sore throats which are common symptoms of colds and influenza, are also symptoms of respiratory Anthrax), and a detailed analysis of the space-time patterns is necessary in order to be able to separate the presence of a new disease from the random fluctuations inherent to the dynamics of the preexisting disease.  Similarly, the design of interventions (vaccination, quarantine and culling, just to mention three possibilities) is impaired in this setting by the lack of knowledge about the infectiousness of the new disease and the efficacy of available vaccines.  This research develops new algorithms for disease monitoring and outbreak management under uncertainty that have the potential to greatly improve the ability of government and international agencies to identify and intervene in outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.',\n",

Little is known about the roles of these symbiotic bacteria and their contributions to the sponge and thereby indirectly to the coral reef ecosystem in which the sponges live.  The hypothesis driving the project is that diverse assemblages of nitrogen-fixing bacteria play an important role in providing sponges with nitrogen, taking nitrogen gas and converting it to organic forms of nitrogen that can be used by sponges.  The role of bacterial symbionts of two sponges from Key Largo, Florida, Ircinia strobilina and Mycale laxissima in nitrogen fixation will be determined.  The project will include biochemical approaches to demonstrate nitrogen fixation in whole sponges and bacterial isolates, and molecular approaches to study the pattern of where and when the nifH gene is turned on and makes the NifH protein, a key protein in nitrogen fixation. Training will be provided in marine microbiology to graduate students and undergraduate minority students will be encouraged to enter careers in scientific research by participating in a summer course in Marine Microbiology. The project will advance our understanding of microbial diversity and function in complex sponge symbioses, promoting the study of sponge symbioses as models of the complex symbiotic relationships found between microbes and many higher organisms.

       " \"Many decisions are made in the face of risk and uncertainty and under circumstances where each person's individual decision affects other people's outcomes. The 2009 outbreak of swine flu (influenza A H1N1) provides a chance to study how lay people's perceptions of risks change over time and how those perceptions drive willingness to engage in precautionary behaviors (such as anti-viral medication use or self quarantine) that not only have consequences for the person who engages in the behaviors but that also affect the risks for others in the population.  The investigators use an internet survey regarding people?s risk perception and willingness to take precautionary measures to query cohorts of US adults starting a few days after the first news of the outbreak and continuing at regular intervals throughout the epidemic. The research examines the relationships over time among information from the media about the influenza outbreak, perceptions of risk, and interest in taking precautionary measures. This outbreak of a new infectious disease represents a rare opportunity to study how risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors change over time in response to information about how the hazard unfolds.

Many changes in land use result in changes in the availability of more than one resource, thus, there is a need to better understand the potential interactions of simultaneously varying multiple resources on biofilm community composition. Experiments supported by this award will quantify the changes that occur in the composition and function of stream biofilm in response to varied resource gradients by manipulating N+P and carbon concentrations in experimental chambers. As landscapes are increasingly impacted by agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, understanding the response of stream ecosystems to nutrient loading will help predict nutrient retention and export capacity of surface waters. This research will identify how biofilm community interactions alter nutrient cycling and inform land managers of potential consequences of changes in land use.',\n",
       " 'CBET-0854684de FigueiredoMicrobial fuel cells are remarkable  green energy  devices that exploit microbes to generate electricity from organic compounds. These fuel cells have generated significant excitement in the bioenergy community because of their potential for powering diverse technologies, including waste water treatment, autonomous sensors for long-term operations in low accessibility regions, mobile robot/sensor platforms, and renewable energy systems. Unfortunately, current microbial fuel cells produce low amounts of power, a fact that has stymied widespread application of the technology. A better understanding of how microbes can generate electricity will significantly improve fuel cell performance.  In addition, new platforms that allow for microbial electricity production to be studied in a massively parallel fashion are essential to significantly advance the field. With these ideas in mind, a novel technology that can, in a massively parallel fashion, uncover how microbes generate electricity will be developed. In addition, a minority outreach and educational program that will train the next generation leaders in the bioenergy sciences will be pursued.  Taken together, these efforts will have far-reaching implications for the study of electricity generation by microbes, and the development of next generation microbial fuel cells.',\n",
       " 'Mercury is a global contaminant that affects humans through fish consumption and indirectly through adverse effects on  wildlife species. The organic form of mercury, methylmercury, is the most readily available form to the organisms making the production of methylmercury the most critical factor determining mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems. The ecosystem controls of methylmercury production in streams and rivers are poorly understood, however. The proposed research will investigate the rates and potential mechanisms mediating methylmercury production via filamentous algae, which may be functioning as ?hotspots? of rapid mercury transformations in rivers. Specifically, this research will examine whether the  production of methylmercury  is related to the growth stages of filamentous algae in a river ecosystem where hydrology, food web relationships and ecosystem processes are well characterized from previous studies. By measuring in-situ mercury methylation rates and manipulating both microbial and photosynthetic activities, this research will elucidate key ecological factors that mediate the role of filamentous algae in mercury transformations in natural rivers. The project integrates different scientific disciplines toward understanding a highly complex environmental issue - ecosystem mediation of mercury contamination. The proposed work will provide fundamental knowledge regarding the cycling of mercury in stream and river ecosystems. The new knowledge may allow the prediction of changes in availability of mercury to aquatic food webs in response to effects of altered land use such as forest clearing and nutrient enrichment. In addition, the proposed work will provide educational and research opportunities for a graduate student and undergraduate researchers through field sample collection and analyses. Lastly, the results from this proposed study will be widely disseminated through presentations in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals.',\n",
       " \"This dissertation project focuses on farmers' use of the legal system and other mechanisms to resolve disputes over how land should be managed in rural China. Land disputes have emerged as a major problem in rural China in recent years, commonly pitting local officials and developers against farmers in struggles over the handling of property rights in land. In attempting to resolve these disputes, farmers can avail themselves of an array of dispute resolution mechanisms, such as petition offices, arbitration committees, courts, and public hearings. This study investigates how farmers address  information deficits  about the relative effectiveness of these various mechanisms and why farmers choose certain dispute resolution mechanisms instead of others.  The primary methodology employed in this research is in-depth interviews, conducted over the course of nine months in two coastal provinces where land disputes are common.  These will be used to investigate how farmers view urbanization, land management, courts and other legal institutions, how much they know about relevant laws, and what factors they consider when choosing tactics to resolve disputes. Interviews also include questions designed to gather data on how farmers acquire information, including education, ties to lawyers, legal aid and exposure to legal stories in the media. In addition to interviews with farmers, interviews are conducted with other stakeholders, including academics, local government officials, lawyers and judges.  Although the choice of dispute resolution strategy is an important theoretical topic in the literature on law and society and social movements, it is rarely examined in the context of a non-democratic state with a developing legal system. Moreover, information environments remain understudied in the literature on tactical choice.  This study addresses both issues in the context of land management in rural China, contributing to the understanding of access to justice in non-democratic states that seek to implement the rule of law.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Support is requested to expand the existing four-story Laboratory Animal Facility (LAF) in the West Building of the Fox Chase Cancer Center by adding a four-floor wing onto the current facility. This addition of 25,290 gross square feet will add 12,910 net square feet of animal research space. Over 6000 square feet of space is utilized for air handling equipment which supports the combined new facility (old facility plus the proposed addition). This addition, combined with renovation of the existing facility (planned for 2006-2007) and increased use of high density microisolator cages (already begun), will increase the research mouse capacity to 25,600 cages. At our current and expected rate of use this expansion will satisfy the animal research needs of research investigators at FCCC until 2010.    Capabilities of the current centrally administered AAALAC accredited program in Philadelphia have been exceeded and much of the existing facility is overcrowded and lacks a secure microbiological barrier, placing studies at risk of being invalidated due to infections. The proposed addition will correct deficiencies in animal space, and provide a high quality mouse research barrier facility with space for expanding genomic services in a setting of stringent microbiological security. Located immediately adjacent to the existing facility, it will be able to utilize central cagewashing and support services. It will also add a small cagewash area for the basement woodchuck and duck area to better separate them from the barrier mouse research facilities. This expansion will provide:     -2,032 nsf of quarantine space for the health evaluation and rederivation of incoming mice.   -4,967 nsf of additional mouse holding rooms   -1,078 nsf of additional procedural laboratories   -additional cage washing and procedural areas for support to woodchuck and duck viral hepatitus studies   -autoclave, gowning and sterilization capability at the entry to each research mouse holding area    In addition to the above, the expansion will house mechanical space for the quarantine facility and air handling for the entire LAF. The campus is currently overdeveloped making available space for mechanical support equipment critical. Therefore, cooling towers will be located on the roof and are necessary for redundant chilled water capacity supporting the LAF. Rooftops become prime real estate for cooling towers to support this rapidly growing research complex.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     High-throughput analysis has become an essential tool in biomedical informatics and genomic research. One aspect of this research paradigm that has not been heavily examined is how errors generated in early stages of these analyses propagate through downstream analyses. For many complex, high-throughput analyses of genome data, sequence alignment is among the very first steps. Alignment results in a hypothesized set of site homologies; however, these hypotheses are often taken as fact and used in all subsequent analyses as if correct. It is well known that alignments become inaccurate as evolutionary divergence increases; how this error affects genome analyses in biomedical informatics is poorly understood. This proposal is a follow-up to a pilot study examining the use of computational sequence simulation to study the effects and propagation of alignment error on comparative and functional genomic sequence analysis. The specific aims of this study are (1) to more thoroughly examine the effect of alignment errors on phylogenetic accuracy; (2) to examine the accuracy of ancestral sequence reconstruction methods and see how errors in both alignment and phylogenetic hypothesis may affect these reconstructions; (3) to explore a novel approach for determining the composition of gene families which makes use of evolutionary principles, including phylogeny and ancestral sequence reconstruction; and (4) to improve a sequence simulation program to include (a) better insertion/deletion models, including those based on both theory and empirical data; (b) more realistic simulation options for RNA, coding DNA and protein sequences; (c) to allow full genome simulations, including segmental variation of mutation parameters and genome-scale processes; and (d) to extend the program for use on all major computational platforms, including Windows, Linux and Macintosh.',\n",

The revised goals are 1) improve and increase housing and testing space for rodents by creating a barrier facility within which all housing and testing of mice and rats will take place, and 2) provide better support facilities. The existing main animal care facility occupies two floors of the Kolb Research Building. Species are intermingled. In the new design, all mice and rats will be housed and tested on a single floor. Housing space will be increased by the elimination of two corridors. Eight new testing rooms will be created, most adjacent to the housing rooms. Thus many rodents will not have to be carried through common corridors to and from testing rooms. There will be two new surgery/procedure rooms: one for mice, one for rats. The quarantine capabilities for importation of mice will be greatly expanded. The proposed renovations are the first step in a long term plan to create a state-of-the-art, expanded animal facility on the top three floors of the research building. The design will meet all government guidelines for the care of laboratory animals and safety regulations for staff.

The RIQS facility would provide a currently unavailable specialized space to isolate and rederive diseased or suspect animals to produce disease-free offspring via embryo transfer to clean foster mothers. RIQS features include: separate Quarantine (dirty) and Rederivation (clean) Suites; separation via airlock from other parts of the building, including separate entrance and exit doors to the  dirty  suite; filtration of both incoming and outgoing air; card coded locks on all doors; a pass-through for tissues; descending room pressurization from clean to dirty areas; carding procedures to prevent personnel from entering clean vivaria after entering the RIQS. RIQS will allow PHS-funded researchers to safely bring valuable strains of genetically engineered mice to UCI for rederivation, a practice stopped in 2006 due to disease. RIQS allows for the use of specialized practices (e.g. barrier maintenance) to protect valuable genetically engineered breeding stock, the quality of research data, and a significant campus and NCRR previous investment in animal facility space, especially for mice. A new ULAR policy will require all genetically engineered mice to be used for breeding be rederived into the new barrier space.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to develop new mathematical models of infectious disease transmission that effectively, capture the impact of stochasticity on dynamics and lead to more effective control. The group will study the dynamics of disease spread in fluctuating environments modeled at various population scales. First, the group will develop a new class of stochastic metapopulation models for disease spread, noting the importance of stochastic effects in the dynamics. These models capture new types of solutions that cannot be realized in deterministic models, such as disease extinction. The group proposes to develop new mathematical and computational methods for designing and analyzing this class of models. The group will also model various delivery schedules of vaccines into populations. By assuming limited resources, such as constrained vaccine supply or quarantine-type contact control, the results from these models will lead to practical solutions for experimentalists and poUcy makers. The project will lead to greater insight into the mechanisms that allow a disease to successfully propagate in a population, as well as new mathematical tools to analyze stochastic systems. In our long term vision for this project, the group will contribute new mathematical tools to the field of epidemiology. These tools will be motivated by improved models of real world problems, which lead to better ways to design optimization methods. Our work is driven by real epidemiological threats, is derived from data collected from around the world, and is focused on answering questions that could save lives. There is an excitement about the impact of interdisciplinary research efforts combining mathematical fields, such as nonlinear analysis, stochastic d3Tiamics, and network theory, with systems biology approaches such as population dynamics, epidemiology, and immunology. This proposal describes ways in which modeling can open new research directions in all of these fields.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addressed Broad Challenge Area: (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation and specific challenge topic: 03-AT-101* Psychoneuroimmunology biomarkers of stress. Identification of biomarkers to assess the impact of stress, both social and biological, on immune function. The rate of cell senescence in lymphocytes (particularly in CD8 cells), as indicated by decreases in telomere length, may be an important new marker of immunocompetence and, in turn, host resistance to infectious agents. Loss of telomere length may be especially important in understanding the role of psychological stress in infectious illness. Stress is associated with greater susceptibility to upper respiratory viral illnesses. In addition, increases in psychological stress are associated with shorter telomere length in lymphocytes. This evidence suggests that stress may influence disease susceptibility via its effects on lymphocyte cell senescence. Moreover, psychological stress has also been associated with greater oxidative stress and less telomerase activity. Both of these contribute to shortening of telomeres, suggesting that psychological stress may shorten telomeres via its effects on these telomere regulators. We have a unique opportunity to address these hypotheses in healthy adult human subjects by adding assessments of oxidative stress, telomerase activity and telomere length at baseline to an ongoing viral- challenge study. Baseline measures in the parent study include a range of stress measures: psychological and social measures of stress by questionnaire, assessments of basal diurnal cortisol rhythms over three days and of autonomic and cortisol response to an experimental stressor in the laboratory. After completing all baseline measures, subjects are exposed to a safety tested rhinovirus and monitored in quarantine for the development of infection and illness. Local (nasal secretory) release of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines are also assessed after viral exposure. Approximately 40% of the subjects develop a clinical illness in response to the viral challenge. In this extension of that study, we propose to evaluate whether telomere length predicts susceptibility to infection and disease expression and whether it constitutes a mediating pathway through which stress influences resistance to infectious disease. We can also determine whether or not telomere length mediates the known effects of psychological stress on the locally produced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in illness expression. Finally, we can test whether or not telomerase activity and oxidative stress constitute pathways through which psychological, social and biological markers of stress might influence telomere length. This work has implications for understanding the role of stress in the aging process and particularly important implications for reducing disease in the elderly and those experiencing long-term stress (e.g. the chronically unemployed, caregivers, and those suffering from poverty).     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A major focus of the project is to determine whether immune cell senescence (as assessed by telomere length) plays an important role in our ability to fight off infection. Because life stress has been found to be associated with greater senescence, we are also testing whether stress-associated increases in senescence can account for why life stress increases our risk for infectious diseases. An in-depth understanding of the role how stress influences our health can help lead to effective interventions to protect people at risk.',\n",
       " \"Prospective Studies of Avian Influenza Transmission in Asia The H5N1 avian influenza epidemic that has ravaged multiple species in Asia, now threatens the UnitedStates. National response plans call for aggressive human case identification, antiviral use, isolation, andpossibly quarantine. The mathematical models upon which the pandemic plans rely lack fundamentalobjective data such as transmission rates and virus infectiousness. As human disease detection in Asia isbased upon clinical encounters, little is known regarding subclinical infections or risk factors for H5N1infection. Our long term goa/in this proposed research is to epidemiologically describe clinical andsubclinical H5N1 transmission such that public health officials might design appropriate H5N1 surveillanceand control measures. In this effort we will conduct a controlled, three-year, prospective study of H5N1 transmission among 900adults occupationally exposed to poultry (poultry farmers, poultry industry workers, meat processing workers,open poultry market workers), and 300 age-group and gender matched non-exposed controls living in threeH5N1 endemic areas in Asia: Tangerang, Indonesia; Bali, Indonesia; and Kandaal Province, Cambodia. Thestudy will involve aggressive active surveillance for influenza-like illness among study participants (withnasopharyngeal swab and serum sampling), annual serial serological follow-up of participants, and throughhome visits, similar studies of the family members exposed to study subjects who develops influenzainfection. Microneutralization serologic techniques, RT-PCR, and viral culture will be used to determineinfluenza infection outcomes. Our objectives are to determine the seroprevalence of evidence of previousH5N1 influenza infection, to estimate the annual incidence of H5N1 influenza infection, to estimatesecondary H5N1 influenza infection rates, and to determine risk factors for H5N1 influenza infection. Basedupon preliminary data, our central hypotheses are that H5N1 influenza infection will be frequent among theseworkers, that we will be able to estimate the prevalence and incidence of H5N1 infection, and that we will beable to identify persons at highest risk of H5N1 infection. We are particularly well-suited to conduct this work as we have extensive experience conducting bothepidemiological and laboratory-based studies of influenza transmission, and we have exceptionalcooperation among public health officials nationally and locally at the field sites. This study is innovative inthat no such prospective studies of avian influenza infection have been performed among those person'soccupationally exposed to poultry in H5N1 endemic sites.\",\n",

It has been estimated that in approximately 50% of cases, the etiology of diarrhea is undetermined.  The purpose of this resource-related research project proposal is to examine the role of selected, recently recognized and/or under-diagnosed causes of GI disease in the TNPRC rhesus breeding colonies and to develop intervention strategies that can be applied toward the long-term goal of reducing morbidity in rhesus macaques at the TNPRC.  To begin to achieve these goals, the specific aims are; 1) Determine the prevalence and incidence of selected, recently recognized and/or under-diagnosed infectious causes of GI disease in rhesus macaques at the TNPRC to evaluate their association and risk with GI disease.  The agents will include bacteria (Campylobacter), viruses (calicivirus and rotavirus), and the enteric parasitic microsporidia.  2) Evaluate the association between dietary gluten sensitivity in relation to GI disease, immune status, and demographic factors.  These infectious agents (species or genotypes) and dietary sensitivity are currently not included on the routine diagnostic protocols provided by the core service laboratories at the TNPRC but have been recently recognized as probable contributors to overall morbidity attributable to GI disease in NHPs at the TNPRC.  3) Develop intervention strategies for reducing the incidence of GI disease.  Prevalence, clinical, and demographic data generated in aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated by statistical analyses to measure risk factors associated with GI disease.  Prevalence data will be based on the detection of the selected agents suspected of contributing to GI disease.  The clinical data will primarily include occurrence of diarrhea, weight loss, and fever.  Demographic information will include age, gender, body weight, housing conditions (location, field cage size, population size, female:male ratio), seasonality, and medical history (previous clinical admissions and cause, pregnancy outcomes).  The results will be used to generate intervention strategies or algorithms that subsequently can be applied in future studies to test proof of concept.  Predicted strategies include the implementation of new protocols in the TNPRC diagnostic core laboratories, selectivity in treatment, modification of sanitation procedures, relocation or limited quarantine of affected animals, dietary changes, and changes in animal husbandry practices.  The outcome of this study is expected to improve the resource value of the NHPs that are used as models to study human disease.',\n",

Furthermore, the individual units interact with the other divisions to fulfill the goals of the entire Center.  A.\\tVeterinary Services UnitThe Veterinary Services Unit of the WNPRC employs six veterinarians and seven veterinary technicians.   The principal objective of the unit is to provide consistent and excellent care to the NHP colonies housed at the WNPRC.  To achieve this objective, the unit has created and implemented a collection of policies that guide the provision of veterinary care at the WNPRC.  These policies, which encompass pertinent topics such as quarantine, preventative medicine, and clinical/surgical care, are based on the most contemporary techniques available to NHP veterinarians.  The second major objective of the unit is to provide support for the investigators performing research at the WNPRC.  The primary way in which the unit supports the investigators is by ensuring a consistent supply of healthy NHPs is available for utilization in experimental studies.  The veterinary staff also assists investigators by meeting with them prior to an experiment to discuss and plan for each proposed grant and study, by helping compose IACUC protocols, by performing procedures beyond the skill level of the investigators, and by providing clinical care for the NHPs assigned to research projects.The final objective of the unit is to provide training for personnel working with NHPs at the WNPRC and at other institutions.  Through didactic and applied instruction, the unit provides training to veterinary and veterinary technical students, visiting veterinarians and veterinary technicians, WNPRC and visiting investigators, and scientific support staff.The Veterinary Services Unit works closely with the other units of the Animal Services Division as well other divisions of the WNPRC.

Colony Records staff also assure the quality control of data entries, train new staff on how to use the Animal Records Database, and perform database queries.  The subunit is appropriately situated in the Colony Management unit to foster frequent communication among personnel performing the work being documented.  The unit works closely with the Information Services Division of the WNPRC to continuously improve the Internet-based version of the Colony Records Database and to facilitate and simplify the data entry and retrieval process.D.\\tBehavioral Management Unit The Behavioral management Unit employs a coordinator, two full-time assistants and on student. The Behavioral Management staff utilizes a combination of environmental enrichment, behavior modification, and positive reinforcement, in attempt to promote a diverse array of species typical behaviors in the captive NHPs, increase each animal's control and utilization of their environment, and decrease the occurrence of stereotypical and self-injurious behavior. The Environmental Enrichment Plan remains unchanged from last year.  This plan consists of the following components:  + Social companionship+ Foraging+ Food enrichment+ Human to non-human interaction+ Structural enrichment+ Manipulanda + Additional sensory stimulation  Each component of the enrichment plan has been designed to work in unison with the other components to create a comfortable and psychologically challenging environment for the NHPs.E.\\tCompliance and Training Unit The Compliance and Training Unit employs a Compliance Coordinator, a Training Coordinator, a part-time Training Assistant, and a part-time Laboratory Safety Coordinator.  Compliance and Training is a multi-dimensional unit with a variety of responsibilities.  The primary objectives of the unit are to train all personnel at the WNPRC who may come in contact with NHPs or their tissue; to ensure that the WNPRC facilities and personnel remain compliant with all animal welfare regulations; to assist investigators in the development of IACUC protocols; and to guide the Occupational Health and Safety Program of the Center.  Since its inception in 2005, the unit has worked in collaboration with the various divisions and investigators of the WNPRC to standardize training and promote a center-wide atmosphere of regulatory compliance and safety.F.\\tPathology Services UnitThe Pathology Services Unit employs two part-time Veterinary Pathologists, a full-time Hematologist/Laboratory Safety Coordinator, and two full-time research assistants.  The unit is currently engaged in a nationwide search for another veterinary pathologist.  The Pathology Services unit has been an integral part of the WNPRC since it's inception. Pathology services has two main functions 1) to support nonhuman primate colony health and the clinical veterinary staff by providing rapid diagnoses of disease and 2) to support all research projects at the WNPRC that involve terminal procedures, surgical biopsies and/or clinical pathology. Complete gross necropsies are performed on all animals, whether they are euthanized for clinical reasons, die spontaneously, or are euthanized for experimental purposes.  Tissues from these animals receive complete histopathological examinations, except when the examination of a specific tissue is incompatible with experimental protocols. The tissue distribution program provides primate tissue to investigators affiliated with WNPRC, the University of Wisconsin, other academic institutions, and private industry. A comprehensive tissue library of both rhesus macaque and common marmoset tissues is maintained for both retrospective and prospective studies.G. Allocation of Resource AccessThe Animal Services Division works closely with the Centralized Protocol Implementation Unit and the WNPRC Executive Committee to review all requests for access to the Center's nonhuman primate colonies.  Equitable decisions are made by these three entities to ensure that all PIs have access to the nonhuman primates they require for their IACUC-approved experimental protocols.Pathology Services notifies investigators of the resource via the Primate Center website, scientific meetings, and through the nonhuman primate biological materials distribution program. To date, no requests have been denied.  All core WNPRC labs use Pathology Services at some point in their projects, and numerous campus affiliates avail of this service.  In addition, since May 1, 2008, 12 investigators from non-host institutions received a total of 140 samples, representing tissues, organs and genetic material from Macaca mulatta, Macaca fasicularis, and Callithrix jacchus. Please see the Research Services section of this progress report for a table of species, specimen types and numbers.H. DisseminationThe Associate Director of Animal Services strives to ensure that important information discovered or developed by the division is disseminated to the greater scientific community through publication in peer-reviewed journals and at national meetings.  We request that projects utilizing any divisional services acknowledge the service in manuscripts and presentations. Animal Services personnel also lecture regularly on nonhuman primate topics to WNPRC staff, and to veterinary residents and students on campus. One unit member presented a short outreach program to a local Girl Scout troop that involved the creation of enrichment toys for animals and a follow-up meeting so that the children could see the results of their work. Another unit member, one of the veterinarians, gave several talks to visiting school groups at the Primate Center in FY2008-2009.I. Progress and HighlightsVeterinary Services - In 2008, the Veterinary Services Unit fulfilled their three main objectives (animal care, research support, and training) admirably.  The unit was pivotal in the success of site visits performed by the USDA and AAALAC.  The unit also provided training for 9 vet tech students, 14 vet students, 4 WNPRC investigators, and 6 veterinary personnel from facilities outside of the WNPRC.  The surgical subunit of Veterinary Services provided support for 197 surgical procedures.  Members of the Veterinary Services Unit also presented lectures at two national meeting in 2008. Colony Services  In addition to daily husbandry responsibilities the personnel of the Colony Services Unit provided a pivotal service for the Veterinary Unit and the investigators of the WNPRC.  In 2008, the unit cleaned greater than 400,000 cages, administered 19,000 treatments, and collected 5,840 blood samples.Behavioral Management - The Behavioral Management Unit continues to develop their overall program from simply providing environmental enrichment and pairing animals to generating true academic output that is relevant to the field of nonhuman primate behavior.  In 2008, the unit has expanded its environmental enrichment program for marmosets, standardized the behavioral assessment program, incorporated more behavioral data into the colony records database, provided approximately 98,000 enrichment opportunities for the colony, and has presented data at the annual meet of the American Society of Primatologists.Compliance and Training - With the addition of a part-time Laboratory Safety Coordinator in 2008, the Compliance and Training Unit continued to focus on the improvement of laboratory safety training, general safety training, appropriate responses to emergency situations, and hands on training for research staff with husbandry and animal handling duties.  Other accomplishments included providing refresher training in basic biosafety to all laboratory staff and the provision of Laboratory Training Notebooks to all principal investigators.  In 2008, nearly all standard operating procedures were carefully re-evaluated and revised to be more specific with their content, and an effective electronic verification form was developed to ensure compliance with review of revised SOPs. The unit provided training regarding occupational health information for 390 people working with NHPs.  The individuals trained were from a variety of occupational backgrounds including media, custodial staff, maintenance personnel, vendors, police officers, national/international visitors, students and new employees.  Additionally, the unit performed 45 protocol pre-reviews for investigators in 2008. Pathology Services - The unit has continued to function smoothly during 2008. Unit members have participated in and rotationally hosted the monthly virtual slide conference for Primate Pathology.  One pathologist presented a talk at the annual American College of Veterinary Pathologists (ACVP) meeting.  In 2008, the unit was awarded responsibility for the collection, inventory, and dissemination of samples for the NIH Aged Nonhuman Primate Tissue Bank.  In 2008 Pathology Unit members provided training in specialized NHP necropsy procedures to campus pathologists, investigators, multiple consultations on NHP cases. Unit members also provided preparatory training for the American College of Veterinary Pathologists certifying examination to four pathology residents on campus.Publications note: Animal Services support is involved in practically every journal article that depends in part or in full on WNPRC resources.Note: AIDS related\",\n",

       " \"Cattle fever ticks carry two different pathogens that cause cattle fever in cattle. Cattle fever was eradicated from the United States in the first half of the twentieth century by eliminating these ticks. However, cattle fever and cattle fever ticks are still common in Mexico and hundreds of thousands of cattle are imported annually from Mexico into the U.S. Cattle fever ticks are only prevented from returning to the U.S. by rigorous enforcement of a permanent quarantine buffer zone along the Mexico-U.S. border, maintained by the USDA-Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as part of the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP). Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cattle fever ticks found both within the buffer zone and within the supposed `tick-free' area. Historically, cattle fever ticks were considered to only feed on cattle. Whether deer can sustain populations of cattle fever ticks, enabling more widespread tick movements, has been a subject of debate. The recent identification of cattle fever in free-ranging white-tailed deer in the Mexican states bordering Texas has brought this debate to the forefront again, because deer may negatively impact current efforts to control the re-introduction and spread of cattle fever and cattle fever ticks in the U.S. The overall, long-term goal of this project is to better understand the factors that affect the occurrence and movement of cattle fever and cattle fever ticks in and near the USDA permanent cattle fever quarantine zone in Texas. We will: 1) Determine if cattle fever ticks are permanently established in and near the Texas quarantine zone and/or are regularly moved into this region from infested regions outside the quarantine zone, 2) Determine if cattle fever ticks on deer serve as a source for cattle fever and cattle fever ticks found on cattle in the Texas quarantine zone, and 3) Determine how widespread cattle fever and cattle fever ticks are in the Texas quarantine zone. We will use DNA fingerprinting analysis of the ticks to provide fundamental information about the movement of cattle fever ticks within the permanent quarantine zone, where these ticks originally came from, and whether they are found on both cattle and deer in similar numbers. We will use DNA fingerprinting analysis of the pathogens that cause cattle fever to understand how they are distributed in the quarantine zone, as well as how they interact with the ticks, cattle, and deer. The rationale behind this study is to generate the needed data and knowledge to improve upon existing efforts to prevent the spread of cattle fever and cattle fever ticks within the US. The results of this study will provide the scientific framework for devising improved and environmentally sound management strategies for these pests. Further, we will develop a suite of DNA fingerprinting tools that can be used in the future to quickly detect and analyze unknown strains of cattle fever and new populations of cattle fever ticks, providing information that can be used to pinpoint the likely source of these materials.\",\n",
       " 'Humans have doubled natural inputs of mineral nitrogen to terrestrial Earth, and these inputs are accelerating. Greater than 1/3 of this human-derived nitrogen reaches surface and ground waters, creating significant environmental problems such as the hypoxic zones in the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico and the pollution of drinking waters. The vast majority of mineral nitrogen inputs travel through the soil prior to reaching surface and ground waters. Processing of these inputs is complex. Mineral nitrogen transformation in the soil can be affected by soil organic carbon: High soil organic carbon levels can promote the transformation of mineral nitrogen into relatively stable, organic compounds. Mineral nitrogen transport through unsaturated soils to surface and groundwaters can be affected by soil water flowpaths: Some flowpaths can enhance mineral nitrogen retention, while other flowpaths can facilitate its transport to ground and surface waters. This research will simultaneously examine mechanisms that transform and transport mineral nitrogen as it travels from surface soils to ground and surface waters. Taking advantage of cross-ecosystem comparisons, properties that lead to the retention of mineral nitrogen within soil and transport of mineral nitrogen through the soil will be identified. Paired field observation and laboratory manipulation experiments will be used to understand how microscopic biogeochemical processes contribute to ecosystem-scale patterns. Data collected will be published and is expected to contribute to improved ecosystem management and modeling efforts.',\n",
       " 'Severe economic losses due to cattle fever ticks and babesiosis were estimated at $130.5 million U.S. (equivalent to $3 billion in 2009) in 1906 (Hagan and Bruner, 1951; Hardwood et al., 1979). Direct effects included mortality and morbidity in affected cattle herds, lost production (milk/meat), and expenses associated with rigorous acaracide treatments. According to USDA, APHIS in 2006 there were 46 premises under quarantine. The number of CFT outbreaks within and outside the permanent quarantine zone fluctuates with time. A significant incursion of CFT took place in the 1970s. Of a total of 170 outbreaks recorded in 1973, 112 occurred outside of the permanent quarantine zone.The largest number of infested premises in the permanent quarantine zone was initially recorded in 2005, but that record was broken again in 2008 when CFT were detected in 85 premises. A sustained spillover of CFT into the free zone also has been noted since 2004. In June 2009 the number of CFT outbreaks outside the permanent quarantine surpassed the total in 2008. Zapata and Starr are the counties most affected in South Texas (Hillman 2009). Outcomes: Knowledge of the importance of ungulate wildlife in the maintenance of populations of cattle fever ticks and tick-borne disease agents is vital for assessing risks and devising management strategies to ensure the effectiveness of the CFTEP and thereby protect the U. S. and Mexico cattle industry. Bovine babesiosis causes important economic loss in most countries, where it is endemic, mainly due to the high morbidity and mortality in susceptible cattle herds. Economical losses are measured based on low weight gain, reduction in milk production, abortion, the cost of treatments, and mortality. However, few controlled studies have been carried out to determine the exact annual loss caused by babesiosis in a country. If re-introduced throughout the southern U.S., the ticks and the cattle fever organisms that they carry could have severe adverse economic effect on the beef and dairy industries in the U.S. from southwest Texas to Virginia, as well as in southern California (Graham and Hourrigan 1977). Savings to the U.S. livestock industry due to the eradication of these tick vectors were estimated to be one-half to one billion dollars annually (Graham and Hourrigan 1977; McCosker 1981). Failure to keep CFT eradicated will result in the infestation of U.S. cattle populations, along with tick-borne disease. Assessment of this risk indicates that such situation will have a devastating effect on a fully susceptible national bovine herd. We will identify properties that have been quarantined because of the detection of CFT in them. We will capture up to 30 WTD per site. Blood samples will be taken from each deer and all ticks found on the deer will be collected. At low-fenced sites - 10 deer (equal numbers of males and females) on each of the sites will be fitted with collars At the high-fenced site ~ 30 WTD will be captured at the beginning of the study followed by recapturing 15 WTD after 4.5 months and 9 months to determine tick population (with a total of 3 captures in February, July, and November).',\n",

       " 'Laurel wilt kills American members of the laurel plant family (Lauraceae), including the most important crop in the family, avocado. Unknown before 2003, laurel wilt has invaded much of the southeastern seaboard of the US. It began to eliminate backyard/homeowner avocado trees in Florida in 2007, and currently threatens commercial production of the crop that is centered in Miami-Dade County (overall impact of $54 million yr-1) and valuable accessions in the National Germplasm Repository in Miami (USDA-ARS Subtropical Horticultural Research Station). Major (California, $342 million in 2006) and minor commerce in the fruit (Texas, Hawaii and Puerto Rico) are threatened elsewhere in the US and in the neighboring tropics. Mexico is the world?s #1 producer, a center of origin for the crop, and a significant source of fruit for packing houses in California. Laurel wilt was first recognized on an avocado relative, redbay, which is a dominant component of Coastal Plain forest communities in the southeastern US; it is largely on this species that the disease has spread. With this movement, other related native species have succumbed including sassafras, swamp bay, spice bush, the rare pondspice, and the critically endangered pondberry; the last two species are now threatened with extinction. Inoculation tests and natural outbreaks of the disease indicate that Old World members of the family are also affected, but that American species are most susceptible. Laurel wilt is vectored by an invasive ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus. X. glabratus was known in the Indian subcontinent and Orient before it was detected in 2002 in Port Wentworth, a seaport near Savannah, GA. Ambrosia beetles are commonly dispersed in wood pallet material and effectively invade new locations due to their small size and wide host ranges. Laurel wilt is caused by a previously unknown fungal symbiont of X. glabratus, Raffaelea lauricola, which was first described in 2008. Although R. lauricola is thought to have moved to the US with its beetle host there are no reports of its presence, or of laurel wilt, in the Old World. Significant gaps exist in what is known about laurel wilt and the ways in which this agricultural and ecological threat should be regulated, interdicted and managed. This project will: develop resistant avocado genotypes; identify host or other cues that attract the insect; examine interactions of R. lauricola with resistant and susceptible plants; determine environmental conditions that influence the insect?s colonization of host plants; examine the extent to which California bay would affect the development and spread of laurel wilt on avocado should the disease enter California; examine other related plants as hosts of the insect and pathogen; study disease movement in agricultural and natural ecosystems; quantify the economic impact of the disease, and the cost-effectiveness of existing or proposed control measures; and develop educational and extension materials for local, state and national stakeholders and to assist quarantine and mitigation efforts.',\n",
       " 'The U.S potato industry had farm-level sales of nearly $4 billion in 2008, and constitutes a vital segment of American agriculture. However, the economic sustainability of this industry is threatened by a new emerging disease named Zebra Chip (ZC). Zebra Chip affects all market classes of potato, such as the potato chip, fresh market, and French fry industries, by reducing both yield and quality. It was first identified in the US from Texas in 2000, but now has been detected in several other major potato production regions across the US. It is imperative to identify the major factors that impact disease incidence, severity, and spread, and to develop research and educational programs that will help producers deal with this new threat. Containment of the disease is especially important since Korea recently placed a quarantine on importation of potatoes from areas where Zebra Chip is present, an act that quickly could escalate into a cascade of countries placing restrictions on importation of US potatoes Specific deliverables of this project will include 1) Best management practices (BMP) for ZC, 2) A ZC risk assessment/disease forecasting model to trigger BMP, 3) Germplasm with tolerance to ZC, 4) an Economic cost/benefit analysis and economic models for best case/worst case scenarios, 5) Publications, and educational and training programs dealing with all aspects of ZC, and 6) Dependable scientific data that will be useful to US regulatory agencies in development of a Pest Risk Assessment for ZC, which will be needed to address the recent Korean quarantine on US potatoes. These deliverables will directly impact and enhance environmental quality through more controlled and targeted pesticide application, economic sustainability for potato producers and processors, and overall consumer confidence in the safety and quality of US potatoes and potato products.',\n",
       " \"Situation: Knowledge of plant pathogenic fungi biodiversity is an important issue in Puerto Rico's fragile agricultural ecosystem and fundamental when dealing with exotic plant diseases of quarantine importance. Damaging fungal pathogens such as the powdery mildews are responsible for major epidemics through the history, and have been placed at the top list of plant diseases of economic importance worldwide. They are obligate parasites, easily recognized by their symptoms on the surface of plant tissues but limited knowledge of their taxonomy; misconceptions of their reproductive biology (i.e., usually considered host specific pathogens); and major phytosanitary issues based on their ability to become invasive across international borders, as they are usually not easily detected in cuttings or other propagative plant materials during quarantine inspections, make them an important group to study. Until recently, their taxonomy was based on teleomorphic characters or sexual stages, rarely found in the tropics thus making accurate identifications unfeasible. In fact, plant disease literature is characterized by hundreds of reports of powdery mildews identified only as Oidium sp. Recent taxonomic studies in Europe, Australia and Japan have focused in resolving the generic Oidium issue by using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and molecular biology tools (i.e. specific nucleotide sequences of the rDNA ITS region). Purpose: We propose to apply aforementioned techniques, in conjunction with host range data to establish a data base of correct identified anamorphic powdery mildews occurring in the island. This step is crucial not only when dealing with exotic plant diseases of quarantine importance but when breeding for resistance and when establishing effective integrated pest control programs.\",\n",
       " \"Four facets of Hawaii agriculture have been identified based on critical issues facing their respective industries that contribute $169 million to the state's economy: macadamia nuts and sapindaceous tropical fruits, swine production, and floriculture. Preventing macadamia nut quick decline, where trees die within 2-3 months after initial yellowing and browning of leaves occur, is not fully understood. Hawaii has the potential to be a major supplier of tropical fruits; however, a consistent supply, reliable production methods and management practices are of paramount importance to achieving that potential. The livestock industry in Hawai`i has dramatically changed in the past decade due to many factors, including stricter waste management regulations. The requirement of zero pest tolerance to meet quarantine requirements in floriculture often necessitates use of extreme pest control methods that may pose higher risks to human health and the environment in order to ensure a cost benefit (i.e., no rejected export shipments). The purpose of the Hawaii IPM Program is to address these issues by demonstrating the most efficacious protocols available to date that also provide long-term benefits of reduced risk to human health and to the environment, and overall economics, and to measure the impact of our methods of delivery (field day and demonstrations, field guide and other publications) on adoption by our stakeholders.\",\n",
       " 'Armored scale insects include many destructive pests of orchard crops, forestry, horticulture, and agriculture, causing an estimated $2 billion damage per year. Armored scales have an extraordinary tendency to be invasive. Of the 110 armored scale pest species in the US, 88 (80%) are imported from abroad, and a new serious pest species arrives every few years. Armored scale insects are often found on plant material in quarantine. Identifying them is a challenge, and our preliminary data suggests that there may be many cryptic species (species that look very similar and that cannot currently be told apart). This project brings together key personnel in state and federal agencies who identify potentially threatening armored scale insects, in a collaboration with the leading molecular laboratory devoted to studying armored scale diversity. The project has 3 objectives: (1) improved accuracy of species-level identification of intercepted armored scale insects, (2) discovery of cryptic species of invasive armored scale insects, and (3) discovery of the global sources of genetic diversity within invasive armored scale species. Specimens intercepted in plant quarantine will be subject to joint morphological/molecular voucher preparation: that is, each specimen from which DNA is extracted will be slide-mounted for conventional identification, with a permanent link between the DNA sequence and the specimen from which it was obtained. Three different genetic loci will be sequenced from each specimen. Molecular identification of an unknown specimen will be based on its DNA match (at all 3 genetic loci) to expertly-identified specimens in the voucher collection. Identification of new species will be based on uniqueness at all three loci. In the next few decades, routine DNA sequencing of unknown samples is likely to become practical for plant quarantine stations, an innovation that could revolutionize plant biosecurity. This project creates essential bioinformatic infrastructure that will enable reliable interpretation of those sequences.',\n",

       " \"Estimates over the last 20 years indicate that plant-parasitic nematodes cause up to14 percent annual yield loss among the world's major crops. In economic terms, these losses translate annually to at least $8 billion in the US. In addition, economic loss associated with increasing costs of nematicides and economic loss associated with trade embargos due to actual or suspected quarantine status nematode infestations exacerbate nematode problems. Widely-used and efficacious nematicides will be unavailable or greatly restricted in the future. The agricultural production community (our stakeholders) is scrambling to find viable and agro-ecologically sustainable alternatives to chemical-based nematode control. In addition, world travel and commerce have accelerated the dissemination of pest species, including plant nematodes. Development and application of new diagnostic protocols for accurate identification of nematode species is beneficial and necessary for national and international regulatory and quarantine agencies relative to free trade and economics. This project addresses these needs directly for the cyst, root-knot and other important nematodes. Understanding genetic variability and adaptation in nematodes is important for effective nematode management strategies that involve rotation, host plant resistance, cultural manipulations and biological control, because they are influenced directly by genetic variability existing in target nematode field populations. Results from current work indicate that genetic variability and adaptation potential in nematode populations are responsible for the aberrant results of many experiments assessing resistance, crop rotations, host ranges, cover/trap cropping, and biological control. Standard field, greenhouse and laboratory experiments will be used to characterize genetic and biological variation in nematodes relevant to crop production and trade; to determine nematode adaptation processes to crop hosts, agro-ecosystems and environments; to develop and assess nematode management strategies in agricultural production systems; and to implement rapid information transfer of project results to stakeholders. Several outcomes and impacts are anticipated from this project: implementation of new nematode management tactics that reduce pesticide usage, and thereby benefit human health and the environment; promotion of sustainable farm management practices through new nematode management strategies; increased knowledge base in plant-nematode biology and genetics for use in identifying novel targets for nematode control; economic benefits to producers and consumers through reduction in nematode management costs and food production; and more efficient and effective response and mitigation capabilities for invasive and trade product contamination issues.\",\n",
       " 'Potato cyst nematodes (Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis) are severe pathogens of potato that can cause substantial loss in yield. They are considered quarantine pests by most countries and potatoes for export or seed cannot be grown in or near fields where PCN has been found. Currently, in the western US any field in which PCN is found is not allowed to grow potatoes. Recently, a new species of Globodera was found which closely resembles PCN but is not G. pallida or G. rostochiensis. It is important to learn more about this nematode so that if it is found in surveys of potato fields it is not mistaken for PCN and cause unnecessary quarantine of fields. Columbia root-knot nematode, CRKN (Meloidogyne chitwoodi) is a serious pathogen of potato in much of the western US and infects tubers to produce quality defects that can cause entire crops to be rejected. CRKN is considered a quarantined pest by many countries and no shipments with even a single CRKN infested tuber are allowed entry. Tobacco rattle virus is vectored into potato by stubby-root nematodes and causes corky ringspot disease which also produces quality defects that can cause crop rejection. During this project, effects of environment, rotation crops and cover crops on suppression of nematode damage will be examined to improve management options that require less pesticide use and increase profitability. Strategies that are adequate for commercial potato sales where some level of nematode damage is permissible will be delineated from strategies necessary to obtain nematode-free standards required for seed or export.',\n",

       " \"Identification insect and related arthropod pests, including newly introduced species, is a critical first step in risk assessment and determining the need for quarantine procedures and new management strategies. The same technologies that serve the needs of collection based systematic research projects also serve the agricultural community by providing an information infrastructure for tracking and documenting pest species distributions, and predicting ecological associations in new areas of occurrence. Even in well studied areas such as eastern U.S., species that turn out to be new to science are discovered. In these cases the species' relationships, as determined through taxonomic study, are useful in predicting biological associations, including host plants and other aspects of natural history. This project will provide essential support roles to agricultural scientists by providing technical expertise for identifying species from difficult species complexes (e.g., Mexican rice borer) or novel technical descriptions of undescribed life history stages (e.g., first description of first instar larvae of the important biocontrol lady beetle, Diomus terminatus). All of these types of studies involve investigations of life histories that are key to understanding potential risks and benefits of new or inadequately studied species. Inventory research under this project will enhance understanding of ecological associations in forested and coastal ecosystems of the southeastern U.S. Specific area of investigation include beetles associated with dead wood substrates in Louisiana and the southern Appalacian Mountains, beetles of Great Smoky Mountians National Park, and insects associated with Spartina grass marshlands in coastal Louisiana. These studies will provide useful baseline data for understanding the value of dead wood in these forests and the potential impacts of insects on management of Spartina in coastal restoration initiatives. Specialized systematic research under this project will provide training to a new generation of insect systematists and document novel findings about the global diversity of inadequately studied insect taxa, their phylogenetic relationships, and historical biogeography.\",\n",
       " \"We have imported a new braconid parasitoid from Africa, Fopius caudatus, that successfully attacks the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata) in Hawaii. We currently have the only laboratory colony of this parasitoid in the world. While we have begun the necessary studies to obtain release permits for this species throughout the islands, the process for obtaining permits in Hawaii has become increasingly onerous, and additional quarantine testing is required. (Our efforts to obtain State permits for the previously imported parasitoid Fopius ceratitivorus are now entering their third year). This project will focus exclusively on obtaining sufficient biological data in quarantine in order to get necessary State and Federal permits to release Fopius caudatus in the field for improved biological control of medfly. Having learned from our previous efforts with F. ceratitivorus, and building upon a solid base of preliminary biological studies already conducted, we will obtain additional host range data and conduct a risk analysis for F. caudatus with confidence that we can have this parasitoid approved for field release at the end of two additional years of study. With the addition of new, complementary species to the parasitoid fauna in Hawaii, we have the potential to incrementally increase fly mortality and to reduce fly infestation, particularly in less preferred hosts. This may help contribute to a systems approach to achieving quarantine security for Hawaii's tropical fruit and vegetable industries, as well as making more and better quality fruit available for local consumption.\",\n",
       " \"Estimates over the last 20 years indicate that plant-parasitic nematodes cause 10-14% average annual yield loss among the world's major crops (Sasser and Freckman, 1987), and losses ranging from minimal in some localities to as high as 15% in other areas in United States major crops (Koenning et al., 1999; McSorley et al., 1987). Indications from initial results of another global survey by the nematology community of nematode associated crop losses are that these estimates remain at similar levels. In economic terms, these estimated annual crop losses translate to at least $8 billion in the United States and $78 billion worldwide (Smiley, 2005). In addition, economic loss associated with increasing material and application costs of nematicides and economic loss associated with trade embargos due to actual or suspected quarantine status nematode infestations exacerbate nematode problems in agriculture. Increasingly, scientific evidence and public awareness have heightened concerns about environment quality, food quality, and human health and safety relative to pest management in agricultural production. The need for alternative, integrated nematode management has been propelled by the actions triggered by the Montreal Protocol and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of the 1990s. Phase-out of methyl bromide is in the latter stages where current use has been reduced by about 80% and is allowed only under negotiated Exceptional Use Permit. Based on FQPA requirements, it is likely that widely-used and efficacious nematicides will be unavailable or greatly restricted in the future. For example, Nemacur, a commonly used nematicide on several crops was canceled in 2007, and the soil fumigant nematicide 1,3-dichloropropene (Telone II) is a B2 carcinogen, reviewed under FQPA and used under more rigorous restriction. Together with another fumigant, metam-sodium, the fumigant nematicides have been identified by California EPA as the largest agricultural source VOC (volatile organic compound) contributors to air pollution by ground level ozone formation. Both locally and nationally, the agricultural production community (our stakeholders) is scrambling to find viable and agro-ecologically sustainable alternatives to chemical-based soil pathogen and nematode control. In addition, world travel and commerce have accelerated the dissemination of pest species, including plant-parasitic nematodes. Development and application of new diagnostic protocols for accurate identification of nematode species is beneficial and necessary for national and international regulatory and quarantine agencies relative to free trade and economics, as exemplified by recent trade restrictions on movement of potatoes due to findings of quarantine-status cyst or root-knot nematodes in US production areas such as Idaho. The nematology community has repeatedly advocated the need for funding support focused on the basic and applied research required to advance agro-ecologically sustainable alternative management approaches and accurate nematode detection and diagnostics.\",\n",
       " 'The Sri Lanka weevil, Myllocerus undecimpustulatus undatus Marshall, is an invasive species not previously known from the new world until its discovery in Broward County, Florida in 2000. In eight years, it has spread to 18 Florida counties on both coasts. Adults cause excessive leaf damage to a growing list of at least 138 plant species, including many important commercial tropical fruits and ornamental plants. The immature stages are spent entirely in the soil where larvae damage roots. The quarantine on this species is affecting domestic and international commerce of these industries. There is a critical need to develop improved management strategies as quickly as possible to reduce the level of damage where it already exists, and to reduce the risk of it spreading to new areas, particularly Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Understanding the biology of this insect is critical to this process. The overall objective of this project is to develop the knowledge required to produce effective and economic short- and long-term solutions for management of this introduced pest. Research on Sri Lanka weevil development, field ecology, damage assessment, control and distribution will be conducted in infested groves and at research centers to produce the information necessary to deliver effective tools for non-disruptive management of this species. Research and Extension entomologists, horticulturalists, and a nematologist will cooperate over the two-year project to conduct research and distribute the findings through bi-lingual extension documents and presentations throughout southern Florida and Puerto Rico.',\n",
       " 'Cell type susceptibility and androgen independence: The pRb tumor suppressor pathway is    frequently altered in human prostate cancer. Our previous studies in multiple cell types have    demonstrated the importance of pRb in suppressing tumor initiation. We have developed a    strategy to dominantly interfere with pRb and potentially compensatory related proteins p107    and p130 by cell specific expression of the SV40 T antigen domain (T121) that binds to and    inactivates all three proteins. We utilized keratin regulation to generate transgenic mice    with androgen-independent epithelial subtype- targeted expression of T121 in prostate    epithelium. In prostate, basal cells express K5 and K14, while luminal cells express K8 and    K18. More recently, intermediate cells have been described with co expression of K5/18 and    other keratins such as K15, 17 and 19. To explore the susceptible cell target(s), we used    compartment-specific keratin gene transcriptional signals to drive expression of a conditional    T121 allele composed of a reporter eGFP gene and stop sequences flanked by loxP sites upstream    of T121 coding sequences. Specifically, K5, K18, and K19 genes were chosen to target basal    cells, luminal cells, and intermediate cells in PE, respectively. To obtain optimal transgene    expression, we have chosen to utilize a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring the    keratin gene to generate transgenic mice. The use of BAC-trangene minimizes position effects    associated with standard transgenes and increases the likelihood that all necessary regulatory    elements will be present. The eGFP stop cassette and T121 gene will be inserted into the BACs    using recombineering technology pioneered by Neal Copeland and colleagues, such that    regulators of the keratin gene will also drive the expression of a conditional T121 allele.    The subsequent introduction of Cre recombinase (via somatic viral delivery or a    tissue-specific transgene) will remove the stop sequences and induce T121 expression.

The animal program and animal laboratory areas are inspected and evaluated at least twice each year by the NIA Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC), in compliance with federal regulations and guidelines.  CMS is working to establish firm and consistent resource management while enhancing a collaborative relationship with investigators.  These efforts are critical to controlling animal numbers while meeting the needs of the investigators.The training offered through NIA CMS ensures that all animal handling is in compliance with NIA, NIH, and federal regulations and guidelines for the continued assurance of full accreditation by the AAALAC, International. The NIA CMS also develops and/or recommends refinements in humane care and handling and provides training to NIA intramural researchers.  Every three years the NIA vivarium undergoes a site visit by the accrediting institution AAALAC.  In 2009, NIA underwent this site visit and the recomendation made by the site visitor at the postvisit review was to continue full accreditation without reservation.  All NIA research staff using animals is required to complete facility-specific training. This training includes requirements for facility entry, proper animal handling procedures, and other related issues. The NIA APD and ACUC Chairperson also provide updates on new/revised Federal, NIH, and/or NIA animal welfare guidelines at monthly NIA meetings.CMS has commissioned and occupied the new vivarium in the BRC.  CMS has developed and is beginning the implementation of a new overall plan for segregation of breeding and experimental animals with the intent of establishing a colony that is free of all known, testable pathogens and to maximize biosecurity within the colony.  Design modifications using modular partitions in the large holding rooms at the BRC have been started.  This will result in in increased control of access to the spaces and increased bio-security.

       " 'PROJECT TITLE: Cyriniform Morphological Novelties: Origin, Performance, and Evolutionary Implications PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Hernandez, L. PatriciaNSF Project #: IOS 1025845Key innovations have long been of interest to evolutionary biologists since such innovations are causally related to adaptive radiations. Cypriniform fishes, which comprise approximately 25% of all freshwater fishes are characterized by a number of evolutionary innovations associated with feeding that may have led to their own adaptive radiation. Although cypriniform fishes comprise an enormous proportion of the freshwater biota relatively little is known about the feeding novelties that characterize this diverse group. This integrative project combines molecular developmental techniques, functional morphological approaches, and comparative methods to investigate the origin and ultimate evolutionary consequences of cypriniform morphological novelties. The different developmental mechanisms involved in the generation of these novelties will be investigated using molecular techniques. A number of experimental approaches (high-speed video, PIV, and XROMM) will be used to investigate functional implications of these feeding novelties. Finally comparative methods will be used to determine the role of correlated evolution in the diversification of certain families within cypriniforms. Results will: clarify the role of different developmental mechanisms in the origin of evolutionary novelty, detail performance implications of novelties that have resulted from different developmental mechanisms, and determine the role of correlated evolution in adaptive radiations. This evo-devo project is unique in examining novelty at several levels starting from a developmental genetic level, through performance, and ultimately to evolutionary consequences.This project also has significant broader impacts including promoting careers in science, interdisciplinary training of all personnel, continued recruiting of underrepresented minorities, and training of K-12 teachers during summer research programs to do simple experiments using zebrafish. Results will be disseminated broadly at varied scientific meetings, university presentations, and an established series of lectures to elementary school students. High-speed videos, as well as developmental techniques, will be available via online sources.',\n",

Research approaches will include both physics-based computational modeling to better understand the physical processes and an experimental work to characterize the resultant morphological, microstructural and electrical properties. The relationship between process parameters and associated physical mechanisms, such as photo-thermal and photo-mechanical reactions will be developed and optimal process conditions for high speed scribing of multilayer thin film materials will be identified.     The successful completion of this work will provide a scientific understanding of the laser-material interaction under the picosecond regime, high power laser, plasma formation, and its interaction with the target material of various thin film layers used for solar cells.   Furthermore, this work will produce fundamental technology advances in the manufacturing of thin film electronics, such as photovoltaic devices, flat panel displays, flexible electronics and advanced semiconductor logic devices and thus will bring a broad impact on manufacturing related issues on these areas.  High frequency, ultrashort lasers have many applications from pulsed laser fabrication of thin films to laser micro/nano fabrication.  Therefore, improving the understanding of high frequency, ultrashort laser-material interaction can significantly improve the potential applications of picosecond lasers.  This project will also bring a positive impact on undergraduate education through the manufacturing classes, undergraduate research fellow programs and undergraduate independent projects.',\n",
       " 'This project studies how changes in the body that occurred during human evolution affect the ability to throw well. Humans are unique among primates in being able to throw objects with both great precision and speed. This ability may have helped our ancestors hunt and defend themselves.  To better understand the evolution and biomechanical bases for human throwing capabilities, this study investigates how changes in the shape of the bones in the arms, shoulders and back affect throwing performance. The researchers are collecting data on how the body moves during a throw using a high speed, 3D camera system. They will then use a custom written computer program to break down and examine the individual motions of each body part during that throw. These data will be collected from a large sample of individuals who vary in the anatomy of their arms, shoulders and back. In addition, restrictive braces will be used to alter the throwing motion in controlled ways. These manipulations will allow us to assess how different components of the trunk and arms contribute to speed and accuracy. This project uses an interdisciplinary approach combining aspects of anthropology, biology, physics and sports medicine to address how different aspects of human anatomy relate to throwing performance. A better understanding of this relationship will improve not only our understanding of human evolution, but will also contribute to our knowledge of how injury occurs in throwing athletes.',\n",
       " 'Every summer in many estuaries and coastal margins, eutrophication elevated phytoplankton production drives rapid bacterial respiration creating hypoxic and anoxic bottom waters. These so-called  dead zones  exclude fish, kill benthic organisms, and eliminate habitat. Despite their popular name, anoxic/hypoxic zones are not really dead, but rather are populated with living and very active microbial communities. In fact, bacterial production in anoxic waters can exceed that in overlying oxic waters due, in part, to reduced grazing and increased cell size and abundance. Once oxygen is depleted, microbial respiration undergoes a succession of redox reactions with decreasing energy yield as terminal electron acceptors are depleted (e.g., O2, NO3-, Mn (IV), Fe (III), and SO42-). This combination of high production and reduced growth efficiency creates a condition in which respiration may be very high, making anoxic zones significant sinks for organic matter and key sites for nutrient cycling.  Previous research documented respiratory succession in Chesapeake Bay bottom waters based on redox chemistry measurements. Heterotrophic bacterial production was very high at some stages of this succession, suggesting elevated respiration. Also, the phylogenetic composition of bacterioplankton communities in anoxic waters was similar to oxic surface waters for nearly half the summer, only changing after the appearance of H2S. This suggests that typical aerobic estuarine bacteria are able to shift to anaerobic metabolisms and continue to dominate.  Most of what is known about microbial respiration and community composition in anoxic water comes from studies of permanently anoxic systems like the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin. By comparison, very little is known about what is a much more common and more dynamic marine environment - seasonally anoxic estuarine waters. This project will conduct a 3-year integrated study to advance the quantitative and mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical cycling in one of the largest seasonal estuarine anoxic zones in the USA.  The PIs hypothesize that: 1) Dominant sub-pycnocline respiratory processes undergo a succession from aerobic respiration to nitrate respiration and metal reduction to sulfate reduction; 2) Bacterial growth efficiency decreases with this respiratory succession, but bacterial production remains high, resulting in very high carbon respiration rates; 3) Bacterial community composition changes little during respiratory succession until sulfate respiration dominates (i.e., the sulfide threshold), but gene expression closely tracks changes in redox conditions in order to support the most energetic respiratory processes.  The PIs will address these hypotheses by quantifying carbon respiration rates using several techniques including carbon respiration rate; quantifying bacterial production, biomass and growth efficiency; and characterizing succession in the composition and respiratory gene expression patterns of microbial communities in water column and sediments during each stage of respiratory succession. This project will integrate biogeochemical, biological, and genomic data to explain how biogeochemistry influences, and is influenced by, microbial respiration, production, diversity, and gene expression.Broader Impacts. The project will provide (1) reliable measurements of production and respiration in anoxic/hypoxic waters, (2) techniques applicable to other ecosystems, and (3) ecological insight for predicting future changes with ongoing restoration efforts in anoxia-impacted estuaries. These measurements will be useful for calibrating biogeochemical models and for estimating carbon budgets. Two graduate students and one postdoctoral scientist will be trained in several state-of-the-art geochemical and molecular biology techniques. Two teachers will be engaged to work on this project and to participate in the seven-week Environmental Science Education Partnership (ESEP) Teacher Research Fellowship Program (www.esep.umces.edu) at UMCES Horn Point Laboratory. New discoveries will be incorporated into graduate-level courses entitled Aquatic Microbial Ecology, Biological Oceanography, and Environmental Geochemistry.

       " 'Anthony G. GarzaIOS-0950976Coordinating Developmental Gene Expression in Myxococcus xanthus Most bacteria live in organized multicellular communities called biofilms.  Biofilms have been linked to a variety of problems important to humans: biofilms contaminate water supplies, medical equipment, and industrial machinery, and biofilms cause many persistent infections.  A fundamental goal in microbiology is to understand how these interesting and important bacterial communities develop.  Recently, it has become apparent that bacteria use a number of conserved design principles to build a biofilm.  Namely, cells produce extracellular signals to communicate information about cell density and cell position and this information is used to regulate the temporal and spatial expression of developmental genes.  This project focuses on the regulation of developmental genes in Myxococcus xanthus.  When starving, M. xanthus forms a biofilm containing a thin mat of cells and multicellular fruiting body structures.  A cascade of enhancer binding proteins (EBPs), which is designed to respond to a variety of extracellular signals, is used to regulate many developmental genes.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand how this regulatory network coordinates developmental gene expression and, ultimately, how it promotes the assembly of a biofim.  The EBP Nla4 functions at the front end of the cascade, regulating the entry into development.  The aim of this project is to understand how Nla4 helps cells navigate through this critical juncture in development.  Specifically, this project aims to find Nla4 target genes, to understand how Nla4 recognizes target promoters and to determine whether these target genes are important for development.  It seems likely that regulatory networks analogous to the EBP cascade will be a common theme in bacteria that make biofilms, since they must also process a variety of signal information to properly regulate their developmental genes.  Therefore, we believe that this project will lead to a model for gene regulation that is pertinent to many bacterial systems.',\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purchase of a bioluminescent imaging (BLI) system is requested for the core imaging facility at the University of California San Diego Medical Center (UCSDMC), Hillcrest. While various microscopes, and non-invasive imagers (i.e. magnetic resonance imaging) are available at the Medical Center for select user groups, we do not have a BLI system at this site. Based upon the high demand placed on the fee-for- service access (i.e. it is located in La Jolla) to the only other BLI imager at UCSD, difficulty in transporting many samples (i.e. intravital imaging, live cells, fresh tissue specimens), the addition of a core BLI system at the UCSDMC would greatly enhance a diverse array of ongoing NIH-funded research programs. For example, imaging of intravital chambers implanted in animal models is not feasible off-campus due to the difficulties of quarantine and surgical needs. As detailed in this proposal, we have formed a committee (Brian Eliceiri, Tony Yaksh, Andrew Baird, and Allen Ryan) to identify a core group of Primary Users, determined the specific needs of the UCSDMC, and chosen appropriate instrumentation to accomplish the goals of our research group. The operation of this BLI system will be integrated into a centrally located, open access core imaging facility that has been established for in vivo imaging as well as time course studies and general imaging. Following extensive consultation and analysis of various competing BLI systems, we have identified the Caliper Life Sciences IVIS Spectrum as the ideal system for a core environment, maximizing ease of use with capable specifications for current and future requirements. All Primary and Secondary Users have active NIH-funded research programs through the NIH, with one of the investigators the PI of a P20 Exploratory Center. The cost of the requested BLI system is $364,672 and will be matched by an institutional commitment for 50% salary support for a technician to manage the system and secured, centrally-accessible space. The balance of the salary will come from a cost-recapture from individual grants, based on usage. In combination with our existing imaging infrastructure, the proposed BLI system will be an important addition to maximize the impact of our existing research programs.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Behavioral Testing Core (BTC) Facility is a valuable resource for the UCLA scientific community. The UCLA Brain Research Institute membership consists of over 300 faculty members from 26 academic departments. The BTC provides the space, equipment, and instruction necessary for the behavioral testing needs of UCLA researchers. The type of assistance provided by the BTC enables behavioral testing for the researchers that cannot form collaborations with one of the few labs on campus that specialize in behavioral research. The BTC is requesting one-time equipment funding to greatly improve the fear conditioning setup which is widely used to study learning and memory mechanisms, drug and gene effects on fear and anxiety. The current BTC fear conditioning equipment requires replacement. The Med Associates equipment currently in use is outdated and unreliable. The automated scoring programs are first-generation  home-made  systems that do not have the power, flexibility and accuracy of state-of- the-art systems. In order to ensure that researchers get usable results, the BTC would like to provide better equipment for this task. The requested funds would be used to replace the ineffective equipment with state of-the -art instrument from Med Associates, the most-cited manufacturer of fear equipment. Their new Video Freeze software is highly reliable for automated freezing studies. It is the only system that was developed with validation of an expert in fear conditioning (Dr.Stephan Anagnostaras, UCSD). The requested funds cover 12 fear conditioning setups (boxes), controlling software, and computer. Crucial for research in fear extinction is the use of more than 2 contexts to understand how fear can be renewed, re-instated and spontaneously recovered following extinction. These boxes have interchangeable parts that allow the formation of multiple contexts and testing for both rats and mice. In addition, we plan to use 6 of these boxes within the mouse housing room suite to cut the quarantine time (normally 6- 8 weeks) of animals bred off-site (e.g., knock-out mice from a collaborator). This would enable PIs to conduct experiments that are time sensitive (e.g., age and time-dependent gene expression studies). This approach will also allow PI's to cut costs on animal per diems from a prolonged quarantine period. This plan has been developed in conjunction with campus veterinarian Dr.Marcelo Couto and the UCLA Division of Laboratory animals and Medicine.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fear conditioning is a robust model of fear and anxiety in rats and mice. The use of such a model will allow for a more defined understanding of the neural, genetic, behavioral components underlying human anxiety disorders. Such knowledge would allow for the developments of better treatments.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular evolution of primate DNA double-strand break repair genes will be studied. These genes are important for genome stability, and many cancer syndromes have been linked to mutations in these genes. Interestingly, many members of this gene family bear signatures of recurrent positive selection. The hypothesis being tested is that these signatures result from the long-term co-evolution between these DNA repair genes and the pervasive, parasitic retroviruses and retrotransposons with which primates have evolved. This may have influenced primate DNA repair genes with respect to both polymorphic and fixed genetic variation. In this proposed research, large primate sequence datasets will be generated for genes involved in human double-strand break repair, and these will be tested for signatures of recurrent positive selection. Retroviral infection assays will then be used to test whether adaptive sequence change in these DNA repair genes has resulted in altered susceptibility to infection. The consequences of this sequence change to cellular DNA repair will also be explored. Preliminary data in a cell culture model system shows that one of the most well-known cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, may be evolving under the dual selective pressures of DNA repair fidelity and retroviral resistance. Based on this, DNA repair gene evolution can have a profound effect on cancer, and for this reason, it is of great importance that the evolutionary forces that define the evolution of these genes be elucidated. This proposed research is central to the overarching goal of understanding how genetic parasites, through the selective pressures that they exert, shape the sequence of human genes with which they interact.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human cells contain a complex network of DNA repair pathways, which have evolved to protect the integrity of chromosomes. However, the evolution and function of DNA repair proteins may be influenced by retroviral pathogens, like HIV, which use these proteins for their own benefit. Understanding the evolution of DNA repair genes is important to understanding both the formation of cancers and susceptibility to retroviral infection.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) requests funds to modernize and transform our 1975 built Central Research Animal Facility (CRAF) so we can continue to effectively and efficiently conduct primarily NIH funded research. Since 1998 the number of NIH funded experiments using animals has nearly quadrupled in the CRAF and no significant improvements to the existing CRAF infrastructure have been made since the facility's inception. The only realistic way to accommodate projected continued growth in animal numbers, experiments and scientific techniques is to redesign and rebuild our CRAF. Without significant improvements currently funded NIH research at our institution may undergo significant delays as Principal Investigator's animals are subject to increasingly lengthy repairs of their macro-environments. We request funds for replacement of our current heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) unit and modernization of a portion of its associated infrastructure; creation of a central corridor with adjoining animal procedure rooms transforming the majority of the CRAF main housing area into a clean/dirty barrier housing area for mice; expansion and relocation our cage wash facility to a more efficient location; replacement of limited concrete floor and complete resurfacing of floors and walls; replacement of old worn ceilings with easily sanitized fiberglass planked ceilings with access panels to best service HVAC, plumbing and electrical infrastructure; replacement of facility doors and bumper guards; replacement of present animal room lights with tri-level lighting; replacement of existing aged water lines with Edstrom stainless steel water lines; installation of a modern monitoring system such as the Edstrom Watchdog system; remodeling of our present biological containment corridor; relocation of administrative offices outside of the animal facility; redesign of our surgical suite; creation of a bio-imaging suite; remodeling of rooms to include anterooms for quarantine, necropsy and primate housing; relocation of large animal housing space and necropsy room; replacement of our poorly functioning walk-in washer with a more efficient, modern unit; and purchase of a downdraft necropsy table for our necropsy area and a medium sized sterilizer for our bio-containment area. We plan to accomplish our goal of complete redesign and renovation of our CRAF in eighteen months. We will first upgrade our mechanical systems followed by concurrent renovation of our administrative area and portion of the facility closest to our loading dock containing the MRI suite, quarantine, necropsy and bio-containment sections in nine months. We will renovate the remainder of the CRAF including our cage wash area over the next nine months. Redesigning and rebuilding our CRAF will enable us to optimize animal and human movement, sterile work practices, animal care, experimentation, disease prevention and containment as well as to maximize facility housing and experimental flexibility using the most modern proven green construction practices possible.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Louisville proposes to expand the existing Center for Predictive Medicine (CPM) Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) to support work with select agents utilizing rodents, rabbits and ferrets as animal models in long term efficacy/product evaluation studies. The expansion will facilitate translational studies with the addition of hematology, clinical and whole-animal imaging services and related services for efficacy/product evaluation. Further, the expansion will provide receiving, quarantine and vaccination space in ABSL2 prior to animal studies transfer to ABSL3. ABSL2/3 animal holding areas and BSL3 support labs will be developed as suites with shared procedure and exam spaces. These suites will take advantage of existing trimodal live animal imaging capacities within the CPM and other existing support services. Importantly, the expansion will provide infrastructure for GLP studies with the Provantis(tm) system or other similar types of validated monitoring systems. The existing RBL was designed and built with infrastructure that will easily accommodate this future growth. Existing utilities (electrical, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water service, fire service, emergency power) are sized and installed to accommodate expansion. Existing animal cage and rack wash and sterilization equipment within the existing CPM can accommodate this additional capacity. Security infrastructure (internal to facility and site fencing, setbacks and intrusion barriers) loading dock and service areas will be installed. All are adequate for expanded capacity. Site capacity for expansion is also accommodated and the existing facility is designed to attain LEED certification. This will permit the expansion to also achieve LEED certification and be in step with other sustainability initiatives set forth by the University of Louisville.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to merge genomics, microfluidics, DNA and RNA amplification, microarrays, analytical instrumentation development and polymer microfabrication expertises to develop a revolutionary medical diagnostic device for the rapid multiparametric detection of the most relevant viruses found in respiratory tract clinical samples. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) is the most common illness today (Fendrick et al., 2003), and costs over $50 billion yearly in the US alone. It is estimated that more than a dozen different viruses infect human upper airways, yet current diagnostic methods based on viral antigens often lack the required sensitivity, while culture-based methods are extremely slow. Universit¿ Laval with its collaborators intends to integrate their already existing diagnostic technologies into a single Microfluidic Centripetal Device (MCD), or Lab-on-a-Chip, for the detection of VRTIs (VRTI-MCD). The VRTI-MCD will automatically (i) process nasopharyngeal swab samples, (ii) extract viral RNA/DNA in a sufficiently pure form, (iii) amplify and label nucleic acids, (iv) process labelled-amplicons, (v) hybridize amplicons on low density microarrays, (vi) read and interpret the data to provide a clinically useful result within one hour, and (vii) communicate results in real-time to health information systems. The VRTI-MCD will be a disposable polymer-based device that will encase all necessary reagents. The disposable will be processed by a portable and easy-to-use opto-mechanical instrument enabling automated VRTI diagnostics. Seventeen viruses, including influenza A (such as avian flu and swine flu), influenza B, SARS coronavirus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus responsible for the majority of VRTI along with key antiviral resistance markers will be detectable using a single VRTI-MCD. This novel diagnostic platform will be developed and optimized using nasopharyngeal swab specimens available in the extensive clinical samples collection at the Centre de Recherch¿ en Infectiologie (CRI). By the end of year-five support by NIH, we will have validated the integrated VRTI-MCD using human clinical samples and the portable instrument will be ready for worldwide clinical testing for diagnostics at the point-of-care. Thereafter, within two years, product development and approval by health authorities (FDA, Health Canada, etc.) will be undertaken by a commercial partner. This new technological platform will result in an unprecedented expansion of point-of-care diagnostic tests (POCTs) for viral respiratory tract infections, while providing rapid yet economical molecular diagnostics results in less than one hour instead of the current 2-3 days. This will improve medical response, allowing for the timely use of proper antiviral drugs and to ensure that rapid quarantine measures only be used when appropriate. These POCTs will help public health authorities to define new operational strategies for both lab-based and field-based applications.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of this proposal is to elucidate some of the molecular connections between the complex, interrelated processes of antibiotic production and morphological development in the model bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. The streptomycetes are an incredibly valuable source of bioactive molecules, including the majority of antibiotics clinically used. These mycelial bacteria typically synthesize antibiotics and other secondary metabolites concurrently with broader developmental events that result in the generation of an aerial mycelium on the colony surface whose filamentous cells ultimately sporulate. The aims of this study concern two particular types of proteins that influence both antibiotic production and development in S. coelicolor. First, the phosphopantetheinyl transferase are enzymes that catalyze a posttranslational modification required for the activity of many antibiotic biosynthetic enzymes. Mutation of the SCO6673 PPTase gene in S. coelicolor results in loss of the ability to produce calcium dependent-antibiotic but also conversely hyperproduction of the potential anti-cancer molecule undecylprodigiosin. Sporulation is also delayed in this mutant. In order to understand the basis for these diverse phenotypic effects, real-time PCR will be used to assess any differences in expression of known antibiotic regulatory and developmental genes in the PPTase mutant as compared to the wild type. This data will inform a subsequent targeted mutational strategy to engineer S. coelicolor for maximum undecylprodigiosin production. The second aim focuses on understanding how activity of a likely stress response ECF sigma factor, ?U, can block both polyketide antibiotic production and aerial mycelium formation in S. coelicolor. A combination of microarray analysis and proteomic studies comparing wild type S. coelicolor to a rsuA mutant with high, unregulated ?U activity will establish the complete regulon of ?U-dependent genes as well as those indirectly affected by ?U activity. The relevance of the observed elevation of both extracellular protease and pentose phosphate pathway enzyme activity in the rsuA mutant to its antibiotic production and developmental defects will be tested by mutation or overexpression of the relevant genes and analysis of the resulting strains. Mutational analysis will also be used to test the involvement of the likely membrane protein SCO4110 in the regulation of ?U activity. A better understanding of how secondary metabolism and development are mutually influenced may ultimately suggest generalizable strategies for effective pharmaceutical production in the streptomycetes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand how Streptomyces bacteria make useful compounds, such as antibiotics, as part of their overall life cycle. The better we understand how these beneficial bacteria grow, the more likely it is that we can engineer that growth to produce life-saving drugs for fighting infections and cancers.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While antibiotic use has been identified as the most likely selective pressure driving the increasing frequency of resistance genes, very few studies have experimentally measured the selective pressures they impose, the effects of varying the duration of antimicrobial exposure, and the effects of simultaneous exposure of multiple antibiotics on bacterial populations. Understanding basic evolutionary dynamics of bacteria as they respond to a variety of antibiotic resistance selection pressures will provide an experimental basis for developing antibiotic prescription guidelines that may contribute to maintaining the usefulness of currently available antibiotics. The overall goal of this project is to experimentally determine the fitness effects of expressing antibiotic resistance determinants. The specific aims of this study are: 1. Determine fitness effects associated with carriage of the more commonly encountered resistance genes in the presence of the corresponding antibiotics. 2. Experimentally determine how temporal variation in antibiotic dosing affects the frequencies of resistance genes. 3. Experimentally determine how simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics affects the frequencies of resistance genes. These studies will focus specifically on TEM, SHV, and CTX-M 2-lactamases, which hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and other 2-lactam antibiotics. I anticipate that data produced in these experimental evolution studies will help to inform future pathogen remediation efforts.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibiotic resistance imposes an enormous health burden throughout the world. The experiments described in this proposal are anticipated to contribute to the development of practices that will reduce the occurrence of resistance.',\n",

These animals have completed the mandatory three-month quarantine period at the Yerkes Primate Research Center. In preparation for renal transplantation, we have determined the ABO blood types on the animals, performed specific MHC allele typing, performed pre-transplant mixed lymphocyte reactions to verify donor-specific alloreactivity, and determined donor and recipient pairs. Initial donor nephrectomies are scheduled in early January and initial renal transplants will begin in early February. The effects of alefacept with or without abatacept or belatacept have been evaluated in vitro. We found that primate effector memory T cells are characterized by high CD2 and low CD28 expression that increases with each cell division following allo-stimulation. We have performed intracellular cytokine staining and shown that CD8+CD2hiCD28- cells exhibit the highest proportion of both triple cytokine producers (IFN¿, TNF¿, IL-2) and dual expressers of cytotoxic effector molecules (CD107a and granzyme B). In one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions, proliferating cells are phenotypically CD8+CD2hiCD28-. Addition of belatacept or abatacept in vitro inhibited proliferation (1.9- to 5-fold), and addition of alefacept inhibited aba- and belatacept-resistant proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that the most alloreactive T cells, as measured by both proliferation and effector molecule expression, are overwhelmingly CD28-and represent a population of armed effectors that are able to evade costimulation blockade. The coincident high CD2 expression of this costimulation blockade-resistant population heightens its susceptibility to alefacept.',\n",

Our first aim is to provide a keynote and several state-of-the-art 45 minute presentations that will invigorate and excite the scientists about this chosen field of study. Although not finalized, we have assembled an impressive list of potential speakers to invite (see page 6). In addition, we have asked the conveners for each section to identify scientists they deem strategic, mostly from within our nidoviral community. The identified scientists will present their work in a 30 minute time period as convener selected presentions.

       " 'Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD), a non-chemical alternative to soil fumigation with methyl bromide (MeBr), was developed in Japan and the Netherlands where it is used to control soilborne pathogens and nematodes in strawberries and vegetables. The ASD system can be utilized in urbanized areas where buffer restrictions would limit the applicability of alternative fumigants and, unlike many other biologically-based alternatives, has a broad-spectrum of activity, impacting most pests that are currently controlled by MeBr:chloropicrin combinations. This work will allow transfer of this promising technology to multiple cropping systems in many geographic locations and across differing soil types and environmental conditions in the United States. In a previously funded project, we confirmed the potential of ASD in Florida vegetable and coastal California strawberry production. To further that work, the goals of this project are threefold: (1) to build on previous efforts and further extend ASD for broad-spectrum control of soilborne pathogens, plant parasitic-nematodes, and weeds; (2) to gather additional data in tightly-controlled experiments to allow ASD to be effectively modeled and implemented across diverse local environmental conditions, production systems, and available inputs; and (3) to demonstrate the effectiveness of ASD in commercial-scale demonstration trials with production of a variety of economically important crops in Tennessee, Florida, and California to facilitate adoption of ASD by US growers who currently utilize MeBr under critical use and quarantine and preshipment allowances.

       " 'Citrus Greening or  Huangongling  caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus was recently identified in Puerto Rico. Citrus production acreage in Puerto Rico reached 7,500 acres planted in 2008-2009, and net production was valued at $ 8.6 million. Citrus is widely planted in Puerto Rico, with backyard trees for households, and on over 2,800 farms in the mountainous region of the island, thus indicating the importance of the crop not only for agricultural production but for the supply of the household. The disease that slowly weakens and eventually kills the citrus host can spread quickly through its vector the citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri. The priority in Puerto Rico is to determine the disease spread, to implement quarantine regulations, and to find the most effective and efficient strategies to control the vector to prevent disease spread. An on-going survey indicates that the disease is present in the northwestern municipality of Isabela and in the southcentral municipality of Juana Diaz; therefore, control strategies and management practices need to be studied and validated in Puerto Rico. The presence of the vector the psyllid Diaphorina citri was documented in 2001 in the areas of Adjuntas and Isabela in Citrus and Murraya. The current status of the control of citrus greening relies on spraying from the ground, scouting and removing trees. The application of systemic pesticides including TemikTM and Admire plus additional foliar applications of other insecticides considerably increases costs. In the actual difficult economic situation of half of the citrus growers in Puerto Rico these practices will be used only by farmers with considerable acreage. A large number of orchards and nurseries will not be sprayed or scouted. Therefore, the use of non-pesticide methods will be important to understand the dynamics of natural enemies in order to use these enemies to prevent pest immigration to citrus plants. The implementation of a certification process of plants from nurseries is needed and this project will offer a combined research and outreach program aiming to: (i) provide diagnostic services for the disease identification, and the certification process for nurseries in Puerto Rico; (ii) to ameliorate the impact of the disease with different alternatives including barrier crops and natural enemy protection for decreasing vector populations; and (iii) to evaluate the use of alternative chemical control agents. Currently, the symptoms observed in citrus orchards indicate that this is probably the first outbreak of the disease,0. and since fruit production has not yet been significantly affected the impact of the project is warranted.',\n",

Improved management of nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems is important for sustainable food production. Availability of nitrogen from organic sources is the result of microbial enzymatic processes especially nitrogen mineralization, immobilization and nitrification. To link these microbial functions to the responsible microbial community in soils requires additional molecular sequence based tools and database information. In this project, novel methods for the examination of microorganisms responsible for nitrogen turnover will be developed and will enable description of the microbial community responsive to contrasting nitrogen sources and quantities. Our goal is to describe functional diversity in the root-zone microbial communities responsible for selected nitrogen transformations in agroecosystems under contrasting management. Knowledge of diversity in the genes encoding enzymes responsible for N cycling will strengthen our understanding of microbial controls on nitrogen availability to plants.

Forty-five farmers, on average, will participate live in each of 12 annual Farminar online seminars, a three-year total of 1,620 farmer learners; archives of the Farminars will be viewed online 9,000 times; 2. 600 beginning farmers will attend workshops, field days, and retreats offered by Practical Farmers of Iowa and its partners that will help them improve their new farms; 3. 50 beginning farmers will receive hands-on mentoring on profitable and stewardship-based farms, through Practical Farmers of Iowa's mentoring program; 4. 60 beginning farmers will have graduated from Grow Your Small Market Farm and will participate in the program's ongoing networking opportunities; 5. 240 women landowners and beginning farmers will attend meetings to learn about land stewardship and land rental/ownership opportunities; 6. 1,500 beginning farmers will use Practical Farmers of Iowa's website to find land, farming resources, internships, and to network with each other; 7. More than 750,000 Iowans will receive information about this programming through the outreach efforts of Practical Farmers of Iowa. Potential Long-Range Impacts: This project will work toward a vibrant American agriculture by stopping the decline of farmers who rely upon their farming operations for their major source of income. With more careful planning, networking with experienced farmers, and training, beginning farmers can start farming in a way that ensures success. With its efforts to serve small farms, the project also will work to preserve rural infrastructure and rural communities. Another major benefit of this project is to facilitate the land linkages that generations ago were made largely between families and neighbors.

       " 'The nursery and greenhouse industries are important sectors of U.S. Agriculture providing about 2 million jobs. Diseases like powdery mildew and wood boring insects affect many ornamental plants, reduce aesthetic value and stunts plant growth causing significant economic losses. Insect pests damage the vascular system of nursery trees, which may kill trees or ruin the quality of the tree for sale. Due to high aesthetic standards for ornamental crops, pesticide applications have become a routine practice, often before symptoms appear and continued season-long. The high frequency of pesticide applications creates a potential for frequent and repeated pesticide exposure and the potential for accidental pesticide poisoning of nursery workers and handlers. In addition, nursery quarantine pests such as Japanese beetle and imported fire ants have regulatory tolerance of zero and plant shipments receive pesticide treatments even when pests are absent from the commodity. Many of the pesticides widely used in nursery production systems have high acute toxicity or other toxicological issues including carcinogens that may cause chronic health problems. The proposed project will focus on technology transfer of research results to nursery production systems; provide reduced-risk alternatives to conventional pesticides in pest and disease management, and educational information that can allow growers to make informed choices. The following are specific objectives of this project: (1) Conduct demonstrations on effective and reduced-risk products, reduce conventional pesticide usage and pesticide exposure in nursery production systems, (2) Conduct demonstrations on effective and reduced-risk methodologies for pesticide applications to lower pesticide exposures to plant handlers, (3) Advance on-going studies to evaluate additional biopesticides for management of disease and insect pests, (4) Release and disseminate new disease resistant cultivars of flowering dogwood and (5) Provide experiential student training on the role of research and extension to address agricultural production problems.',\n",

To develop and implement biological control programs that reduce the economic importance of subtropical pests of horticultural crops. To increase our knowledge of salient aspects of the biology and behavior of invasive horticultural pests in association with their host plants and natural enemies. Identify combinations of pest control tactics for pests of floricultural and nursery/landscape plants that interact synergistically to improve pest control, are practical to implement, and will minimize environmental disruption.Approach:IPM strategies based on biological control will be developed. Natural control ofsubtropical insect pests by native and imported biological control agents will beassessed, and methods of conservation and augmentation to boost natural control by these agents will be investigated. Exotic biological control agents for invasive insect pests will be identified through literature reviews, collaborations with foreign scientists, or foreign exploration; adhering to federal and state regulations, these agents will be imported into the US, evaluated under federal or state quarantine facilities, released and monitored for establishment and impact. IPM strategies based on plant resistance will be developed. Insect bioassays and field trials will be conducted to identify plant varieties that are pest resistant. Citrus, vegetable and ornamental germplasm as well as non-host plant species will be screened; genes associated with insect resistance will be cloned, characterized and considered for cultivar improvement through traditional and transgenic procedures. When plant resistance is found, plant products responsible for resistance will be identified and explored for use in IPM. Transgenic plants produced at USHRL or elsewhere will be evaluated for effects on insect biology, resistance to pests, and disease transmission by insect vectors. The genetic bases of insect biology and of interactions among insect vectors, plant pathogens and host plants will be investigated using molecular techniques and genomics analyses, and IPM opportunities based on these investigations will be pursued. Molecular techniques will be used to examine the biology, gene expression and biochemical pathways of exotic insect pests. Vector-pathogen relations will be characterized biochemically and biologically, and the results will be applied to insect pest problems. Research on insect biology and behavior will be conducted to advance IPM. Biorationals such as entomopathogenic fungi, viruses and bacteria, microbials, sugar esters, oils, and azadiractin that have potential as environmentally benign IPM components will be identified and assessed. Methods of monitoring and estimating infestation densities of insect pests and their natural enemies will be developed including traps baitedwith attractants and sampling protocols.

       " 'This project is one of discovery, understanding, and characterization of invasive plant pathogens, including description of new species, as well as new races, and pathotypes of established pathogens. The importance to the mission of the MAES is in the science-based effort of protecting the natural resources (forests), crops (nursery and potato), and plant industry (landscape and arboriculture) of Michigan and the United States from destructive pathogens. This effort of protection includes clarifying systematic and biological information to improve the decision making of government agencies on regulatory and quarantine issues of disease control. Additionally, the nature of this project is to approach better understanding of fundamental genetic mechanisms of variation in virulence, and sudden shifts in race, fungicide resistance, and host preference of pathogens. The project emphasizes invasive pathogens of forest trees, particular pathogens that are model systems of invasive forest pathogens, recent hybridizations leading to shifts in tree host preference, pathogens expected to expand their geographical range with climate change, newly recognized pathogens that need description, and unexplored genetic systems that lead to sudden shifts in race and fungicide sensitivity. The project also includes biogeographical biodiversity surveys of forest pathogens of the Rocky Mountain and Alaska community bar-coding effort led by the PI, several state surveys, collaborative state and regional surveys, to supplement knowledge of native pathogens, as part of forest disease risk assessment, forest health evaluation, and monitoring for invasive pathogens. The project includes determining the native or introduced status of emergent pathogens, quantifying damage levels by pathogens that are poorly understood, improving technology for the diagnosis of tree diseases, investigating tree diseases of unknown etiology such as physiological leaf scorch (Swartz et al 2009), white pine branch mortality,and designing and recommending relevant integrated pest management programs and disease control methods.',\n",
       " 'More than 1,000 immigrant insect species currently live in Florida. Moreover, exotic insects continue to arrive into the state at the rate of approximately 1 per month. Some of these species are pests of agricultural crops, turf and landscape flora, and native plants. Because they arrive in an area where their co-evolved natural enemies do not exist and the native fauna is often ineffective in controlling them, their populations frequently explode to enormous levels such that they cause economic loss or damage, or endanger native flora in natural ecosystems that are already at the edge of existence. The overall goal of this project is to find, study, multiply, release, and evaluate parasites, predators, and pathogens (called natural enemies) for control of invasive pest insects that attack crops and endanger native flora in Florida. Specific activities of this project aim to: 1) carry out surveys and assessments of natural enemies already attacking selected invasive pest insects in Florida; 2) conduct and coordinate overseas exploration for exotic natural enemies with potential as biological control agents of non-native herbivorous insect pests in Florida; 3) study the natural history, climatic tolerance, behavior, and host specificity of the potential biological control agents in a quarantine facility; 4) develop technologies for production of high-quality imported parasites and predators in quantities sufficient for release in the field; 5) release parasites and predators with a reasonable probability of establishing viable populations in the field, and monitor their post-release establishment and dispersal; and 6) evaluate the ecological impacts of the released biological control agents on pest populations and elucidate interactions with other natural enemies. Target pests include, but are not limited to, beetles, moths, flies, scale insects, mealybugs, aphids, and plant lice. Target pests which will receive particular attention are the cycad aulacaspis scale, the Mexican bromeliad weevil, the yellow-margined leaf beetle, and the Asian citrus psyllid.',\n",
       " \"Invasive non-indigenous species in the United States cause environmental damage and economic losses estimated at $120 billion/year, of which invasive plants account for nearly $35 billion. Alien invasive plants are defined as those which have escaped cultivation, colonized natural or semi-natural areas, and resulted in substantial changes to native systems in terms of species composition, structure or ecosystem processes. In fiscal year 1999/2000, Florida state agencies spent an estimated $90.8 million to control exotic plants. Densities of plants in their native ranges are typically limited by a complex of herbivores and diseases. However, when a plant is moved, accidentally or intentionally, from one area of the world to another, its natural enemies are often left behind, allowing the plant to reach higher densities than are found in the native home. This is often referred to as the `Enemy Release Hypothesis'. Classical biological control is an approach that is used to manage alien invasive plants. Host specific arthropods and plant diseases which attack invasive plants in their native ranges are identified and introduced to the area of invasion for long-term density suppression. The invasive plants which will initially be targeted in this project include 1) Brazilian peppertree, the most widely distributed invasive plant in Florida, 2) Hydrilla, a submersed aquatic freshwater plant which grows from shallow waters to water depths of over 20 feet, 3) tropical soda apple, a prickly perennial weed from South America and 4) Jamaican nightshade, a prickly perennial shrub native to the neotropics. General methods The steps involved in classical biological control of weeds are similar in all programs; 1) the native range of the plant/plant genotype is identified through taxonomic studies, 2) natural enemies of the plants in the native range are identified and their ecology investigated, 3) those that appear to be host specific are introduced for quarantine studies, 4) extensive host range experiments are conducted to determine whether the candidate agents will attack any non-target plants, 5) petitions for release are prepared and submitted for review to federal and state regulatory agencies, 6) permitted agents are released, and 7) agent establishment is assessed and their effect on target plants is evaluated . Expected outcomes Natural enemies will be introduced into quarantine laboratories in Florida and host range testing will be conducted. Applications for release of those deemed safe will be prepared and submitted to federal and state authorities. Approved biological control agents will be released, and their impact evaluated. It is anticipated introduced biological control agents will substantially reduce population densities of invasive plants in Florida.\",\n",
       " 'Efforts to improve crop plants through traditional breeding have been highly effective to date, however, many desirable traits, such as insect resistance, cannot be attained by this method. In addition, methods to control pathogens and pests through application of toxic chemicals are ineffective as resistance to these compounds develops and the cost of developing new compounds increases. Many of these chemicals also have health and environmental drawbacks. Traditional cultural controls, by themselves, are usually insufficient to control plant diseases and insect pests. Given these facts, biotechnological approaches to crop improvement and controlling pathogens and pests are showing ever greater utility. For example, sanitation and quarantine efforts have been greatly assisted by molecular detection methods which are far more sensitive than traditional biological methods for screening seed lots and plant materials. Transgenic approaches to crop improvement have yielded substantial improvements in yield and profitability for growers, although transgenic approaches are still far from reaching their full potential. Although the genomes of many crop species and pathogens have been sequenced, we still lack fundamental knowledge concerning the function of many genes. When transgenic techniques are combined with genomics, there is great potential for the discovery of genes contributing to pathogen and pest resistance as well as improved crop traits. The goals of this project include improvement in control of pathogens and pests through the application of molecular tools. Project goals also include the discovery of genes important to the host pathogen interaction and the use of transgenic approaches to understanding their function as well incorporation into important crop varieties.',\n",

       " 'Overfishing and human-derived nutrient pollution affect the supply of growth-limiting nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for algae and seagrasses, the base of most marine ecosystems. Human inputs increase the supply of nutrients, which are largely sewage-derived, while overfishing has been shown to reduce nutrient supply because fish provide substantial inputs of nutrients via excretion. These contrasting inputs present the paradox that human-derived nutrients may supplant fish-derived nutrients. However, human-derived nutrients are higher in phosphorus relative to fish-derived nutrients, shifting the baseline at which nutrients are supplied and potentially altering the diversity and growth rates of algae and seagrass species.Synopsis:Overfishing and nutrient pollution affect the supply of growth-limiting nutrients for algae and seagrasses, the base of most marine ecosystems. Human inputs increase the supply of nutrients, while overfishing can reduce nutrient supply because fish provide inputs of nutrients via excretion. We test the hypothesis that human-derived nutrients can supplant fish-derived nutrients by simulating both of these scenarios independently and simultaneously using artificial patch reef habitats.',\n",

       " 'Invasive pest species are detrimental to agriculture and forest systems because they disrupt natural ecosystems and exhibit rapid population growth that can result in greater crop damage and harm to human health and welfare. Invasive species are costly to manage and often move readily via human commerce, which makes regulating and containing their spread difficult. Multiple invasive pests now impact the nursery industry in the United States either by increasing production costs to manage new pests, restricting or eliminating trade markets, or by implementing costly quarantine programs. The Japanese beetle (JB) and imported fire ant (IFA) are two invasive species that have caused multiple millions in damage to U.S. agriculture and public interests. Both JB and IFA are regulated by nursery quarantines to prevent their spread to new regions of the U.S. because they are readily transported in nursery soils. Disruption of nursery trade by quarantines results in economic impacts that can threaten the sustainability of the $150 billion U.S. Green Industry. Based on market destination, JB and IFA quarantine treatments affect an estimated 5% and 80% of nursery plant sales from the eastern and southern U.S., respectively. Therefore, IFA has a much greater nursery impact than JB. Current JB and IFA quarantine treatments for field-grown nursery plants are expensive, impractical, and limited to a few insecticide ingredients (i.e., bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam). All field-grown nursery treatments for IFA currently use chlorpyrifos, which threatens industry viability if chlorpyrifos becomes unavailable. The purpose of this project is to find new alternative insecticides and biopesticides to eliminate JB and IFA from field-grown nursery stock and provide growers with more options, to evaluate a new tree irrigation technique for applying treatments, and to release and establish new IFA biological control agents in Tennessee. The project will focus on developing new pre-harvest treatments for JB and IFA, which can be efficiently applied with mechanized equipment, reducing time and cost for growers. Reduced-risk biopesticides will be tested as conventional pesticide alternatives for nursery root ball dips or drenches, to lower the risk of post-harvest JB and IFA treatment methods to nursery workers and the environment. A new species of phorid-decapitating fly will be released at multiple sites in Tennessee as part of a USDA program to introduce IFA biological control agents to the U.S. One expected project outcome would be low cost and reduced-risk treatments for JB and IFA quarantines to improve sustainability of small-limited-use and large-scale nursery operations. A second expected project outcome would be establishments of a new phorid fly species in Tennessee, which may provide sustainable region-wide suppression of IFA populations, benefiting both nursery growers and all citizens in Tennessee and surrounding states. Project benefits will include improved, sustainable, and environmentally friendly quarantine pest management, as well as potential region-wide reductions in IFA populations, which are a human- and animal-health threat.',\n",

These outcomes will be a substantial contribution to the overall national goal of training beginning farmers and ranchers through the Beginning Farmer Rancher Development Program. To achieve the long-term goal of increased food security, beginning farmers must acquire skills and overcome barriers to enter into and succeed in agriculture. Well-established skill based training models assert that an individual must pass through a series of stages in order to move a certain skill from a beginning level to a more advanced level. Through this project LSP will apply what is known about the staged skills acquisition model to enhance current training and to pilot new approaches with the goal of increasing the rate of success of beginning farmers. Specifically 1200 beginning farmers will measurably improved their knowledge and skill in one or more of the following ways: utilizing beginning farmers resource and training opportunities through farmer-to-farmer network; improved management of production strategies including organic, rotational grazing, CSA and fruit production; addressing pre-farming risk and analyzing opportunities and assessing legal issues related to land purchases and leasing.

       " 'Cell type susceptibility and androgen independence: The pRb tumor suppressor pathway is frequently altered in human prostate cancer. Our previous studies in multiple cell types have demonstrated the importance of pRb in suppressing tumor initiation. We have developed a strategy to dominantly interfere with pRb and potentially compensatory related proteins p107 and p130 by cell specific expression of the SV40 T antigen domain (T121) that binds to and inactivates all three proteins. We utilized keratin regulation to generate transgenic mice with androgen-independent epithelial subtype- targeted expression of T121 in prostate epithelium.  In prostate, basal cells express K5 and K14, while luminal cells express K8 and K18. More recently, intermediate cells have been described with co expression of K5/18 and other keratins such as K15, 17 and 19. To explore the susceptible cell target(s), we used compartment-specific keratin gene transcriptional signals to drive expression of a conditional T121 allele composed of a reporter eGFP gene and stop sequences flanked by loxP sites upstream of T121 coding sequences. Specifically, K5, K18, and K19 genes were chosen to target basal cells, luminal cells, and intermediate cells in PE, respectively. To obtain optimal transgene expression, we have chosen to utilize a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring the keratin gene to generate transgenic mice. The use of BAC-trangene minimizes position effects associated with standard transgenes and increases the likelihood that all necessary regulatory elements will be present. The eGFP stop cassette and T121 gene will be inserted into the BACs using recombineering technology pioneered by Neal Copeland and colleagues, such that regulators of the keratin gene will also drive the expression of a conditional T121 allele. The subsequent introduction of Cre recombinase (via somatic viral delivery or a tissue-specific transgene) will remove the stop sequences and induce T121 expression.  All three strains of KeGT121 transgenic founder mice have been successfully generated (K5eGT121, K18eGT121, and K19eGT121). F1s have been used for mouse line characterization. Mice were also crossed to PbCre4 to activate T121 expression. To determine if tumor phenotype can be accelerated on Pten deficient background, we have crossed the mice on conditional Pten background.

Molecular genetic methods will be used to help characterize genetic diversity of the target weeds and determine their geographic origin, which are necessary to direct foreign exploration for prospective agents. Climatological analysis of the known geographic distribution of target weeds will predict potential geographic range for invasion in the USA. Field and laboratory experiments will be used to measure the environmental and economic impacts of these target weeds. With the assistance of foreign cooperators, we will discover prospective arthropod biological control agents for the above weed targets.

       " 'Energy intake is the most difficult part of the energy balance equation to measure.  Using an in patient computerized vending machine system, food intake has been measured over 180 individuals. In individuals undergoing the study more than once the intra-class correlation coefficient is very high (r=0.9) indicating that these studies although performed in an inpatient setting are very reproducible.  Eating during nighttime hours is a behavior that may predispose individuals to obesity. In our vending machine studies, we found that nearly 30% of volunteers ate from our vending machines during the night. These individuals consumed overall more calories and gained more weight over a 3 year follow-up period.  In addition, these individuals have higher respiratory quotients measured in our respiratory chamber while on a weight maintenance diet indicating an increased drive for food intake. Despite these differences, we have not found differences in anorexigenic or orexigenic hormone levels in these individuals.Higher respiratory quotient, the ratio of carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation, is known to predict weight gain. The mechanism of this increase in weight was thought to be secondary to a lower lipid oxidation in these individuals. Higher respiratory quotient measured during weight maintenance also predicted food intake during the ad-libitum vending machine study. However the component of respiratory quotient which best predicted food intake was higher carbohydrate oxidation indicating a role for carbohydrate (likely glycogen) balance in the regulation of short term food intake. To further investigate whether carbohydrate balance influences food intake, we fed individuals (in random order) a high fat versus high carbohydrate diet followed by ad libitum food intake. In preliminary analysis of 20 individuals, overall we did not find any difference in food consumption after either diet. However,  more obese individuals tended to eat more after the high fat compared with the high carbohydrate diet and the opposite was true in leaner individuals, indicating that adiposity is associated with alteration in responses to ingested macronutrients.Predictors of food intake in the past have demonstrated that individuals with lower fasting ghrelin concentrations (a hormone which is associated with increased food intake) actually ate more.  However, follow-up studies on a larger group of individuals did not show any association between total ghrelin concentrations and food intake. Furthermore, total ghrelin concentrations did not decrease with overfeeding, and change in ghrelin concentration did not predict subsequent food intake. This data indicates that ghrelin may not have a role in control of day to day food intake, nor is it suppressed by overeating. In order to evaluate this further, we evaluated the effect of short term (3 day) overfeeding compared with weight maintaining diets on both total and active ghrelin concentrations, physical activity and subsequent ad libitum food intake. We found that neither total or active ghrelin or food intake was reduced after overfeeding. However, during the overfeeding period, weight gain was associated with increased sedentary time indicating that physical activity may regulate weight gain during periods of overnutrition.',\n",
       " 'Salt marshes are extraordinarily productive ecosystems found in estuaries worldwide. Located between the coastal ocean and coastal watersheds, salt marshes are often heavily influenced by human activities. Many receive high nitrate input from land, degrading water quality and leading in some cases to harmful algal blooms and low oxygen zones harmful to fish. Previous research has shown that salt marshes can act as cleansing sites where pollutant nitrate can be transformed to harmless nitrogen gas and released to the atmosphere. This occurs through heterotrophic denitrification, a microbe-mediated process that transforms plant-available nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2) using organic carbon. However, this transformation to harmless nitrogen gas is not always the fate of salt marsh nitrate. More recent research suggests that the forms of sulfur and carbon compounds in the marsh sediment directly affect the types of microbes and their activities determining nitrate?s fate, i.e. sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon transformations are all linked via microbial activities. For example, instead of being converted to nitrogen gas, nitrate can be converted to ammonium via the microbially controlled process dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA). This different fate of nitrate is environmentally important in several ways. If nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas, it is lost from the ecosystem to the atmosphere, whereas if DNRA dominates nitrate reduction, pollutant nitrogen remains in the system as ammonium. Also, depending on the type of microbial process governing nitrate?s fate, if organisms are using nitrate to help degrade organic matter, less carbon is stored in the ecosystem, potentially influencing the ability of marshes to keep up with sea level rise. To investigate the environmental and microbial controls affecting the fate of nitrate in salt marshes, lab and field experiments will be carried out at Plum Island Estuary. The project focuses on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, a group of particularly important chemosynthetic microbes that use energy trapped in sulfur compounds in sediment to for energy production, and thus contribute to carbon storage. The proposed studies aim (1) to identify sulfur-oxidizers present in sediment densely populated with the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, and to examine their gene expression linked to sulfur and nitrate processing under shifting environmental conditions; and (2) to combine this molecular information with measurements of rates and characteristics of biogeochemical reactions occurring in the sediment to detect whether sulfur-oxidizer-linked DNRA (thus retention of nitrogen in the ecosystem) or denitrification (thus loss of nitrogen gas from the ecosystem) dominates under specific environmental conditions.Broader Impacts. This multidisciplinary research integrates biogeochemical process measurements with molecular analyses, and will be synergistic with ongoing studies at the Plum Island Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research (PIE-LTER) site. Salt marshes provide a variety of ecosystem services to humanity, including nutrient removal and storm protection, but they are under pressure from increasing coastal development and rising sea level.

The goal of XSEDE is to offer users tremendous capabilities with maximum productivity, enabling them to advance and share knowledge across domains. The XSEDE architecture, engineering, operations, support, and education activities are co-designed by an unparalleled team to achieve this goal, far surpassing TeraGrid in usability, reliability, capability, performance, and security?and ultimately, in user productivity and science impact. XSEDE will enable scientists, engineers, and educators to exploit powerful digital services and social networking environments to support knowledge exchange and advance understanding across domains. Just a few examples of the advances to science and society include: accurately predicting earthquake damage to urban structures; modeling of protein and nucleic acid folding and structure prediction to understand how drugs interact with target macromolecules to improve health care; developing novel designs for nanoscale microprocessors; advancing scientific understanding of plants to provide a safe and sustainable food supply, as well as benefits in renewable energy; and simulating pandemic spread to create a virtual laboratory where policy decisions such as school closure, vaccine deployment, and quarantine can be explored.  The XSEDE partnership will fulfill this vision by creating the most advanced, capable, and robust advanced digital cyberinfrastructure in the world?and supporting it with the most expert and experienced team of CI professionals. XSEDE will accelerate open scientific discovery and enable researchers, educators, and students across disciplines and across campuses to conduct transformational research efforts and innovative education programs. XSEDE will create strong ties with campus personnel spanning technology, workforce development, and policy issues to enhance CI for research and education. Researchers will use XSEDE directly, from campus and personal systems, from other high-end centers and cyberinfrastructure resources, and via science gateways and discovery environments. XSEDE users will be backed by an integrated national user support program offering an array of services from experts in the application of technology to advance science and engineering, including extensive training and advanced user support and collaboration. XSEDE?s governance model will include participation by these users as stakeholders, while providing centralized management to ensure robustness and to facilitate rapid responses to new issues and opportunities.  XSEDE will carry out a multifaceted Training, Education, and Outreach Services (TEOS) program to raise the competency of the present and future scientific community. XSEDE will work proactively with the nation?s educational institutions to create a significantly larger and more diverse STEM workforce. TEOS will broaden participation by working with under-represented faculty and students to engage larger numbers of under-represented individuals from among minority-serving and EPSCoR institutions, women, and people with disabilities. TEOS will disseminate best practices, lessons learned, and quality materials and will leverage external partnerships to scale-up successful practices. XSEDE will leverage the XD Technology Insertion Service (TIS) activities?already awarded to the XSEDE team?into continuously advancing CI and will work closely with the Technology Audit Service (TAS) team to ensure that XSEDE can be effectively evaluated and improved. These activities will ensure that XSEDE is robust, easy to use, performing as designed, and evolving constantly to meet the growing demands of scientific research and researchers.  Advancing science with the most powerful, diverse, and integrated set of advanced digital services ever?and linking that to other CI projects and to campuses and local research infrastructure?is unprecedented.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Silvia Newell is  Activity of nitrogen fixers and denitrifiers in coastal sediments.  The host institution for this fellowship is Boston University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Robinson Fulweiler.Coastal systems are acutely vulnerable to nitrogen pollution, resulting in wide-spread reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia), decreased biodiversity,  and increased harmful algal blooms.  Nitrogen loading from wastewater into Waquoit Bay is documented and has more than doubled since 1938. Hypoxia in eutrophic coastal ecosystems can also stimulate puzzling microbial responses, including high rates of simultaneous denitrification (nitrogen removal) and nitrogen fixation.  Continuing to fix nitrogen when fixed nitrogen is available is energetically unfavorable and leads to the central questions of this research: Why do bacteria turn on nitrogen fixation under nitrogen-replete conditions? Can nitrogen fixation exacerbate eutrophication and greenhouse gas production?  This research investigates the distributions and activities of denitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria within the sediment to determine if the patterns are consistent with the existence of highly localized, very rapid nitrogen transformations. Training objectives include learning techniques of biogeochemistry including core incubation and isotope methods. Broader impacts include participation in the Women in Science program for 12-14 year olds at the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, as well as outreach to local minority-serving high schools.',\n",

Traditionally, denitrification was thought to occur mostly in surface soils, but recent evidence suggests that deeper soils can also play an important role in the nitrogen cycle.   This project will conduct a series of experiments to assess the rates of denitrification from deep soils and how this affected by specific agricultural practices.Denitrification represents one of the major pathways that biologically available nitrogen leaves terrestrial ecosystems, along with leaching, volatilization, and runoff, and is the only process capable of returning nitrogen to its inert form of dinitrogen gas.

This feature is considered the major evolutionary innovation that allowed for the evolution of the diversity of fishes, which include more species than all other vertebrates together.  Interestingly, not all fishes produce this complex feature in the same way.  This project assesses how development may constrain or liberate the evolution of complexity and tests hypotheses about convergent function generated by divergent developmental mechanisms, and performance consequences.  This proposal directly addresses the question of why certain forms repeat in nature, while others do not appear.  This research will address the following questions: (1) How do different developmental mechanisms generate convergent function? (2) What is the performance advantage of upper jaw protrusion? (3) Are there performance consequences for the different underlying mechanisms?  In answering these questions this research will determine the extent to which fishes are constrained by development, and how they may escape these constraints.The Broader Impacts of this research are strong, including a PI that is a beginning investigator, one that is a member of a group underrepresented in Biology, and the training of diverse students, especially undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution.',\n",

       " 'This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel surveillance system based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) technologies for Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) bacterium and Candidatus Liberibacter species. Early and accurate detection of HLB pathogens in infected asymptomatic citrus plants is a crucial step for implementing timely measures to eliminate bacterial infections and prevent further epidemic spread among crops. Current detection methods such as conventional PCR may not provide the sensitivity needed for asymptomatic citrus samples. Nested-PCR is costly and time-consuming, and more importantly, has a high risk of cross-contamination.  In this proposal, we propose to develop a novel surveillance system, a single-tube nested real-time PCR for ultrasensitive detection of HLB Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus in the citrus samples with extremely low bacterial titer. With the proposed technology, the PCR assay procedure is greatly simplified, and the cost of processing each sample is significantly reduced. This makes it possible to process large numbers of samples in a relative short time period in a high through-put diagnostic system. This system will be designed to provide a useful and accurate diagnostic tool for the management and prevention of HLB diseases. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable diagnostic system to meet the challenges and demands for sensitive and cost-effective detection of HLB, currently the most devastating disease of citrus. The final product of the surveillance system is a single-tube nested-PCR test kit for sensitive detection of HLB pathogen.  The HLB diagnostic kit will include all assay components in a ready-to-use format, which allows an entire PCR assay, from target RNA amplification to amplicon detection, to be performed in a single reaction tube. A prototype assay system will be developed in Phase I, and will be optimized and validated with field samples in Phase II. The goal of this proposal is to develop the HLB surveillance system with sensitive, reliable and user-friendly commercial products for HLB detection and monitoring. This HLB assay system will be useful in national citrus certification programs, plant diagnostic network systems, pathogen elimination programs, state and federal plant quarantine programs, as well as routine application in research and diagnostic laboratories.',\n",
       " 'Ubiquitous in soils, streptomycetes are bacteria from which we derive more than half of all clinically useful bioactive compounds. However, we lack a coherent taxonomic framework to explain the ecological and evolutionary significance of antibiotic production in the genus. Horizontal gene exchange is hypothesized to be profound within certain bacterial lineages and is expected to explain taxonomic challenges in Streptomyces. This project will examine genetic diversity in the genus Streptomyces and the evolutionary forces that generate these patterns. The project is transformational in that it examines a new paradigm for understanding the evolutionary history of streptomycetes. This new paradigm should have a dramatic impact on our understanding of microbial evolution and the evolution of antibiotic production.Our limited knowledge of the evolutionary history of Streptomyces bacteria has impeded progress in understanding the evolution of antibiotics. Information on the biogeography and evolution of Streptomyces should promote development of rational sampling strategies for discovering diverse strains and novel bioactive compounds.

       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex required increased production of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The balance between excitation and inhibition is critical for normal neurological function, and yet we know little about the human-specific genetic changes underlying increased neurogenesis. The recent availability of complete genome sequence from humans and a diverse range of mammals makes large scale sequence comparisons possible. Regulatory elements that are conserved in other mammals, but surprisingly missing in humans could contribute to human specific biology. Initial work on the project shows that humans have lost a forebrain specific regulatory element in zones of inhibitory interneuron production near the tumor suppressor gene GADD45g, which is specifically expressed in neural progenitors during development. GADD45g represses cell cycle in culture and GADD45g down-regulation is strongly associated with pituitary adenomas, yet the function of GADD45g in nervous system development has not yet been explored. This project will characterize in detail the neuronal lineages affected by the human specific genetic change using genetic labeling techniques in mouse stable lines expressing Cre-recombinase driven by the enhancer missing in humans. To put the mouse expression data in the context of changes in primate gene regulation, this project will also identify the upstream regulators of the DNA sequence that is missing in humans. Finally, this project will characterize how loss of the GADD45g gene affects brain development in mouse using an existing knockout line not previously analyzed for nervous system phenotypes. Collectively, these experiments will provide an in depth study of how a human- specific genetic change may contribute to specialized aspects of human brain development.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health because GADD45g mis-regulation is strongly associated with multiple cancers including pituitary adenomas, a major form of brain cancer. Additionally, the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition is critical for normal neurological function and may be disrupted in disorders as diverse as epilepsy, Down's syndrome and autism. Identifying how human specific genetic changes regulating GADD45g expression affect the production of inhibitory interneurons may both aid in understanding the role of GADD45g in human brain tumors, and in understanding uniquely human aspects of inhibitory neuron production.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All linear double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses package their genome into a preformed procapsid via an ATP-driving motor. The central component of the phi29 DNA-packaging motor is the portal connector composed of twelve copies of the protein gp10, which form a dodecamer channel that acts as a pathway for the translocation of dsDNA. With a diameter of 3.6 nm at its narrowest end, it is one of the largest among typical channel proteins that have been incorporated into lipid membranes. Explicit engineering and pore modifications of the phi29 connector are possible due to its available crystal structure, thus inspiring the use of such a system as a module in biomedical applications or nanodevices.  The short-term objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the utility of the lipid-embedded channel of the phi29 DNA packaging motor as a highly sensitive device for capture and fingerprinting of chemicals and biopolymers in real time at single molecule resolution using electrophysiological assays. The connector will be reengineered for added functionality and various approaches will be undertaken to modulate the dimensions of the pore. Alteration of the charge distributions will be made by mutagenesis in a controlled fashion to ensure optimal sensing. The channel will be designed to act as a stochastic biosensor and functionalized with recognition groups to bind various analytes of interest. Methods to increase the stability and lifetime of the lipid/connector complex will be developed to facilitate high throughput electrophysiological measurement of a single pore with provisions for rapid and efficient sample and buffer exchange. The long-term objective is to develop the channel into a robust sensing device for detecting biomolecules or chemicals at extremely low concentrations in the presence of many contaminants for a wide range of applications in biotechnology, earlier disease diagnosis, environmental surveillance, custom quarantine, drug testing and national security.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The membrane embedded nanopore of bacteriophage phi29 biomotor will be reengineered, characterized and developed into a single pore sensor for detection of biomolecules and chemicals. The combination of capture and fingerprinting with multiple identification parameters for single molecule detection in real time will make the system highly sensitive to detect molecules at extremely low concentrations in the presence of many contaminants.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of our proposal is to enhance the nation's public health response capability by quantifying agent-based model uncertainty and the impact of behavioral modification on the spread of infectious diseases. Our goal is to improve the understanding of the impact of emergent behavior on the accuracy and applicability of predictive models of disease spread. We will evaluate the implications of uncertainty in human and population behavioral response to a pandemic in mathematical model formulations. This foundational understanding will help improve all existing epidemiological models thereby potentiating the ability of public health practitioners and policy-makers to effectively manage a burgeoning epidemic regardless of the tool being used. We will leverage existing epidemiologic and behavioral simulation infrastructure to develop new mathematical approaches to incorporate different types of diseases and behavioral changes alone and in combination with other intervention strategies. We will validate the models and quantify sensitivity of computational models to parameters, and known disease spread patterns. These models will be constructed for use in estimating prevalence and incidence and will allow us to compare systematically the relative effects of preventive measures, such as behavioral changes, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination. First, we will develop novel approaches to characterize emergent behavior and extend the mathematical foundation and software infrastructure for modeling behavior changes in response to an epidemic. Secondly, we will quantify the epidemic progression uncertainty caused by the distribution of behavioral responses. These behavioral models will be implemented and validated in an existing high-fidelity agent-based activity simulator model. Finally, we will disseminate these advances so they can be useful, and used, in other epidemiological simulations.     RELEVANCE: The data for an ongoing epidemic is sparse, inexact, and often just unavailable. Therefore, quantifying parameter and computational uncertainties is crucial for forecasting the impact of disease spread. We cannot assume impact of the uncertain parameters is negligible; especially when decisions based on the model will impact the lives of countless people. One of the fundamental limitations of the current models is in how well they capture changes in human behavior in response to an ongoing endemic.\",\n",

Rodents currently housed in the adjacent Clinical Sciences Center (CSC) will be moved into WIMR following successful embryo or cesarean rederivation. This move will leave the UW with an older animal facility that can be repurposed into a much needed rodent containment and quarantine area. The refurbished facility will serve as a core resource on the UW campus and will be utilized by over 337 researchers impacting more than $349 million in research funds. The proposed changes to the CSC space include the purchase of: high-density rodent housing racks, bio- safety cabinets, laboratory/procedure tables, anesthesia machines, some minor renovation, and modernization of the facility's HVAC system. The renovated facility will have five main uses: (1) Serve as a containment area for any rodent colony in an specific pathogen free facility that becomes contaminated with a rodent pathogen. (2) Allow researchers space within the footprint of the facility for rodent manipulation in newly outfitted procedure rooms. (3) Create space for pilot studies prior to incurring cost and time delays associated with rederivation procedures. (4) Allow the UW flexibility in acquiring valuable rodent lines from non-rederived sources for pilot studies.

MBP focuses on expanding knowledge ofthe biology of laboratory mice and on the application of genetically-altered mice in biomedical research. Among the many projects relying on MBP support and vivarium services are the NIH/NCRR's Mutant Mouse Regional Resources Centers (MMRRC) and the trans-NIH Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository. MBP is already engaged in working with investigators around the globe coordinating rodent imports and exports; creating, expanding and cryoarchiving lines of genetically altered mice; assisting research planning using genetically altered mice (age, gender, number, genetic background, special husbandry requirements, etc); and providing stewardship and oversight of animal care and health for all mice housed in MBP.

The Animal Care Core has implemented an expedited quarantine program that has been effect for the past 9 years. This has successfully decreased the quarantine time and allowed phenotyping to begin while animals are within quarantine, allowing animals to be studied at younger ages and minimizing costs associated with the phenotyping process. The Core will: 1) import mice for metabolic phenotyping, 2) determine the microbiological profile of each imported cohort and provide the Center Director with interpretation and advice about the results, 3) provide stable, biocontainment housing, husbandry and health care for mice submitted to the Center, 4) provide a dedicated, biosecure suite of room for quarantine, housing and on-site phenotyping procedures, 5) perform morphological phenotyping as requested, 6) provide to Center clients results and advice on the health status of submitted mice. The facilities include 600 ft^ of dedicated biocontainment housing and procedure space equipped with 160 cage ventilated rack, an NMR analyzer, and 8 metabolic (calorimetry) cages.

Despite indications that the therapeutic effects of CO inpreventing tissue injury may involve anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects, themechanism(s) by which CO impacts cellular homeostasis remains incompletely understood.

However, the mechanisms underlying this antiviral effect are still poorly understood. In a recent study (Klatt, PloS Pathogens 2010), we found that, in both early and late SIV infection, depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes does not change the vivo lifespan of infected cell, thus indicating that SIV suppression mediate by CD8+ lymphocytes may involve direct cytolythic effects as well as non-cytolythic mechanisms.

In contrast, non-progressive SIV infection of sooty mangabeys (SMs) is characterized by preservation of CD4+ T cell counts. The mechanisms responsible for the differential ability to maintain CD4+ T cell homeostasis in SMs versus RMs are currently unknown. Scope of this recently awarded work is to elucidate the cellular and molecular basis for this divergent phenotype. Specific aims include the identification of species-specific features of CD4+ T cell reconstitution following antibody-mediated depletion of CD4 lymphocytes in vivo, and the definition of homeostatic regulation of a number of CD4+ T cell subsets that play a crucial role in the context of HIV/SIV infection, such as central memory, Th17, IL-21 producing cells. The project was funded in September 2010, and we are currently in the planning phase of the complex in vivo experiments included in Aim 1, in which 6 healthy RM will be treated with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. We recently identified the 6 animals that have been already under quarantine and now assigned to the study. As such, we will soon start the proposed treatment aimed at depleting their CD4+ cells and then at investigating longitudinally the phenotypical, functional, and molecular profile of CD4+ T cells that proliferate in response to this depletion.\",\n",

To accommodate this growth, we have aggressively pursued funding from multiple sources to renovate and expand existing facilities and have been successful in securing roughly $50 million from multiple sources to:1) construct new animal holding facilities to include space for research, indoor animal housing for breeding colony animals, and clinic space (estimated completion first quarter of 2011), 2) construct a new quarantine building (completed September 2009), 3) upgrade existing security (completed summer 2009), 4) build a Regional Biosafety Laboratory (RBL) (commissioning completed February 2010), 5) purchase caging, 6) construct new BSL-2 necropsy facility (completed fall 2010) and 7) construct freezer storage space and rconvert existing storage space to laboratory space. Completion of these projects will greatly increase the amount of our research space as well as the needed infrastructure to support our research program. Our success in obtaining this funding was facilitated by the development of a TNPRC strategic plan and a campus master plan. We are in the process of updating the campus master plan.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza transmission between humans is poorly understood. Although it is known that the human cough or sneeze produces particles in a continuum from 1000um diameter, the relative contribution of particles of differing sizes is unresolved. Current uncertainty has made the development of evidence-based infection control guidance difficult; the single most problematic issue being whether healthcare workers should wear surgical face-masks or N95 respirators when caring for influenza patients, i.e. whether droplet sprays (> 10um diameter) or droplet nuclei (<10um) pose the greatest hazard. The Overall Objective is: to determine the relative importance of droplet nuclei in the transmission of influenza by using a quarantine-based human challenge model. Specific Aims are: To describe the distribution and infectious potential of respiratory particles of different sizes obtained from patients infected with naturally acquired influenza compared with volunteers deliberately infected with a wild-type influenza A/H3N2 virus; To study human-human transmission from volunteers deliberately infected with a wild- type influenza (donors) to susceptible volunteers (recipients), exposed under close living condition, with recipients randomized to no intervention or face-shields and hand hygiene to allow selective exposure to droplet nuclei only; To determine the secondary attack rate in recipients exposed 'unprotected' to infected donors, versus the secondary attack rates in recipients in whom exposure is only possible via droplet nuclei In a series of secure quarantines we will challenge healthy susceptible volunteers (donors) with a wild-type (GMQ) A/H3N2 virus by nasal inoculation. After donors' symptoms develop, we will expose other susceptible volunteers (recipients) for three days under close 'household-like' conditions, during which time recipients will be randomized to wear face-shields and practice hand hygiene, versus no intervention (controls). Secondary attack rates will be measured by PCR, culture and serology. We will standardize the environment (temperature and humidity) to optimize influenza transmission, and study in detail the aerobiological environment via sampling of exhaled breath and room air, and the touched environment via surface swabbing.\",\n",

       " 'The cerambycid beetles comprise one of the largest (>33,000 described species) and most variable insect families. Many species are ecologically important because they aid in the breakdown and recycling of woody plants by boring within dead, dying, and decaying wood, opening up the resource for other insects and microorganisms. However, the family also includes species which are among the most important insect pests of woody plants in natural and managed ecosystems worldwide. Because the larvae of many cerambycid species are long-lived and develop in woody tissues, they are readily moved around the world by global commerce when infesting wooden dunnage, packing cases, and shipping palettes. They are among the most common potentially invasive species intercepted in international quarantine. Whereas they may be insignificant as pests in their native countries, species can multiply rapidly and quickly reach major pest status in novel environments that are largely free of coevolved natural enemies. Several major pest species have recently invaded and become established in North America, including the notorious Asian longhorned borer, the Japanese cedar longhorn beetle, and the brown spruce beetle. From past history, it is clear that numerous exotic cerambycid species will reach North America in the near future, and that given the diversity of available hosts, habitats, and climatic regions, many could become established. Exacerbating the problem, the ability of regulatory agencies to exclude dangerous cerambycids (and some other taxonomic groups) is severely limited by the lack of efficient tools for their detection and interception. This deficiency was recognized in the recent USDA position paper,  A Dynamic Invasive Species Research Vision: Opportunities and Priorities 2009-29  , which explicitly identified prevention and prediction, early detection, and rapid response as prioritized areas for increased funding and research. The ever-increasing pressure from alien species represents a major threat to both natural and agricultural ecosystems throughout the country. The aims of this proposal are to develop a sound understanding of the roles of pheromones and host odors as attractants for cerambycid beetles, and to exploit that knowledge for surveillance and management of these insects. These aims directly address AFRI Foundational Program Priority Area 1 (Plant health and production, plant products) by improving management strategies for economically important insect pests of both urban and agroforestry that are of national, regional, and multi-state importance, and by focusing on signaling mechanisms and communication, and chemical interactions among insect pests. The project will be leveraged by collaborations with colleagues in Asia, South America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, who are screening our cerambycid pheromone libraries in their countries. Overall, these studies will allow us to optimize lures for invasive species for use by US regulatory agencies on an ongoing basis, while also building strong links with foreign colleagues which will be enormously useful for future work on invasive species.',\n",
       " \"Situation: Honey bees provide great benefits to humanity, both in the form of useful hive products such as honey and wax, but even more importantly, as pollinators of a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, oil, and nut crops. Crops that are predominantly pollinated by honeybees have an estimated value of more than $215 billion worldwide, and bees are thought to be responsible for every third bite of food we eat. Disturbingly, the number of honey bee hives in the U.S. has declined sharply in recent decades, from 6 million after World War II, to 2.4 million today. In fact, pollinators are in decline worldwide, creating a pollination deficit for agricultural production. On top of the existing pollinator crisis, since 2006 huge numbers of U.S. honey bee colonies have been lost to a mysterious new malady, 'Colony Collapse Disorder' (CCD). This disorder is diagnosed by colony abandonment by adult worker bees. Since the onset of CCD, annual colony losses have doubled in many areas of the U.S., creating a new urgency to the pollination crisis faced in agriculture. There have been many recent studies that have attempted to identify the causes of CCD. Collapsed colonies turn out to have numerous problems, including more diseases (including fungus, bacteria, and viruses), parasitic mites, and pesticide residues. CCD is more likely to occur in colonies found in disturbed urban or agricultural landscapes, rather than in open land habitats with abundant and diverse floral food sources. However, despite all the research, there is still no 'silver bullet' -- no study to date has been able to pin down the actual cause of CCD. In fact, the only thing researchers can agree on is that CCD must be caused by a combination of several factors. Purpose: In this project, we propose to test a new hypothesis for CCD. It focuses on the negative effects of two critical factors to bee health: infection with multiple viruses and nutritional stress. We hypothesize that bees under nutritional stress leave the hive in search of food, but are unable to return due to negative effects of being infected with viruses, such as paralysis. When bees fail to return to their hives, their colonies produce new foragers, who may then meet the same fate. This cycle of bees leaving the hive and failing to return could quickly lead to the sudden 'disappearance' of worker bees, the diagnostic symptom of CCD. We will use a combination of laboratory and field-based studies to examine the effects of three viruses and nutritional stress on worker bees and their colonies. We will determine whether these two negative factors together can cause the symptoms of CCD. We will be specifically looking for higher loads of viruses, hive abandonment behavior, diagnostic patterns of gene activity, and ultimately, hive death. These findings may lead to changes in apicultural management, such as: more informed virus quarantine practices, colony supplementation with multi-source pollen when bees are nutritionally stressed, allowing bees to forage on crops of high nutritional value after low, and encouraging farmers and beekeepers to use land management practices that increase floral diversity.\",\n",
       " 'Pathogens and pests can be the most important constraints on crop yields. They can also poison food supplies by contributing to mycotoxin contamination. Genetic resistance is the preferred solution because of its low cost and ease of deployment but often resistance is futile. The short generation time and large populations of pathogens and pests enable them to evolve new races that overcome resistance. They similarly overcome pesticides. Many biotic threats to US crops are controlled solely by quarantine. Clearly there is a need to understand crop immune systems sufficiently so that stable, artificial immunity can be generated and deployed. In plants the natural sensors that detect infection produce weak signals but these are amplified to an effective level by a poorly understood mechanism. Our project is focused on understanding how the signals are amplified. The amplification mechanism is based on the creation and detection of specific plant peptides. We will study both creation and detection and we will validate our findings by attempting to generate stable, artificial immunity in maize to fungal infection. Validated findings should be broadly applicable to the other grass crops including wheat, rice, sugarcane, barley, oats, switchgrass, and Miscanthus.',\n",

These include: Limited educational background; Language barriers and cultural differences; Unfamiliarity with farming in the Pacific Northwest and organic production practices; Lack of culturally relevant educational opportunities; Isolation from social and professional networks; Inadequate access to capital; Difficulties accessing land; and Lack of experience and technical assistance in management and marketing. At the heart of this project is the idea that participating farmers learn best how to operate a small farm by actually operating, in a supportive environment, a small farm, and they learn good business practices by actually running a small agricultural business. This learn-by-doing concept has already proven successful by our project partner, the California based Agriculture and Land Based Training Association (ALBA). Following the ABLA model, the Organic Farming Education Program (OFEP) graduates present business plans in order to be eligible lease land at subsidized rates on the Incubator. Once in the incubator, farmers have access to equipment and utilities at subsidized rates. First year farmers start out with small plots of land. Those plot sizes increase, and the subsidies decrease, in years 2-7 as the participating farmer demonstrates competency through annually renewed business plans and farming and marketing successes. Once a farmer feels ready to farm independently, incubator staff provide assistance in finding appropriate land, continued educational opportunities, technical assistance, and help accessing markets.',\n",
       " 'This research problem area will develop basic biological and ecological information about invasive insects, diseases, and plants (collectively pests) that are currently in the United States.  This change of knowledge will allow scientists, managers, and citizens to develop control treatments and management tactics for these pests. We will also develop information on how these pests damage our native forests and what those damages cost us.  This information will allow managers and policymakers to change conditions by funding management programs to reduce the costs of those damages. Objective(s): This problem area focuses on research on invasive insects, pathogens, and plants that are already established in the U.S. Lack of knowledge of biology and ecology of these established species is a major barrier to their control and management. Quantifying the ecological effects and socio-economic impacts of invasive species is often critical for obtaining sufficient support to implement management programs. The unit has existing partnerships with university, state, local, and federal agencies, international governments and organizations, non-governmental organizations, and private sector cooperators to develop the needed information. The research will provide the basic biological and ecological information needed to develop control and management actions. The development of ecological effects and socio-economic impacts will provide information to managers and policymakers to enable the development and funding of management programs. Approach:  Our research approach uses a combination of laboratory (including quarantine), field and theoretical studies, landscape and regional scale impact studies, and modeling efforts to improve understanding of invasive species biology, life history, host range, ecology, reproductive behavior, seasonal phenology, genetic architecture, mechanisms of invasion, and population dynamics. Successional dynamics and short and long term changes in biodiversity and species composition of invaded forests provide ecological information on which social and economic effects can be evaluated. In particular, studies in our quarantine facility or overseas in an organisms native range, conducted with international cooperators, are critical components of the research approach. Key research subjects are invasive insect species (Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, gypsy moth, hemlock woolly adelgid, Sirex woodwasp), pathogens (beech bark disease, butternut canker, chestnut blight, and sudden oak death), and plants (tree of heaven and Japanese stiltgrass).',\n",
       " 'This research problem area will develop information about invasive insects, diseases, and plants (collectively potential pests) that are currently not present in the United States.  This change of knowledge will allow scientists, managers, and citizens to develop risk assessments for these potential pests. The risk assessments will allow scientists and managers to prioritize potential pests and develop programs to prevent their introduction.  This information will allow managers and policymakers to change conditions by funding preventative programs to reduce the introduction of potential pests. Objective(s): This problem area focuses on research on species which are not yet established in the U.S. but, based on risk assessments, are threats to our forests if introduced.  Some of this research involves work with international cooperators to identify potential invasive species and to collect information for conducting risk assessments and prioritizing species for management actions like quarantine and detection surveys.  Risk assessments point out that it is much less costly (ecologically and economically) to prevent introduction and establishment than to deal with the species after it is established. Our objective is to develop methodologies to predict which insect, pathogen, and plant species will likely become invasive as well as protocols to prevent their entry.  Wood packaging material used in international trade is recognized as a key pathway for the introduction of bark- and wood-infesting species.  Research on new treatments and the role of bark in post-treatment infestation by insects will allow development of improved treatments and international standards for wood packaging.  Our work in these areas provides information that state, national, and international regulatory agencies can use to conduct risk assessments, select species for detection surveys, and develop regulatory quarantines and standards. Approach:  Our research approach is to: 1) maintain our quarantine facility for conducting biological research studies on high-priority non-native species (insect, pathogen, plant); 2) identify non-native species that pose a significant threat to U.S. forests but are not yet established based on their interception frequency at ports of entry and pest status throughout their current range; 3) determine key pathways of introduction by non-native species; 4) develop and test treatments to reduce insects and pathogens in wood packaging materials; 5) work with overseas cooperators to determine the potential risk posed by species not yet introduced to the U.S.; and 6) studying invasive species prior to establishment allows for improved risk assessment and early testing of control tactics. We will conduct our work in cooperation with other federal agencies (e.g., USDA APHIS and ARS), international programs aimed at reducing pest invasions [EXFOR (Exotic Forest Pest Information System for North America), IFQRG (International Forestry Quarantine Research Group), IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention), and NAPPO (North American Plant Protection Organization)], and research scientists located in regions where high risk species are native.',\n",
       " 'This research problem area will develop ways to control and manage invasive insects, diseases, and plants (collectively pests) across the various stages of invasion.  Economics and other science-based tools will be used to help managers and policymakers decide what types of control and management are feasible for these pests.  The methods will provide information that will allow managers and policymakers to change conditions by funding programs to control and manage invasive pests. Objective(s): This problem area focuses on research for controlling and managing invasive species arrival, establishment, spread, and long-term persistence, with particular attention to post-arrival stages. In addition, research on restoration of ecosystems affected by invasive species is a major component of managing long-term persistence. Management research includes not only work on developing specific control tactics such as biological control, chemical control, host resistance, and silviculture, but also includes work on integration of control tactics into decision support tools and systems to optimize management like integrated pest management approaches. Invasive species cause significant environmental damage to ecosystems and surrounding areas.  Corresponding to the arrival, establishment, spread, and long-term persistence of invasive species are specific types of management procedures for each of these stages which our research supports: quarantine and inspection to prevent arrival; detection and eradication to stop establishment; barrier zones to stop, slow, or reverse the spread of invasive species; and finally chemical control, biological control, selection of resistant host plants, silvicultural treatments, and other options to manage invasive species that have become established.  Restoration of damaged areas is an additional important component of invasive species management that allows ecosystem function to persist. Approach:  Our research approach includes three major areas: 1) control tools, 2) management tactics, and 3) decision support and integrated pest management (IPM). Control tools include: improving rearing methods for invasive insects; improving rearing methods parasites and predators for biological control; continuing foreign exploration for additional biological control agents; evaluating endemic natural enemies for biological control; developing preventative quarantine treatments; evaluating biological control agent effectiveness; testing pesticide treatments; breeding resistance hosts; and developing treatments for firewood and wood packaging material. Management tactics include: adapting theoretical models to investigate new approaches to eradicating species invasions; conducting long-term and establishing new research studies on silvicultural approaches to mitigating invasive species impacts; developing eradication/containment strategies based on population biology principles; and developing integrated treatments. Decision support and IPM tools include: refining and managing the gypsy moth Slow-the-Spread decision support model; analyzing economic implications of strategies to mitigate establishment and spread of non-native invasive species; and integrating social, economic, and treatment efficacy into IPM systems.The Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) has placed a renewed emphasis on the use of silvicultural treatments to increase forest health in relation to insects and pathogens, and we have increased our research efforts in support of HFRA large-scale silvicultural assessments for a number of insects and pathogens, especially non-native invasive species. In addition, the Forest Service signed a MOU with The American Chestnut Foundation to restore blight-resistant American chestnut to the National Forests. We will work to develop basic silvics information about American chestnut and silvicultural guidelines for its restoration in native forests.

These methods will allow scientists, managers, and citizens to find and identify pests and have the tools to better control and manage them. The methods will provide information that will allow managers and policymakers to change conditions by funding programs to eliminate and reduce the spread of pests. Objective(s): This problem area focuses on research on species that have arrived in the U.S., but can also apply to species not yet here. Here the emphasis is on the development of methods for detecting, identifying, and monitoring rather than on the biology and ecology of the invasive species. These methods can improve early detection techniques for monitoring spread,  improve understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics,  identify semiochemicals for host- and mate-finding behaviors; improve identification methods; determine current forest conditions in terms of distribution and spread of known and potentially invasive plant species; develop population, community, and landscape-level models of forest susceptibility/vulnerability to invasion, and enhance our understanding of the establishment and spread dynamics of invading populations.  All of these methods can be used to improve detection and management guidelines. Approach:  Our research approach includes: 1) examining the spatial and temporal variation of invading non-native species, 2) investigating the susceptibility of forests to invasion by insects, pathogens, and plants, 3) utilizing our insect quarantine lab to develop and evaluate detection methods and control treatments for invasive species not yet established or with limited ranges in the U.S.; 4) utilizing our state-of-the-art gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer, and electro-antenogram equipment for identifying insect semiochemicals and developing traps for detection and monitoring; and 5) developing genetic tools for identifying invasive species and varieties.

Release and evaluate tamarisk leaf beetles (Diorhabda spp.) at sites in the LRGB that contain mainly T. ramosissima and T. chinensis saltcedar, and assess effects on exotic athel trees, Mexican Frankenia species, and native vegetation. Subobjective 2B. Release and evaluate Diorhabda tamarisk beetles for biological control of Tamarix canariensis/T. gallica at coastal sites. Subobjective 2C. Discover and evaluate new agents from the western Mediterranean for biological control of saltcedar. Objective 3: Begin initial foreign exploration and feasibility studies for biological control of guineagrass and elephant ear. Subobjective 3A. Begin initial foreign exploration and feasibility studies for biological control of guineagrass, and determine the distribution and impact of this plant in the LRGB and other watersheds. Subobjective 3B. Begin initial foreign exploration and feasibility studies for biological control of elephant ear, and determine the distribution of this plant in the LRGB and other southwestern watersheds.Approach:Giant reed, saltcedar, guineagrass, and elephant ear are invasive, non-native weeds that compete for scarce water resources in arid regions facing critical water shortages for agricultural, municipal, and environmental uses and, in addition, cause many other ecological and economic problems in the Lower Rio Grande Basin (LRGB) of Texas and northern Mexico.  The LRGB is the largest watershed in North America, and biological control of these important riparian and terrestrial weeds has not been developed. This project will discover, evaluate, and implement multiple biological control agents to control giant reed along the Rio Grande and throughout the LRGB. Remote sensing and land-based field studies will be used to measure the impact of a biological control program on vegetation change and water use.  The project will also evaluate the field efficacy of tamarisk leaf beetles to control saltcedar in south Texas rangelands and coastal grasslands, areas not previously subjected to biological control, as well as evaluate potential non-target effects on related native plants that are relevant to future biological control of saltcedar in Mexico. In addition, the feasibility for biological control of guineagrass, an invasive, fire-promoting weed in LRGB agriculture and rangelands, and of elephant ear, a large, leafy plant that invades the edges of rivers and reservoirs, will be determined by compiling information on the distribution, impact, and uses of these weeds along with preliminary information from the literature and initial explorations for potential biological control agents. This research will produce environmental and economic benefits by conserving water resources associated with giant reed and saltcedar infestations of the LRGB, and by defining new weed targets to achieve further water savings in the future.',\n",

       " 'Dairy cattle consume large quantities of feed nitrogen to support milk production, reproduction and growth. If feed nitrogen is consumed in excess of the animal requirements for these functions, it is excreted via the manure. Typically, 20 to 35% of the consumed feed nitrogen is contained in the milk. This implies that 65 to 80% of the consumed feed nitrogen nis excreted in the manure. The nitrogen in the manure is found in 2 fractions. One is the fecal fraction while the other is the urine fraction. Research has indicated that fecal nitrogen excretion is fairly constant across a wide range of nitrogen intakes. However, urinary nitrogen excretion does increase as addition feed nitrogen is fed in excess of animal requirements. The potential ammonia emissions in a dairy herd are highly correlated with urinary nitrogen excretion. The goal of this project is to lower ration nitrogen intake through the use of the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model. This model has the capability to improve nitrogen use efficiency in the dairy cow by optimizing rumen fermentation and microbial protein synthesis. Feed nitrogen intake can be reduced as more microbial protein is produced in the rumen to meet the amino acid needs in the intestine for milk protein synthesis. Preliminary on-farm demonstration projects indicate that using the CNCPS model to lower feed nitrogen intake does not affect the level of milk production. Manure nitrogen excretion is reduced, feed nitrogen use efficiency is improved and farm profitability is increased. The actual magnitude of these changes will vary depending on the level of feed nitrogen being fed relative to requirements. A decrease in manure nitrogen nexcretion of 10-25 % is realistic in many herds. This would be equivalent to a decrease in ammonia emissions of 20 to 50%.',\n",

       " 'Objective(s): The long term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S. export markets for fresh tropical commodities with emphasis on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality and food safety, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states. Our research will address three objectives over the next 5 years: (1) Develop new or improved postharvest treatments, including alternatives to methyl bromide, for tropical fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crop exports to ensure security against quarantine pests and to meet quarantine requirements of U.S. trading partners; (2) Develop new or improved postharvest treatments for tropical fruit, vegetable, nut and ornamental crops to improve product quality and shelf life, reduce or eliminate postharvest disorders or decay, and enhance product value; and (3) Identify, develop or improve preharvest methods for tropical fruit, vegetable, nut, and ornamental crops that enhance postharvest quality and reduce the incidence of quarantine pests that limit exports.Approach:   The approach is to develop quarantine treatments, such as low dose irradiation and hypobaric treatments, and other mitigation techniques for fresh tropical commodities and ornamental crops. Quarantine irradiation treatments will be developed for light brown apple moth, papaya mealybug, and green scale. Optimum hypobaric treatment parameters for controlling Caribbean fruit fly, Mediterranean fruit fly, oriental fruit fly, and melon fly will be determined. We will establish the tolerance of tropical fruit to any new or modified quarantine treatments, including the quality of diverse assortments of tropical fruit following irradiation treatment. To expand markets for high-value specialty fruit, we aim to develop postharvest disease control and packaging strategies to extend shelf-life. Also, preharvest practices that reduce the incidence of quarantine pests that limit exports will be investigated, such as non-chemical alternatives to control thrips on orchids, essential oil formulations for control of waxy insects on ornamental crops, and biological control of white peach scale on papayas.',\n",
       " 'Our research programs involving awake behaving nonhuman primates are based at the NIH Animal Center (NIHAC) in Poolesville, MD, approximately 90 minutes from most of the NIA laboratories in Baltimore. The NIHAC provides outstanding infrastructure for animal housing, conditioning and quarantine, servicing much of the larger NIH community. The facility is less ideally configured in support of investigator research programs, however, and given the relatively remote location of the Center, opportunities for recruiting and retaining scientific staff can be challenging. Although project start-up has been protracted as a consequence, we have recently recruited a Biologist with significant experience at the NIHAC who we anticipate will substantially facilitate progress. Key project infrastructure has also been established, including custom-designed operant chambers for computer-aided, touch screen based neuropsychological testing, and we continue to retain off-site computer programming expertise in support of this element of the project. Although accessing the outstanding in vivo brain imaging facilities on NIH main campus presents a number of logistical hurdles and administrative issues surrounding reimbursement, we are actively pursuing options for continuing and extending this component of our nonhuman primate research program. Progress from imaging we conducted elsewhere includes a recent study testing whether age-related decline in spatiotemporal and recognition memory is coupled with atrophy of memory-related brain regions in rhesus monkeys (Shamy et al., 2011). Key findings were that, in contrast to expectations derived from lesion and electrophysiological studies in young subjects, the volume of selected prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas was coupled with the status of memory that is typically considered an exemplar of medial temporal lobe function. Hippocampal volume, by comparison, predicted performance on a classic test of PFC integrity (the delayed response task). Together, the results provide novel support for the view that cognitive aging in primates arises from region-specific morphometric alterations that are distributed across multiple memory-related brain systems, prominently including subdivisions of the PFC (Shamy et al, 2011).Complementing the overall project aims, collaborative studies have also examined individual differences in the neurocognitive outcome of aging in rhesus monkeys in relation to naturally occurring ovarian hormone decline. In two recently published reports, for example, brain material from behaviorally characterized young and aged subjects was used to evaluate synaptic density and morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus by quantitative electron microscopy (Hara et al., 2010; 2011). These findings, together with observations from our related studies of surgical menopause and hormone treatment in monkeys, make the important point that the aged primate hippocampus remains sensitive to ovarian hormone status, and that the influence of reproductive senescence on circuit-specific synaptic subtypes may contribute to the effects of aging on hippocampal memory function. Progress in this area of research is surveyed in a number of recent reviews (e.g., Hara et al., 2011; Dumitriu et al., 2010).',\n",
       " \"Calcium and cyclic AMP (cAMP) are important factors in the mechanism of episodic signaling in hypothalamic GnRH neurons.  The observation that cAMP production in GT1-7 neurons is stimulated by increased  extracellular Ca 2+ , and the Ca 2+  channel agonist, BK-8644, and is diminished by low extracellular Ca 2+  and treatment with dihydropyridine analogs, is consistent with activation and/or inhibition of the calcium-dependent adenylyl cyclase type I (ACI) expressed in these cells. These findings indicate that cAMP production in GnRH neuronal cells is maintained by Ca 2+  entry through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, leading to activation of ACI, and that Ca 2+  influx-dependent activation of ACI acts in conjunction with AC-regulatory G proteins to determine basal and agonist-stimulated levels of cAMP production. Also, cAMP-induced activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNG), promotes Ca 2+  entry and caused increase in GnRH secretion. The degree of coincidence between pulses of GnRH and cAMP under basal conditions was determined by concomitant measurements of both responses in samples collected from perifused GnRH neurons.  We found that major GnRH pulses in basal GnRH release from perifused GT1-7 neurons frequently corresponded with the lowest cAMP level, indicating an inhibitory action of increased GnRH concentrations on cAMP production. Agonist activation of GnRH receptors leads to stimulation of phospholipase C, formation of IP 3 , mobilization of Ca 2+  from intracellular stores, GnRH release, and cAMP production. Modulation of GnRH receptor activity in GnRH neurons by GnRH agonist and antagonist analogs and measurements of GnRH and cAMP production were used to investigate the regulatory mechanisms underlying GnRH and cAMP pulsatile release. The GnRH agonist D-Ala 6 Ag was used to evaluate cAMPs response to GnRH-R receptor activation. Continuous exposure of perifused GT1-7 neurons to high, GnRH receptor agonist analog D-Ala 6 Ag causes an increase in GnRH pulse amplitude and transiently stimulates cAMP production followed by prolonged inhibition. This is consistent with the findings that high GnRH concentrations cause coupling of GnRH-R to G i  and inhibited cAMP production. During the treatment of perifused GT1-7 neurons with low GnRH receptor agonist concentrations the amplitude of GnRH pulses remained unchanged, with concomitant increase in cAMP pulses. These findings indicate that at low GnRH concentrations GnRH receptors couple to adenylyl cyclase stimulatory G proteins and cause an increase in cAMP production. Thus, GnRH exerts biphasic effect on cAMP production where low GnRH concentrations stimulate cAMP production and at high concentrations GnRH inhibit cAMP production. Inactivation of GnRH receptors by both peptide and non-peptide GnRH antagonists abolishes pulsatile GnRH release. The cessation of pulsatile GnRH release is dose-dependent and switches to a monotonic increase at high GnRH antagonist concentrations. Cessation of pulsatile cAMP release was also evident during GnRH antagonist treatment, and cAMP production monotonically increased with rising GnRH antagonist concentrations, suggesting that GnRH/GnRH-R mediated inhibition is required to maintain both pulsatile GnRH and cAMP secretion.  The GnRH antagonist-induced inhibition of GnRH-R, and an increase in cAMP production, may account cAMP-mediated increase in GnRH secretion.  These data suggest that pulsatile cAMP secretion in GT1-7 neurons is driven by a GnRH/GnRH-R autoregulatory system, in which dose-dependent switching of GnRH-R coupling to adenylyl cyclase stimulatory (G s ) and inhibitory (G i ) G proteins mediates both pulsatile GnRH and cAMP secretion. The lack of expression of cAMP receptors in mammalian cells, as well as GT1-7 neurons, indicates that in contrast to invertebrates, where cAMP and its receptors provide for pulsatile cAMP release, in mammalian cells the pulsatile cAMP is differently regulated.  Activation of PDE by PKA has been reported to have a role in establishing cAMP oscillations, which might constitute a biological clock for GnRH pulsatile release. Treatment of perifused GT1-7 neurons with the PKA inhibitor H-89 increased the pulse amplitude but not pulse frequency for both GnRH and cAMP.  These data suggest that under basal conditions cAMP inhibitory adenylyl cyclase V and VI are tonically activated by PKA and mediate inhibitory effects on both GnRH and cAMP secretion.  In summary, it is evident that pulsatile cAMP secretion in hypothalamic GnRH neurons is driven by a GnRH autoregulatory system in which changes in GnRH pulse amplitude cause an asynchronous relation between GnRH and cAMP pulses. The pulses synchronize after occurrence of the major GnRH pulse, providing a resetting mechanism by which GnRH and cAMP pulses may synchronize.  Inhibition of pulsatile cAMP release by PDE inhibitors did not affect pulsatile GnRH release, suggesting that cAMP does not participate in the regulatory mechanism that is essential for GnRH pulsatility.  Thus, it is evident that although cAMP is an active participant in GnRH secretion, it is not an essential component that drives pulsatile GnRH release, which is dependent on a GnRH autoregulatory system in hypothalamic GnRH neurons.  Agonist activation of the neuronal GnRH receptor stimulates the phospholipase C InsP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway, increases or inhibits cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner, and modulates the frequency and amplitude of pulsatile GnRH release.  G protein-coupled receptors also stimulate nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) by increasing intracellular calcium (Ca 2+  i ) and activating Ca 2+ -dependent nitric oxide synthetase (NOS).  However, agonist activation of GnRH receptors increases Ca 2+  i  but also causes dose-dependent inhibition of cGMP production.  Such inhibition of cGMP production was GnRH receptor-specific, and was abolished by prior treatment with a GnRH-R antagonist.  cGMP production increased in a dose-dependent manner during treatment with the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644, indicating that the mode of increased Ca 2+  i  determines its stimulatory action.  The Bay K 8644-stimulated cGMP production was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by GnRH, and treatment with the L-calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, did not potentiate the inhibitory effect of GnRH.  Basal cGMP production was not Ca 2+ -dependent and remained unchanged during treatment with nifedipine.  Treatment of GT1-7 neurons with the NO donor 3,3'-(hydroxynitrosohydrazino)bis-1-propanamine (DPTA) caused a massive increase in cGMP production that was significantly reduced by concomitant GnRH treatment.  Inhibition of cGMP production by the non-selective NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine-methylester (L-NAME), was dose-dependent and maximal inhibitory concentrations of L-NAME and GnRH were not additive, indicating NOS as a common site of action.  Pretreatment of GT1-7 neurons with pertussis toxin (PTX) significantly attenuated the GnRH-induced reduction of cGMP production.  Similarly, transfection of GT1-7 neurons with minigene vectors that produce G alpha  C-terminal inhibitory peptides suppressed the catalytic activity of PTX-sensitive G i  and G alphao  subunits, and prevented the inhibitory action of GnRH on cGMP production.  However, blockade of the catalytic activities of G alphas  and G alphaq  by expression of specific C-terminal peptides did not affect the inhibitory action of GnRH on cGMP production.  In summary, these data provide evidence that GnRH-R-activated PTX-sensitive G proteins inhibit NOS-sGC activity and reduce cGMP production in immortalized GnRH neurons.\",\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) was established in the spring of 2000 with the mission to advance research in the area of diabetes by providing novel experimental tools to the scientific community for phenotyping mouse transgenic models of diabetes and related disorders using state-of-the-art methodology that is not widely available. The goals of this program are to: 1) broaden the scope of techniques available to investigators; 2) standardize key methodologies; 3) expedite the completion of research; and 4) compile and make accessible phenotyping data to the scientific community upon its publication or two years after the completion of phenotyping services, and 5) develop novel methodology for phenotyping transgenic mice through an national administered Pilot & Feasibility Program. The cornerstone of the Yale MMPC is its two research cores, the Integrative Physiology Core and the Metabolomics Core. The Integrative Physiology Core performs glucose-insulin clamps using both radioactive and stable isotope technology to assess insulin action in liver, skeletal muscle and fat of awake mice. This core also performs hyperglycemic clamps to assess in vivo B-cell function as well as hypoglycemic clamps to assess complications relating to defective glucose counter-regulation. This core also performs 24-hour, automated, non-invasive assessment of activity, food/water consumption and energy expenditure in an environmentally controlled room. The Integrative Physiology Core also contains a Mouse Imaging Sub-Core, which performs state-of-the-art noninvasive measurements of intracellular metabolites in muscle, liver and brain of transgenic mice using MRI methods which in turn is used to assess in vivo metabolic flux through critical biochemical pathways as well as whole body measurement of fat and muscle tissue with MRI. The Metabolomics Core provides automated high throughput clinical chemistry analyses of microliter samples of mouse plasma and urine. In addition this core provides state-of-the-art GC-MS and LC/MS/MS analysis of plasma, urine and tissue samples obtained from transgenic mice. The Animal Care Core provides a centralized facility for coordinating the import, initial quarantine, screening and monitoring of mice. This Core provides stable, biocontainment housing, husbandry and health care for mice submitted to the Center and determines the microbiological profile of each imported cohort. The Administrative Core oversees the operation of the Center, coordinates the importation of all mice to Yale, performs all of the material transfer agreements, coordinates and schedules meetings and teleconferences between investigators and MMPC Core Directors, coordinates the Pilot & Feasibility Program and administers the Enrichment Program. Overall the Yale MMPC serves as a national research center that provides investigators both inside and outside Yale access to unique, state-of-the-art, standardized methods to further characterize their novel transgenic mouse models of complex metabolic diseases in a cost efficient manner.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is anticipated that the results obtained from characterizing these mice at the Yale MMPC will provide important new insights into the pathogenesis and complications relating to diabetes and obesity in humans.',\n",
       " 'This project examines how a population of  street people  are policed and otherwise regulated as they live out their days, and many of their nights, in and around the Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.  The project takes aim at theories which claim that American criminal justice institutions function either to punitively contain the destitute and disorderly elements of the poor in racialized and isolated ghettos or, failing that aim, to ?warehouse? them in jails and prisons.  This project proposes that street people are not being contained in racialized ghettos.  And far from being isolated, the study hypothesizes that while there is a police station inside the transportation center and the spaces in and around the transportation center are under constant video surveillance, the police only occasionally make arrests of street people or attempt to remove them to another area.  This is despite the fact that most of the street people who regularly spend time in Journal Square consistently engage in a range of deviant and criminal activities.  Thus, this project asks: How can this situation exist in a society in which criminal justice institutions purportedly function to criminalize and quarantine the destitute and disorderly elements of the urban poor?  Why are the police and other social control agents unwilling or unable to remove street people from the spaces in and around the transportation center or more effectively control their behavior?  How does regulation in these spaces work if not in the ways that existing theories about the governance of the urban poor suggest?  And what do the answers to these questions suggest about the nature and functions of social control in American cities today? This project aims to contribute to an understanding of how the urban poor in the United States are governed.  The findings will be relevant to a broad range of audiences, including policy makers and practitioners who develop and institute policies in this area.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Salus University, formerly the Pennsylvania College of Optometry (PCO), was originally established as a single purpose educational institution graduating eye care professionals with the Doctor of Optometry (OD) degree. PCO then expanded its horizons within health professions education, by the addition of clinical training programs in rehabilitation and audiology and, most recently adding a physician's assistant's (PA) program. Salus University has a long-standing emphasis in biomedical research, and maintains a1648 sq. ft. vivarium plus a 492 sq. ft, quarantine area in support of its biomedical research program. The following proposal is for equipment that would accomplish two major goals of the institution. These goals are to improve the quality of the environmental control of the vivarium by purchasing and installing a new HVAC system to replace the current aging system and also assure the continuity of the environmental control of the vivarium by purchasing and installing a dedicated emergency power generator of sufficient capacity to operate the HVAC and other critical husbandry and program requirements.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) seeks to purchase and install two high- efficiency cage washers for its principal vivarium, a 32,000 gross square feet multi-species facility that serves as an institutional animal resource for scientists and staff with PHS-funded independent research grants. The two cage/rack washers and one tunnel washer currently used in the vivarium are 15 years old and inefficient. The equipment is regularly under repair and, when functional, offers long cycle times. New, more modern cage washers will provide efficiency increases across many areas, including reduction in steam usage (48%), electricity (14%), hot water (78%), cold water (91%), and detergent (83%). These efficiency gains will decrease cost per load by 78% while reducing current cycle times from 26 minutes to just 9 minutes. On an annualized basis, these gains will translate to more than 1,000 kilowatts in electricity savings, over 1,000,000 fewer gallons of hot water used, and utilization of 405,000 fewer pounds of steam, all while significantly increasing throughput for this busy animal facility. The vivarium, located in the Abramson Pediatric Research Center, is the locus for CHOP's mission to advance translational research in pediatric diseases. It currently hosts pivotal research studies in sickle cell disease, hemophilia, pediatric oncology, fetal stem-cell therapy, fetal lung growth, cystic fibrosis, mitochondrial diseases, asthma, epilepsy, infectious diseases, and vaccine development. As CHOP's translational research programs continue to grow, the Hospital seeks to maintain a high-performing and environmentally sustainable infrastructure in support of the Abramson Center vivarium and the scientific goals of its research programs. The vivarium houses both large animal species (dogs, pigs, sheep, and rabbits) and CHOP's rodent quarantine facility. It provides biosafety level 2 rodent housing, isolating infectious diseases from rodents housed in CHOP's rodent barrier facility in the adjacent Colket Translational Research Building (CTRB). With 30 percent annual growth of laboratory animal- based research projects since 2006, including large animal species such as dogs and sheep, the demand for higher volume throughput from the Abramson Center's cage/rack washers has become more acute. Volume demands are compounded by the need to isolate within the vivarium the inbred, mutant, and genetically engineered mouse colonies relocated to CHOP by newly recruited investigators. These new colonies must first be rederived (creation of pathogen- free mice) prior to transfer to the CTRB barrier.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Ohio State University (OSU) requests $0.5M to renovate an existing vivarium to generate quarantine facilities on main campus for genetically engineered mice (GEM) and generate housing for transgenic zebrafish in support of the institution's entire biomedical research program. During the last fiscal year, mouse and zebrafish users at OSU have generated grants supporting over $69M in research funding. Over 75% of our current mouse and zebrafish researchers use genetically engineered models. The Rightmire Hall (RH) animal facility was built in 1990-91 and is located on the OSU West Campus one mile west of the OSU main campus. RH is located in the basement with 2,458 ft2 of space containing four animal holding rooms, rack washer, feed, bedding and clean cage storage, and a large minor procedure space. This proposal will upgrade the vivarium space, provide disposable caging systems to enhance biosecurity at the GEM quarantine and generate necessary zebrafish facilities in support of Neuroscience focused research at OSU. OSU is committed to upholding the NIH expectation that mouse resources generated with the aid of NIH funding will be distributed and shared with the scientific community in a timely manner. The majority of the mice imported into OSU are unique GEM and are not available from commercial sources. Quarantine is required for the import of GEM from non-commercial sources to avoid contamination of in house colonies. The use of new technologies has increased the efficiency of generating transgenic zebrafish lines; however, these improved approaches also require a substantial amount of space to be effective. The current zebrafish facility is shared by multiple researchers within an investigator maintained space with no expansion ability to generate the new transgenic and mutant lines required for ongoing research. The equipment requested in this proposal includes nine Inno-Vive single sided ventilated mouse racks with disposable cages and one 5-rack Aquatic Habitats system for zebrafish. Disposable caging will increase available space for animal housing; decrease personnel time and provide a green alternative consistent with OSU commitment to environmental responsibility. The requested 224 tank 5-shelf aquatic rack will accommodate an additional 10,640 fish. Two separate procedure rooms will also be generated to provide space for the genetic manipulation of zebrafish and for the colony maintenance of rodents in quarantine. By undertaking these renovations and equipment purchases, we anticipate being able to meet our goal of creating repurposing and modernizing a small aged vivarium, providing a centralized efficient rodent quarantine facility, and adding zebrafish housing space that is administratively centralized.\",\n",
       " \"Introduction Mouse models are routinely used in biomedical research as preclinical tools of investigation. For example, in the development of novel agents for the treatment of persons with hemophilia A, the hemophilia A mouse model is routinely used to demonstrate treatment proof of concept as well as investigate comparative immunogenicity. The hemophilia A mouse models, one generated by knockout of exon 16 and another by knockout of exon 17, were first developed in the laboratory of Dr. Haig Kazazian (1, 2). To date, there have been over 400 publications utilizing these animals and several biological agents in commercial development or currently marketed have been subjected to pre-clinical testing in these models. Although there are canine hemophilia models available to the biomedical research community, their numbers are extremely limited and typically these animals are only utilized for late stage preclinical testing. Therefore, the currently proposed projects only involve mouse studies. No support for large animals is requested at this time. Resources available to the Emory TRC-THD participants for the care and maintenance of mice in the proposed research are substantial. Emory University has animal facilities located in 8 buildings, on or near the main campus, including the Pediatric ECC building, where animals for this proposal will be housed and the experiments will be conducted. Additional breeding colonies are maintained in the Whitehead Building, also on the main campus. These two buildings have over 60 animal housing rooms, procedure rooms, modern animal surgeries, radiographic resources, diagnostic laboratories, and bio-containment facilities. There is an Animal Care Unit that ensures daily maintenance and routine animal care, including provision of proper housing. Sanitation and nourishment are provided based on the University's policy. This proposal will benefit from a specialized core rodent breeding services staffed by nine managers/supervisors and 42 technicians. In addition, a Veterinary Services Unit provides for the entire animal health care program. The components of this program include vendor surveillance, quarantine and isolation, preventive medicine, daily observation, treatment and intervention for injury or illness, health evaluations of sentinel animals, necropsy, histopathology, parasitology, microbiology, serology, hematology and blood chemistries. Additionally, the staff of the Laboratory Animal Medicine Unit can provide assistance with animal anesthesia, surgery, radiography and post-operative care. It is staffed by two faculty DVMs, two resident DVMs, and six veterinary technicians. Finally, Emory University is committed to providing a quality program of animal care in compliance with state and federal laws and the standards and polices of the Public Health Service. The standards of the program meet or exceed the federal Animal Welfare Act PL 89-544 (1966) and subsequent amendments and the documents entitled  Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  and  Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Emory University has been continuously accredited campus wide by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) since 1992.\",\n",
       " 'Although proteins represent the primary source of new organic nitrogen in the ocean, the identification of individual proteins and mechanisms modulating their preservation has faced analytical and computational challenges in deciphering the vast suite of possible sequences and degradation by-products.  Recent efforts to link geochemical cycling, biomedical proteomics and bioinformatics has demonstrated that only a small subset of the suite of proteins produced by marine diatoms appear to survive the degradation process, and those that do are largely protected by physical and enthalpic barriers to microbial attack. Although these discoveries help to explain the survival of individual proteins, they also generate multiple questions regarding bacteria as the dominant recyclers of organic nitrogen and carbon and needs for specific approaches to characterize modified protein products. Bacteria dominate the water column and sedimentary systems in both numbers and diversity, yet their relative contribution to the preserved proteomic pool appears low. In this project, researchers at Old Dominion Universityand the University of Washington will join forces to decipher the bacterial role in protein recycling and their potential contribution. By integrating high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics with stable isotope-based geochemical analysis, they hope to identify those bacterial proteins initially synthesized during organic matter recycling. Three research objectives drive this investigation:  (1) to determine the potential contribution of bacteria proteins to marine organic matter; (2) to identify those protein(s) synthesized by heterotrophic marine bacteria during initial stages of organic matter degradation; (3) to determine if glycan (carbohydrate) modifications represent an important component of preserved, yet unidentified, peptides seen in our analysis of oceanic particles and sediments. Broader Impacts:  This project will provide multiple opportunities for interdisciplinary student training in marine chemistry and proteomics as well as address the goal of disseminating results and tools to a broad audience. In the more traditional role, this project will expand the career for a female principal investigator in marine proteomics, support both graduate and undergraduate students at ODU which include opportunities for minority enrichment and provide training for a postdoctoral fellow at UW. On the broader level, the ODU PI participates in high school outreach programs for high achieving students in the local school which provides for summer internships and enrichment programs.',\n",
       " 'Intellectual MeritEstuaries have enormous societal importance. However, the functioning of these ecosystems is impaired by eutrophication (i.e. excess nutrient loading), which reduces water quality, causes harmful algal blooms, and increases the incidence of hypoxic events. Salt marshes act as filters of inorganic nutrients passing from the land to estuaries and ultimately to the open ocean, but coastal eutrophication may reduce the efficacy of this filtering. Furthermore, human disturbances in salt marshes are causing geomorphological change, which in turn can have cascading influences on primary producers and consumers. At the interface of saltmarshes and estuaries are tidal creeks, a potentially important link between the terrestrial ecosystem and the open estuary.Sediment microalgae and bacteria play pivotal roles in coastal carbon dynamics. Benthic microalgae can strongly influence nutrient cycling and carbon dynamics in shallow , well-lit estuaries. For instance, benthic microalgae are estimated to contribute up to 95% of total primary production in some estuarine habitats. However, few methods exist for quantifying the rate of benthic microalgal production. Carbon fixed by benthic microalgae can be rapidly assimilated by sediment bacteria. While this coupling between sediment microalgae and bacteria has been documented in multiple estuarine systems, it is largely unknown whether the importance of algal carbon to bacteria varies with nutrient availability, primary productivity, and allochthonous organic matter inputs.This project will address how rates of benthic microalgal production respond to eutrophication and geomorphological changes in human-impacted tidal creeks. Excess nutrient loading increases benthic algal biomass and likely stimulates production rates but the magnitude of nutrient and geomorphological effects on rates of production is unknown. Will changes in benthic algal productivity affect algal-bacterial coupling? Furthermore, how is algal-bacterial coupling affected by geomorphological changes, which may be exacerbated by excess nutrient loading but can also occur in pristine marshes?This project will take advantage of the infrastructure of the TIDE project, a long-term saltmarsh eutrophication experiment at the Plum Island Ecosystem - Long Term Ecological Research site in Northeastern Massachusetts. Specifically, the PIs will measure benthic metabolism and examine algal- bacterial coupling in fertilized and ambient nutrient tidal creeks in the first field season. The following field season, they will compare sediment metabolism and carbon dynamics on slumped tidal creek walls (i.e. areas where low marsh has collapsed into the tidal creek) to that on the bottom of tidal creeks. In both years, gross and net production will be determined using an innovative triple oxygen isotope technique and traditional dissolved oxygen and inorganic carbon flux measurements. Comparisons between these methods will be useful in informing studies of sediment metabolism. Lipid biomarkers will be used to characterize the sources of organic matter to creek sediments, and stable isotope analysis of bacterial specific biomarkers to identify the sources of organic carbon utilized by sediment bacteria. The biomarkers will reveal whether sediment bacteria use organic matter substrates, such as benthic microalgal carbon, selectively or in proportion to availability. Overall, results from the proposed study will provide important information about how sediment carbon dynamics in shallow tidal creeks respond to long term eutrophication. Furthermore, findings will enhance understanding of the role of tidal creeks in coastal biogeochemistry.Broader ImpactsA significant impact from this project will be better knowledge of how eutrophication - a pressing societal problem - affects biological productivity and organic matter cycling and burial. The scientists will work with local conservancy and education groups to bring an understanding of results to the public. Additionally, this project will promote education by including opportunities for two graduate students and two undergraduate students.',\n",
       " \"This doctoral dissertation research investigates how future environmental change may affect the fluvial geomorphology, or physical form, of rivers.  Environmental change, including climate variability, is acknowledged as a factor influencing river flow, particularly in mountainous watersheds, in which snowmelt makes a large contribution to annual discharge.  Potential environmental changes in the hydrology of such basins have been simulated by hydrologic models.  Most notably, these impacts include higher temperatures leading to an increase in the proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, with consequent increased winter discharge, a lower spring snowmelt peak, and decreased summer discharge.  Few of these modeling studies, however, have projected how hydrologic changes associated with climate change may affect geomorphic characteristics such as the width and depth of river channels, the shape of the river course, and the transport of sediment.  This is a gap in understanding of climate-change impacts on river systems, because river morphology responds dynamically to hydrology.  This research will contribute to better understanding of the geomorphic response of river systems to climate change through development of a hierarchical series of linked models to investigate how climate change influences hydrology, which in turn influences fluvial geomorphology.  This modeling framework will be applied to three snowmelt-dominated watersheds in the interior Pacific Northwest, with the following objectives: 1) development of downscaled basin-scale climate change scenarios, which are projections of future changes in climate variables such as temperature and precipitation that are locally specific to the study basins;  2) application of a watershed-scale hydrologic model to project how the study basins' hydrology, including the magnitude and timing of river flow, may change in response to the downscaled climate change scenarios; 3) examination of the impact of the modeled hydrologic changes on the study rivers' morphology, channel form, river shape, and sediment transport, using a reach-scale geomorphic model that can simulate an individual river segment in greater detail than a watershed model; and 4) quantification of past rates of change in river shape using historic aerial photos to compare with the geomorphic modeling results.  This hierarchical modeling process is an innovative approach to linking physical processes that occur across multiple scales, from global and regional climate to watershed hydrology to local geomorphology.The results of this research will have implications for the management of river systems.  Geomorphic processes significantly affect the value of rivers, including their suitability for threatened and endangered species and for human uses of water.  Knowledge of how climate change may affect these processes will allow water resource managers to make more informed decisions about how to respond to future changes.  The results will be disseminated at national scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\",\n",
       " 'Determining the conditions for the outbreak, spread, and extinction of an infectious disease is an important public health problem. Global eradication of an infectious disease has rarely been achieved, but it continues to be a public health goal for many diseases. More commonly, one can observe local disease extinction, or fade out, followed by a reintroduction of the disease from other regions through a migratory effect. In general, extinction occurs in populations undergoing stochastic effects owing to random transitions. The origins of stochasticity may be internal to the system or may arise from the external environment. Small population size, low contact frequency for frequency-dependent transmission, competition for resources and evolutionary pressure, as well as heterogeneity in populations and transmission, may all be determining factors for extinction to occur. The possibility of an extinction event is affected by the nature and strength of the stochastic noise, as well as other factors, including outbreak amplitude and seasonal phase occurrence. For large populations, the intensity of internal population noise is generally small. However, a rare, large fluctuation can occur with non-zero probability and the system may be able to reach the extinct state. The research objective is to study the dynamics of disease spread and extinction using stochastic metapopulation models that consist of coupled regions or patches.  A master equation formalism will be used to understand the disease dynamics and to find the path that maximizes the probability of disease extinction. The  results will enable one to speed up disease extinction through the use of control methods including vaccination and quarantine programs.  The proposal is highly multidisciplinary, and involves dynamical systems, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, and control theory. The mathematical tools that will be developed will provide new ways of analyzing and confirming numerical results. In addition, the analysis will lead to the prediction of novel information and system behavior, and will provide for improved understanding of infectious disease outbreak, spread, and extinction processes. In particular, this new understanding of disease dynamics will enable the development of optimal control methods to lessen disease outbreak and spread. The proposal includes carefully planned projects that will involve and support undergraduate and graduate students in leading-edge research. Significantly, the student population at Montclair State University, and in particular, the Department of Mathematical Sciences, includes a substantial proportion who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines (including women and minorities) and the research program will leverage existing programs directed to these students. The outcome of the research will be disseminated through seminars, presentations at meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) was established in the spring of 2000 with the mission to advance research in the area of diabetes by providing novel experimental tools to the scientific community for phenotyping mouse transgenic models of diabetes and related disorders using state-of-the-art methodology that is not widely available. The goals of this program are to: 1) broaden the scope of techniques available to investigators; 2) standardize key methodologies; 3) expedite the completion of research; and 4) compile and make accessible phenotyping data to the scientific community upon its publication or two years after the completion of phenotyping services, and 5) develop novel methodology for phenotyping transgenic mice through an national administered Pilot & Feasibility Program. The cornerstone of the Yale MMPC is its two research cores, the Integrative Physiology Core and the Metabolomics Core. The Integrative Physiology Core performs glucose-insulin clamps using both radioactive and stable isotope technology to assess insulin action in liver, skeletal muscle and fat of awake mice. This core also performs hyperglycemic clamps to assess in vivo B-cell function as well as hypoglycemic clamps to assess complications relating to defective glucose counter-regulation. This core also performs 24-hour, automated, non-invasive assessment of activity, food/water consumption and energy expenditure in an environmentally controlled room. The Integrative Physiology Core also contains a Mouse Imaging Sub-Core, which performs state-of-the-art noninvasive measurements of intracellular metabolites in muscle, liver and brain of transgenic mice using MRI methods which in turn is used to assess in vivo metabolic flux through critical biochemical pathways as well as whole body measurement of fat and muscle tissue with MRI. The Metabolomics Core provides automated high throughput clinical chemistry analyses of microliter samples of mouse plasma and urine. In addition this core provides state-of-the-art GC-MS and LC/MS/MS analysis of plasma, urine and tissue samples obtained from transgenic mice. The Animal Care Core provides a centralized facility for coordinating the import, initial quarantine, screening and monitoring of mice. This Core provides stable, biocontainment housing, husbandry and health care for mice submitted to the Center and determines the microbiological profile of each imported cohort. The Administrative Core oversees the operation of the Center, coordinates the importation of all mice to Yale, performs all of the material transfer agreements, coordinates and schedules meetings and teleconferences between investigators and MMPC Core Directors, coordinates the Pilot & Feasibility Program and administers the Enrichment Program. Overall the Yale MMPC serves as a national research center that provides investigators both inside and outside Yale access to unique, state-of-the-art, standardized methods to further characterize their novel transgenic mouse models of complex metabolic diseases in a cost efficient manner.',\n",

       " 'This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant provides funding for the development of a numerical framework to model solvent-based fabrication of thin film organic solar cells. The developed numerical tools will track the evolution of the thin-film morphology (i.e. material distribution) as a function of processing conditions (evaporation rate, spinning speed, annealing time) and configuration (blend-ratio, solvent type and substrate). An adaptive time-stepping strategy along with domain-decomposition and associated parallel computing tools will be used to solve this multiscale, multiphysics problem. A computational tool, based on ideas from graph theory, will be developed to rapidly classify and characterize the predicted morphologies. The numerical predictions will be validated using available microscopy and x-ray diffraction experiments. High throughput simulations will be performed to quantify and understand the effects of solvents, substrate patterning and evaporation conditions on morphology evolution and device performance.If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the performance of organic photovoltaic devices. The quantitative analysis of morphology evolution during fabrication will accelerate the design process by delivering the ability to directly predict and interpret time-varying three-dimensional snapshots of intermediate morphologies. The high throughput fabrication process-morphology analysis will provide valuable insights toward synthesis and design. The research involves formulating and solving several algorithmic and computing problems, which provide contributions to applied math and computer science in their own right. The proposed work will also educate the next generation of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) students and the predominantly experimental organic solar cell community about integrating computational thinking with experimental analysis in renewable energy research through education modules, short courses, and open source software.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem in the United States. Although medical therapy can improve outcomes, data suggest that proven therapies continue to be underutilized. Current guidelines suggest that treatment be titrated toward the target doses used in clinical trials, but  clinical inertia  often represents a barrier to aggressive titration of medical therap for both providers and patients. There is a pressing need to develop strategies to improve the utilization of proven therapies for chronic HF in order to improve outcomes. The natriuretic peptides are biomarkers of hemodynamic stress that provide important prognostic information in HF. Changes in natriuretic peptide levels over time are strongly associated with outcomes, and HF therapies proven to have beneficial effects outcomes decrease natriuretic peptide levels over time. These data suggest that serial measurements of natriuretic peptides may serve as a guide to the titration of medical therapy in HF -  biomarker guided therapy.  Although small studies meta-analyses have suggested a decrease in mortality with this approach, there remains an unmet need for a robustly powered study to determine whether biomarker guided therapy improves outcomes in chronic HF. We propose to address this unmet need with the GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE-IT) Study, a randomized clinical trial of biomarker guided therapy in HF. The primary aim of GUIDE-IT is to compare a strategy of medical therapy titrated to a natriuretic peptide target to usual care in 1100 high risk patients with HF. Our primary hypothesis is that biomarker guided therapy will reduce the composite endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first HF hospitalization by 20% compared to usual care over a follow up period of at least 12 months. This application includes a Clinical Coordinating Center, a Data Coordinating Center, and an Economics-Quality of Life core lab. GUIDE-IT will test an innovative model of HF management-the individualized titration of medical therapy to a physiologic target rather than a  one size fits all  approach. Results of GUIDE-IT will be guideline changing and have immediate clinical implications for the management of millions of Americans living with chronic HF.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE-IT) Study is a clinical trial testing adjustment of heart failure (HF) therapy based on natriuretic peptides vs. usual care in high risk patients with HF. GUIDE-IT will test an innovative model of HF management using the individualized titration of therapy to a biologic target, which will have immediate clinical implications for millions of patients with HF.

       " \"Microbes regulate many important ecological processes such as nitrogen cycling in wetland ecosystems.   A major area of uncertainty is whether the composition of the microbial community is an important determinant of the rates at which nitrogen is processed, or if these rates are independent of which microbial taxa happen to present.  This doctoral dissertation improvement research project will address this knowledge gap while simultaneously examining potential climate change impacts on nitrogen biogeochemistry. Specifically, the intrusion of saltwater into historically freshwater wetlands, an anticipated consequence of sea level rise, is expected to alter microbially-mediated nitrogen cycling processes including denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). A reciprocal transplant experiment that moves soil microbial communities between saltwater and freshwater wetlands will be used to determine the importance of environmental conditions, especially salinity, on DNF and DNRA activity rates.  Further, by using soil cores that are both open and closed to migration from the host environment this work will explicitly test what role community composition plays in determining these biogeochemical rates.  Developing an understanding of the relationship between microbial community composition and rates of ecosystem processes is important for understanding the impacts of climate change, land use change, and other factors influencing ecosystems worldwide. The findings will also be useful in enhancing environmental engineering efforts to mitigate nitrogen pollution.  Undergraduates from Virginia Commonwealth University's exceptionally diverse student body will be involved in all aspects of this research, and results will be brought directly into an existing course in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.\",\n",
       " 'Modern molecular techniques have greatly increased our ability to identify bacteria. This has made it possible to investigate what controls the distribution of microbes and the composition of microbial communities, and to address fundamental questions about the roles that microbes play in essential ecological processes. Although current research is contributing to the recognition of geographic distribution patterns of microorganisms, the application of well-developed macroecological theory may provide insight to mechanisms underlying these patterns.  The influence of resource availability on soil bacterial communities will be examined within the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. This region contains environmental gradients of nutrients, water, and salts which are predicted to strongly influence these simple, bacteria-dominated communities. Soil samples from 12 sites representing a natural gradient in above-ground production by moss and algae were collected in December 2010. DNA-based fingerprinting techniques applied to those samples revealed variation in bacterial community structure. Six of these soils will be resampled in 2012 and sequenced using both DNA- and RNA-based techniques to assess how bacterial community composition and metabolic activity are affected by resource availability. In addition, soil moisture and organic matter content will be experimentally manipulated to examine their interactive effects in structuring soil bacterial communities and their influence on microbial activity. This project will contribute to a greater understanding of mechanisms structuring bacterial communities and how this, in turn, may influence rates of ecosystem processes mediated by soil microorganisms. RNA-based methods also represent a novel approach for determining the active diversity of bacteria, a technique with potential value for investigating bacterial communities in all soils where a large proportion of the microbial community may be inactive.  This research will impact a broader audience by engaging undergraduate students in primary research and through interaction with both GK-12 outreach and an Antarctic study abroad programs currently operating at Virginia Tech.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Primate Resource Referral Service (PRRS) provides the communications/database network needed for efficient acquisition and sharing of existing captive primates and primate-related resources by investigators and institutions both nationally and internationally. The overarching goal of this service is to maximize the use of existing captive primates thereby reducing the total number of primates needed for research, and in turn, helping to promote the conservation of primate populations in the wild. The PRRS will maintain information on four major primate-related resource listings including, Primates, Biomaterials, Equipment, and Outreach. The PRRS's related services will continue to include: 1) Referral Service, an immediate, staff-operated service designed to match investigator inquiries/requests to the available resource listings maintained in the PRRS master database; 2) Interactive Website, an interactive, internet-based site that includes online forms for posting resource availability & requests, updates or changes to listings, an online renewal form, the full text of CURRENT LISTINGS, the current ARG, an online feedback form, general service information, and links to other sites of interest to the primate research community; 3) CURRENT LISTINGS, a twice monthly newsletter listing current availability of, as well as requests for, primates, tissues, equipment, and related services; and 4) ANNUAL RESOURCE GUIDE (ARG), an annual publication that lists subscribing suppliers of primates, laboratories, equipment, and commercial services such as transportation and quarantine facilities. The PRRS also will establish an active educational outreach program for the local schools (K-12) to help educate children about the significant achievements in biomedical research and the translational value of the work. The research component of the proposed project will assess ongoing primate requests and availability so as to help track and predict emerging trends in species use and demand. The PRRS will continue to serve the NCRR community, research institutions, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, zoological parks, and breeding colonies. This service will facilitate the efficient sharing of captive primates and primate-related resources, resulting in significant cost savings to the research community and a reduction in the time and effort required by investigators to locate or place animals and tissues. The PRRS has provided the primate research community with a unique service for the past 33 years, and will continue to do in support of one of NCRR's most important objectives - to expand and ensure the development of and access to animal models (2009-2013 NCRR Strategic Plan).\",\n",
       " 'Human activities have dramatically increased nitrogen inputs into many rivers and lakes, causing algal blooms that threaten economic and recreational uses of those waters. Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in China, experiences damaging blooms of toxic cyanobacteria as a result of excessive nutrient inputs. The identities, nitrogen processing capabilities, and activities of microbial communities in Lake Taihu will be examined to determine if nitrogen processing can be predicted from knowledge of the identity and genetic makeup of those communities. Various components of the nitrogen cycle will be measured and linked to representative molecular markers which, coupled with high throughput genetic sequencing, will provide a genetic database of nitrogen-cycling processes in freshwater ecosystems. A goal of the project will be to link microbial taxonomic, genetic, and functional data in a model that can predict how reduction of nutrient inputs will affect toxic cyanobacterial blooms.This project will have broad applicability to the management of aquatic systems that are threatened by excessive nutrient inputs, a problem that is increasing worldwide. Additional broader impacts will include training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, international student exchanges, training of a postdoctoral researcher, and incorporation of science journalism students into field studies to promote adult scientific literacy.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of our proposal is to enhance the nation's public health response capability by quantifying agent-based model uncertainty and the impact of behavioral modification on the spread of infectious diseases. Our goal is to improve the understanding of the impact of emergent behavior on the accuracy and applicability of predictive models of disease spread. We will evaluate the implications of uncertainty in human and population behavioral response to a pandemic in mathematical model formulations. This foundational understanding will help improve all existing epidemiological models thereby potentiating the ability of public health practitioners and policy-makers to effectively manage a burgeoning epidemic regardless of the tool being used. We will leverage existing epidemiologic and behavioral simulation infrastructure to develop new mathematical approaches to incorporate different types of diseases and behavioral changes alone and in combination with other intervention strategies. We will validate the models and quantify sensitivity of computational models to parameters, and known disease spread patterns. These models will be constructed for use in estimating prevalence and incidence and will allow us to compare systematically the relative effects of preventive measures, such as behavioral changes, isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination. First, we will develop novel approaches to characterize emergent behavior and extend the mathematical foundation and software infrastructure for modeling behavior changes in response to an epidemic. Secondly, we will quantify the epidemic progression uncertainty caused by the distribution of behavioral responses. These behavioral models will be implemented and validated in an existing high-fidelity agent-based activity simulator model. Finally, we will disseminate these advances so they can be useful, and used, in other epidemiological simulations.  RELEVANCE: The data for an ongoing epidemic is sparse, inexact, and often just unavailable. Therefore, quantifying parameter and computational uncertainties is crucial for forecasting the impact of disease spread. We cannot assume impact of the uncertain parameters is negligible; especially when decisions based on the model will impact the lives of countless people. One of the fundamental limitations of the current models is in how well they capture changes in human behavior in response to an ongoing endemic.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular evolution of primate DNA double-strand break repair genes will be studied. These genes are important for genome stability, and many cancer syndromes have been linked to mutations in these genes. Interestingly, many members of this gene family bear signatures of recurrent positive selection. The hypothesis being tested is that these signatures result from the long-term co-evolution between these DNA repair genes and the pervasive, parasitic retroviruses and retrotransposons with which primates have evolved. This may have influenced primate DNA repair genes with respect to both polymorphic and fixed genetic variation. In this proposed research, large primate sequence datasets will be generated for genes involved in human double-strand break repair, and these will be tested for signatures of recurrent positive selection. Retroviral infection assays will then be used to test whether adaptive sequence change in these DNA repair genes has resulted in altered susceptibility to infection. The consequences of this sequence change to cellular DNA repair will also be explored. Preliminary data in a cell culture model system shows that one of the most well-known cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, may be evolving under the dual selective pressures of DNA repair fidelity and retroviral resistance. Based on this, DNA repair gene evolution can have a profound effect on cancer, and for this reason, it is of great importance that the evolutionary forces that define the evolution of these genes be elucidated. This proposed research is central to the overarching goal of understanding how genetic parasites, through the selective pressures that they exert, shape the sequence of human genes with which they interact.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human cells contain a complex network of DNA repair pathways, which have evolved to protect the integrity of chromosomes. However, the evolution and function of DNA repair proteins may be influenced by retroviral pathogens, like HIV, which use these proteins for their own benefit. Understanding the evolution of DNA repair genes is important to understanding both the formation of cancers and susceptibility to retroviral infection.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All linear double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses package their genome into a preformed procapsid via an ATP-driving motor. The central component of the phi29 DNA-packaging motor is the portal connector composed of twelve copies of the protein gp10, which form a dodecamer channel that acts as a pathway for the translocation of dsDNA. With a diameter of 3.6 nm at its narrowest end, it is one of the largest among typical channel proteins that have been incorporated into lipid membranes. Explicit engineering and pore modifications of the phi29 connector are possible due to its available crystal structure, thus inspiring the use of such a system as a module in biomedical applications or nanodevices. The short-term objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the utility of the lipid-embedded channel of the phi29 DNA packaging motor as a highly sensitive device for capture and fingerprinting of chemicals and biopolymers in real time at single molecule resolution using electrophysiological assays. The connector will be reengineered for added functionality and various approaches will be undertaken to modulate the dimensions of the pore. Alteration of the charge distributions will be made by mutagenesis in a controlled fashion to ensure optimal sensing. The channel will be designed to act as a stochastic biosensor and functionalized with recognition groups to bind various analytes of interest. Methods to increase the stability and lifetime of the lipid/connector complex will be developed to facilitate high throughput electrophysiological measurement of a single pore with provisions for rapid and efficient sample and buffer exchange. The long-term objective is to develop the channel into a robust sensing device for detecting biomolecules or chemicals at extremely low concentrations in the presence of many contaminants for a wide range of applications in biotechnology, earlier disease diagnosis, environmental surveillance, custom quarantine, drug testing and national security.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The membrane embedded nanopore of bacteriophage phi29 biomotor will be reengineered, characterized and developed into a single pore sensor for detection of biomolecules and chemicals. The combination of capture and fingerprinting with multiple identification parameters for single molecule detection in real time will make the system highly sensitive to detect molecules at extremely low concentrations in the presence of many contaminants.',\n",

       " \"Legumes contribute 1/3 of humankind's protein intake, a fact that is directly related to their unusual capacity to access atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Biological nitrogen fixation also makes legumes key components of both natural and agricultural systems because they return vital nitrogen to the environment. This project will extend existing knowledge of how legumes and their symbiotic bacteria establish this unique partnership, in particular by bridging traditional genetic methodologies with specialized tools that the investigators have developed for protein biochemistry and cell biology. The outcome of these studies will be increased understanding of a critical phase in symbiotic development, namely the period during which legumes select efficient symbiotic bacteria from the soil environment. In particular, the proposed research will identify new genes and proteins that underlie symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Knowledge of symbiotic nitrogen fixation has great relevance to agricultural systems, because US agricultural is highly dependent on input nitrogen, which for non-legumes involves consumption of fossil fuels to drive conversion at atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to fertilizer nitrogen. The fact that legumes produce fertilizer nitrogen directly, using solar energy obtained through photosynthesis, makes them key components of cost-effective, carbon-neutral, sustainable agricultural systems. Increased understanding of symbiotic development will enhance our ability to constructively manipulate this vital biological process.

       " \"The use of methyl bromide (MeBr) fumigation for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes (QPS) continues to rise with the expansion of world trade and increasing globalization. The U.S. wood products industry will continue to request critical use exemptions for MeBr of solid wood packaging materials and other wood commodities as long as acceptable alternative treatments are unavailable, ineffective, or cost prohibitive. MeBr use in the U.S. will not decline considerably until we address QPS uses. Prior research by this team has led to formal submission and tentative approval of dielectric heating as the first alternative to methyl bromide fumigation under International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM-15) by the International Plant Protection Convention, Commission on Phytosanitary Measures (CPM). ISPM-15 stipulates that wood used to ship products between countries must be debarked, heat treated to 56C at the core for 30 minutes or fumigated with MeBr, and stamped or branded with a mark of compliance. ISPM-15 affects all wood packaging material and its purpose is to prevent the international transport and spread of pests that could negatively affect plants and ecosystems in the introduced region. The goal of this project is to facilitate final approval of dielectric heating technology by the CPM for treating SWPM and associated wood products, which will also provide useful data that can be modified and adopted for other CUN's related to food and food packaging. This will be done through modeling internal wood temperatures as a function of surface temperature measured using infrared technology using bulk treatment of wood under different conditions to simulate operational conditions. This information will be used to develop a recommended approach for implementing dielectric heating in commercial settings. A cost/benefit economic analysis will be performed comparing dielectric heating to methyl bromide and conventional kiln treatment to provide the necessary evidence to the industry that dielectric is cost effective. Significant outreach/extension activities are planned to educate and promote this technology to the industry. This project will thus develop and deliver the knowledge base necessary to promote adoption of this technology by the wood packaging industry, leading to a dramatic reduction in the use MeBr for phytosanitary treatment for quarantine pre-shipment purposes.\",\n",
       " 'The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) has emerged recently as a major threat to citrus in the Western U.S. This invasive insect, which is a vector of the pathogen that causes Huanglongbing disease, is largely an urban problem in Southern California. Management efforts in the region consist of insecticide application in residential settings, production nursery treatments prior to plant shipment to retail nurseries, and quarantine to limit the spread of infested plant material. However, psyllid populations continue to increase in certain areas. Increasingly, homeowners and landscapers will be responsible for managing their own citrus trees to limit damages, and retail nurseries must take a more active role in psyllid control to ensure D. citri and the pathogen, should it arrive, are not disseminated to other parts of the state. Therefore, mitigating the potential impact of D. citri and Huanglongbing in California hinges on the development of a robust educational outreach program in these urban areas. We will develop a monitoring and extension program that targets urban infestations of Diaphorina citri to refine existing control measures. This will include monitoring and extension activities for residential settings to ensure widespread adoption of sound management practices. We will also conduct monitoring and extension activities for retail nursery employees to limit the role these businesses play in inadvertently facilitating vector or pathogen spread. This work will enhance IPM of D. citri and constrain its spread in California, potentially delaying or at least ameliorating some of the impact of Huanglongbing establishment.',\n",

       " 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), one of the slowest growing mycobacteria, is the etiologic agent of paratuberculosis (Johne?s disease, JD), in ruminants. JD has a significant economic impact and worldwide distribution. JD has lower prevalence in beef herds but still has a negative impact on trade. MAP has the potential to be a zoonotic and/or food-borne pathogen, as evidenced by its possible linkage to Crohn?s disease. Other pathogenic mycobacteria include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of human tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium bovis that causes bovine tuberculosis, a zoonotic disease transmissible from ruminants and wildlife to human hosts. Bovine tuberculosis is classified as a category I Program disease requiring immediate reporting. Though M. bovis infections are rare, they could become major concerns for trade requiring quarantine and onerous expenses for containment. Our work is directed at the generation of vaccines, identification of new drug targets, and development of new drugs to control and treat mycobacterioses. Our major interest will focus on the veterinary pathogen MAP. We have pioneered the molecular technologies used to manipulate MAP and have most molecular procedures in place. Moreover, recently established collaborations will allow us to implement cutting edge technologies and obtain complementary expertise in immunology, chemistry, and biochemistry. We have also the necessary institutional facilities to work with the BSL3 pathogen M. tuberculosis. Technical problems may still arise, but we are confident these will be readily overcome. Furthermore, a solid conceptual foundation has been developed for the experimental objectives proposed. Thus, we expect their outcomes will lead to novel findings. In MAP research, we expect that, in conjunction with industry, our attenuated strains will be further developed into a marketed vaccine product to control JD. We also expect to develop new diagnostic tests to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. Our research on metabolic pathways is directed to the identification of new drug targets against tuberculosis. The established collaborations are expected to lead to the development of actual candidate drugs.',\n",
       " 'Understanding the effects of common carp on food webs has far reaching management implications. Recent research has revealed that benthic production may be the primary energy source in lakes and support a large proportion of fish production. This may be particularly true in shallow lakes and in more pristine systems with minimal disturbance. Understanding these energy sources is vital because benthic productivity tends to support a greater biomass of consumers and is more efficiently transferred than pelagic productivity. Perturbations may alter linkages between benthic and pelagic energy pathways and organismal use of these energy sources. The strength and nature of benthic-pelagic food web linkages may determine in part how perturbations affect whole ecosystems, but these linkages are poorly understood making it difficult to predict the actual effects of perturbation. By increasing algal and suspended sediment turbidity and reducing benthic invertebrate prey resources, carp may limit benthic productivity, altering production of higher level consumers relying on these resources. Carp tend to increase or promote eutrophication of shallow lakes and there is a general trend of benthic to pelagic domination of production along the eutrophication gradient. These shifts in the relative contributions of benthic and pelagic primary productivity also correspond to clear to turbid water shifts in shallow lakes, where benthic production is of more importance in the clear-water stable state and pelagic production dominates in the turbid-water state. Because many fishes rely heavily on benthic prey resources, reductions in benthic prey resources and shifts in primary production from benthic to pelagic resources may have pronounced effects on aquatic food webs and sustainable production of sport fishes. This proposed study seeks to quantify the influences that common carp have on sport fish communities by investigating their effects on population dynamics and food webs.',\n",
       " 'Zoonotic pathogens - those that are shared by animals and humans - comprise over 75% of all emerging human diseases. Tick-borne pathogens comprise a significant and growing sector. Tick-borne pathogens are maintained by various species of wildlife and different wildlife community compositions can sculpt different human disease risk. In Texas, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia pathogens are present within ticks that bite humans. These include the agent of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The incidence of all three has increased over the 1990-2009 period. In addition, tick-borne pathogens that cause disease in domesticated animals are of continued concern. Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina are the agents of bovine babesiosis and are transmitted by cattle fever ticks. In Texas, active management of a fever tick quarantine buffer zone is aimed at preventing the reintroduction of fever ticks to the United States. The roles that free-ranging and captive wildlife and exotic species in Texas play in the maintenance of Babesia parasites and in hosting Fever ticks require further attention. A prerequisite for effective disease prevention is to understand the ecology of natural cycles of pathogen transmission. One large component of the natural cycle is the identification of key vertebrate hosts that feed ticks, which allow tick populations to thrive and may also serve as pathogen reservoirs. Blood meal analysis is a tool used to identify the hosts of blood feeding arthropods. Here, we propose the development of a novel approach to study North American tick-host interactions based on stable isotopes in host blood that are retained in the tick. This approach will elucidate key features of enzootic pathogen maintenance that can be targeted in disease control strategies, thereby reducing human and animal disease risk. Given the emergence of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens and the threat of resurgence of important tick-borne livestock disease in Texas, local information on the ecology of enzootic pathogen maintenance, including tick-host interactions, is critical for understanding and reducing disease risk. Identifying host interactions of ticks has unique challenges because ticks have long periods between blood meals, during which time, signals from the host blood degrade. Therefore, a novel approach is needed for understanding tick-host interactions as a complementary tool to existing approaches, and we propose to exploit the natural variation in the abundance of stable isotopes. We expect to develop a template based on the variation in stable isotope signatures in different host species. This template can be used to identify vector-host interactions, with applications for understanding and managing tick-borne diseases. Benefits of our proposed system identifying tick-host interactions using stable isotopes include that this technique is not specific to any disease system and will have applications for providing knowledge to control many tick-borne diseases. This research is expected to result in peer-reviewed publications as well as presented at various national scientific conferences.',\n",
       " 'As a service to NHGRI investigators, the Transgenic Core specializes in generating genetically altered mouse lines for basic studies of gene function and regulation and for the creation of mouse models of human genetic diseases. Three separate technologies are utilized by the Core to generate genetically altered mice. The first method is to create conventional transgenics by microinjection of DNA into fertilized embryos (pronuclear microinjection) to generate germline mice. Secondly, targeted transgenics are generated by microinjecting genetically altered embryonic stem cells (ES cells). The ES cells are modified via homologous recombination of targeted genes in the Core or, are imported ES cell lines from other institutions (i.e., IKMC) Imported lines require expansion and archiving, DNA/RNA analysis, karyotyping, and MAP/Mycoplasma testing. ES cells are then injected into 2.5 day 8-cell embryos or 3.5 day blastocysts to generate fully ES cell-derived or chimeric mice, respectively. The Core generates transgenic mice by aggregation of tetraploid embryos with hybrid ES cells. By using 8-cell or tetraploid aggregation embryos to produce heterozygous or fully ES cell derived mice, the time and number of animals required is reduced for breeding chimeras. Third, the Core supports a genome-wide approach to discover and study new genes by ENU mutagenesis. Mutagenized mice are bred to assess stability of phenotype and heritability and then transferred to the investigator.  The Core archives, in multiple locations, mutant strains by cryopreservation of sperm and embryos and reconstitutes the lines by in vitro fertilization. Thus, the Core can rapidly re-establish mouse strains in the event of a disaster or outbreak as well as easily export lines more efficiently and humanely to other institutions. For quality control, the Core cryopreserves stock embryos from wild-type strains (C57Bl/6J, FVB/N, 129S6Sv/Ev and Balb/c). These embryos are also used for flexible microinjection of 8-cell embryos. The use of cryopreserved embryos reduces animal donor needs by 50-60% and allows microinjection of 2-3x more embryos per session. An additional service provided to our institute is to rederive animals into our facility by embryo transfer of fertilized eggs. Rederivation generally takes 7-8 weeks as compared to 14-16 weeks for conventional quarantine methods. Closely associated to our rederivation and cryopreservation program, is the in-house breeding colony. This colony rapidly generates mice for experiments and centralizes animals used across animal protocols (ie. cre transgenics). We perform PCR-based genotyping, breed on multiple backgrounds (129 and C57Bl/6) and cryopreserve the lines. We can readily reconstitute mice, which enables reduced rack space for maintenance breeding. Other services include embryo dissection, mouse perfusions, injections, colony maintenance, and animal identification by genotyping. The Core works with NHGRI investigators in construct design, and in basic manipulations of mouse husbandry. The Core is committed to cutting edge transgenic technologies while finding better avenues to reduce the animal requirements. For example, we are investigating inhibitors to improve ES cell quality and improved chimeras. By using inhibitors of GSK3b and MAPK, our parental cell lines and targeted lines have better morphology, controlled growth rate, and higher Nanog levels. This should improve both in-house, and the multiple imported ES cells. The Core is also standardizing protocols for creating induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells from mutant mice. We are using dox-inducible lentiviruses containing the inductive factors and mRNA reprogramming. Our objectives are to generate iPS cells from transgenic mouse embryonic feeder cells (MEFS) or tail tip fibroblasts (TTF), characterize them by immunocytochemistry, real-time PCR and generate chimeras from these ES-like cells and breed to germline transmission. We prepare MEFS or tail tip fibroblasts and make them available to our investigators who require them for human ES and iPS studies. Moreover, we support characterization of human iPS lines by assisting in the cell injection and generation of teratomas in nude mice. Core Personnel Description and Equipment Capabilities:The Transgenic Core has seven full-time employees. Lisa Garrett directs and oversees daily operations, training and experimental design. The core staff includes six staff, employed directly by the core, through a branch, or by contract. They include Jun Cheng, Gene Elliott, Kowser Hasneen, Karen Hazzard (all technical staff) and Cecilia Rivas and Elsa Escobar (animal support contractors).  The physical organization of the Core is divided into two laboratories behind the animal barrier. The third floor lab houses the central tissue culture space for ES cell growth and maintenance, a cryopreservation area, a microinjection suite with three Zeiss/Eppendorf  microinjection stations and one Nikon micromanipulation station, a molecular biology area, and administrative space for 5 individuals. The second floor laboratory is for animal use with downdraft tables and biosafety cabinets. We have a dedicated area for harvesting embryos and tissues with 4 stereomicroscopes that are available to institute investigators. This lab contains a chemical fume hood for ENU, a small animal surgery suite with 3 stereomicroscopes and downdraft tables, a tissue culture area for iPS generation, and ES cell differentiation.  There is administrative space for 2 individuals.Summary August 2011- August 2012 The Core generated conventional transgenics from 18 DNA constructs since August 2011. We have 43 ES cell - targeting constructs that are in various stages of development such as screening for homologous recombination, microinjection, and generation of germline transmitting progeny. I anticipate greater than 25 conventional transgenic constructs for the upcoming year and at least 35 targeting constructs for our institute.During the past year, we rederived in 33 lines of imported mice, cryopreserved 47 lines for disaster and archived 63 mouse lines. For the upcoming year , we will continue to cryopreserve all mutant mice imported or generated by the Core. I have modified our freezing program to reduce the numbers of embryos frozen ( therefore reducing the numbers of mice) and balance the archiving with cryopreserved sperm. We have a significant increase in efficiency of recovering frozen sperm by IVF (>50%) using a modified method by Nakagata et al., J.Mamm.Ova Res. 2010. The ENU mutagenesis project has been successful with 12 mutants identified from the screening of 776 male G1 progeny. From the inception of the ENU program, approximately 1,253 G1 male progeny have been produced. The present objective for this screen is to continue generating mutagenized G1 males that will be bred to sensitized animals for neural crest phenotypes until the gene pool has been saturated and redundant mutations appear. From reviewing Pubmed and information from our investigators, the Core has made substantial contributions on >120 papers from 2005-present. This includes both co-authorship and acknowledgements of several members of the Core. This compilation of papers represents any resource or mouse generated by the Core. Since January 2011, the Core has had co-authorship on at least 5 publications.',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): 1. Identify and describe invasive and emerging plant pathogens, including rust and smut pathogens of quarantine significance; canker and anthracnose pathogens of tree, forage, and oil crops; and fungi associated with potential biofuel crops. 2. Develop robust phylogenetic classification systems for plant-associated fungi to better predict pathogen behavior and to enable development of accurate diagnostic methods for closely related or morphologically similar species. 3. Develop and validate molecular identification and genotyping resources for insect biocontrol fungi Beauveria spp. and Metarhizium.  Approach: Fungi in these groups will be collected, cultured and characterized microscopically to screen for taxa of interest and provide provisional identifications. For smut and bunt fungi, initial focus will be on species of Tilletia closely related to dwarf bunt, T. controversa. Species of Ustilago including segregate genera and Urocystis (flag smut) will also be collected and characterized as encountered. Species of Phomopsis and related canker pathogens in the Gnomoniaceae will be the major focus among the canker fungi as well as Neonectria and related nectriaceous fungi. Rust and anthracnose fungi (primarily Colletotrichum) associated with sugarcane, switchgrass, and turf grasses will also be collected and characterized.  Fungi useful for controlling plant pests, including Beauveria and Metarhizium, will be characterized using novel markers developed from available genome data. PCR will be performed to amplify ribosomal and protein-coding genes, including ITS, LSU, EF1-alpha, and RNA polymerase gene regions. For determining initial identities and superficial relationships of newly obtained taxa, the ITS regions of the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit will be sequenced, compared with existing data in GenBank, and correlated with morphological data. For determining species relationships across these genera and relationships of genera, the ITS, LSU, tef1-a, ß-tub, and rpb gene regions will be analyzed along with other genes to be determined including the single copy DNA lyase Apn2, Mat1M72F/R for the combined Mat1, intergenic region and 5’ Apn2, and the single copy SOD2 gene. Whole genome DNA sequencing from Colletotrichum isolates will be performed using short read next generation sequencing technology from genomic DNA. Population-level and phylogenomic relationships of anthracnose pathogens of grasses will be determined. Population genetic analyses combining microsatellite, mating type, and SNP data will be used to analyze the genetic structure of Beauveria populations in areas where it has been applied to control plant pests. For population scale analyses, genotypic data will be combined into multilocus haplotypes for each isolate and used to perform population genetic analyses. Coalescent-based analyses may be applied in an interactive manner based on observed population considerations to provide estimates of parameters such as migration, historical population sizes, and to test for evolutionary scenarios that reflect various demographic outcomes. As new pathogens in these groups emerge, species previously unknown to science yet related to known pathogens in these groups will be described, illustrated, and characterized. Taxonomic monographs will be published and made available as online resources as well as PCR-based diagnostic assays for pathogens of agronomic significance.',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): The objectives of this project are to 1) Characterize unknown and poorly described pathogens (primarily viruses and viroids) and diseases highly significant to the USDA plant germplasm quarantine program; 2) Develop and transfer sensitive, reliable, and cost-effective methods to clientele for the rapid detection of virus and virus-like pathogens of quarantine significance; and 3) Develop and transfer methods to clientele for the therapeutic elimination of virus and virus-like pathogens from infected plant genetic resources. The objectives focus on characterizing quarantine pathogens and determining the causal agents responsible for diseases that could threaten U.S. agriculture and ecosystems, and developing tools to effectively detect and eliminate them. The research areas are developed in consultation with USDA-APHIS and the data, protocols, and tools developed by this project are shared with them. Because problems that require immediate investigation can arise rapidly in the plant quarantine system, this project will remain flexible to allocate resources to new or emerging quarantine problems as warranted.  Approach: Conduct laboratory and greenhouse research to identify new methodologies and protocols for diagnostic testing of quarantined plant germplasm, with emphasis on highly sensitive molecular techniques that can shorten the duration time that material is held in quarantine and increase the reliability of indexing programs.  Determine the etiology of poorly described quarantine diseases using a wide range of greenhouse and laboratory techniques.  Conduct molecular characterization studies of quarantine pathogens and investigate their genetic diversity in order to refine and optimize testing methods. Develop protocols for the in vitro cultivation of prohibited genera germplasm and the therapeutic elimination of quarantine pathogens, thereby ensuring that valuable and sometimes unique and endangered germplasm is available for safeguarding and utilization. Transfer research data, protocols, and products to USDA-APHIS for incorporation into testing programs and to support science-based regulatory decisions.',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): Objective 1:  Describe the pathogen biology of exotic and emerging plant pathogens affecting horticultural crops. Objective 2:  Apply knowledge of biology, ecology, and epidemiology of economically important plant pathogens to the development of improved integrated disease management approaches.  Approach: The biology of exotic, emerging, and re-emerging plant pathogens is either poorly understood or inadequate to enable economic and environmentally sustainable management.   Objective 1:  We will develop and test methods for monitoring pathogen dispersion and describe the evolutionary history, population structure, genetics, epidemiology, and ecology of these pathogens.   Objective 2:  This knowledge will then be used to develop decision support tools for producers of horticultural crops. Once an increased understanding of a pathogen’s biology has been developed, this knowledge needs to be translated into disease management strategies that are continually optimized and/or improved based on new knowledge.  We will develop and improve disease management strategies for select pathogens affecting horticultural crops.  While this objective cannot be achieved directly for quarantine pathogens (e.g. P. ramorum), concepts and approaches can be tested by using proxy pathosystems that are similar in the event of an exotic pathogen introduction or quarantines are lifted.  In addition, development and improvement of integrated disease management strategies for endemic pathogens will improve our ability to respond to changing climatic conditions while enhancing the economic and sustainable production of horticultural crops.',\n",
       " \"Given a graph, like a social/computer network or the blogosphere, in which an infection (or meme or virus) has been spreading for some time, how does one select the k best nodes for immunization/quarantining immediately? This team was the first to show that the propagation (specifically, the so-called  epidemic threshold ) depends on a single number, the first eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network, for any graph and almost any propagation model in the literature. This team also gave linear-time provably near-optimal algorithms for static pre-emptive node/edge removal, by minimizing the eigenvalue on arbitrary graphs. They were also the first to give a a linear-time algorithm to automatically detect the number and identity of possible culprits under perfect information, carefully using the Minimum Description Length principle, again on arbitrary graphs.  The major thrust of this proposal is: Given a graph, a virus model (SIR, SIS etc.), a set of already infected nodes, and a fixedbudget of k nodes/edges to immunize or quarantine, can one quickly find an optimal or near-optimal solution to best contain the virus?Technical Merit: This is the first to study the short-term immunization problem on arbitrary graphs. The problem has received limited attention in past literature:  the few current results (except the PI''s past work, see related work) all are on specific graphs like random graphs, and not arbitrary graphs. The focus of this work is on scalable techniques (linear or sub-quadratic on nodes/edges) which can be applied to large graphs.Impact: The work has numerous immediate applications in public health and epidemiology, e.g., designing dynamic  what to do next  policies etc. Leveraging state-of-the-art simulators from the Virginia Bio-Informatics Institute, this work helps in realistic simulations, as well as in making more informed choices and policy decisions for future. The work also has high broader impact, as propagation-style processes on networks appear in many other settings like viral marketing, cyber security, social media like Twitter and blogs etc.Education: The PI will incorporate research findings in graduate level classes, give tutorials at conferences, and aim to engage undergraduate students from underrepresented groups into this exciting area of research through programs like NSF REU and MAOP/VTURCS (Minority Academic Opportunities Program and VT Undergraduate Research in CS) at VT.For further information, please see the project web page: URL:  http://www.cs.vt.edu/~badityap/NSF-PROJECTS/EAGER-13/\",\n",

       " \"Adding reactive nitrogen, from fertilizer, deposition, or nitrogen fixing plants, to ecosystems can cause rapid and often detrimental changes considered undesirable by humans. The creation of dinitrogen gas (N2) through a process called denitrification is the primary mechanism that removes reactive nitrogen from an ecosystem. However, this process can also produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas. Therefore, understanding how much N2 versus N2O is produced during denitrification is critical to understanding both climate and ecosystem nutrient balance. One of the challenges of studying denitrification in the real world is that it is very difficult to measure the production of N2 in the field. The work proposed here will take advantage of a new lab measurement technique to measure the production of N2 from soils and examine how denitrification, N2 and N2O production and nitrogen cycling change after the expansion of a nitrogen-fixing trees into an arid subtropical grassland.Arid lands occupy nearly a third of the Earth''s surface and support large human populations, so understanding the processing of nitrogen in these systems is important for future land use and global climate management. This project will provide the first estimate of the N2 loss occurring during denitrification in an arid system nitrogen cycle, and help to refine a method that can then be applied to other sites and ecosystems. The primary research site used in this project is an active cattle ranch in Southern Texas that is regularly visited by students, land managers and nature enthusiasts. This project will take advantage of this public interface to educate on the effects and importance of human-driven landscape changes on ecosystem nutrient cycling.\",\n",
       " 'Human activities have more than doubled nitrogen pollution of the environment through the use of agricultural fertilizer and deposition from fossil fuel burning. This has important ecological consequences, yet the fate of nitrogen in ecosystems is poorly understood. Previous work on nitrogen budgets have found that a large fraction of added nitrogen cannot be accounted for. One of the ways this nitrogen might not show up in the budget is if it is converted to a gas. This can occur through a process called denitrification, which creates harmless dinitrogen gas (N2). However, this pathway can release harmful intermediates, such as nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide, with the latter being a potent greenhouse gas. Therefore, understanding the factors controlling the rate of leakage, which could include the nature of the microbial community or the soil properties, is important if we are to have an accurate understanding of the fate of nitrogen added to soil systems. One of the challenges faced in doing this type of work is quantifying denitrification intermediates and, especially, N2, since it is difficult to distinguish the N2 produced from denitrification from that present in the atmosphere. The work proposed here will take advantage of a novel sampling robot that can measure and quantify the production of all intermediates and N2 from soils. In addition to measuring intermediate release we will identify the active bacterial communities responsible for denitrification through sequencing of the active genes. By taking a two-pronged approach we can more accurately define the factors controlling nitrogen flow in ecosystems.This project will explore the relationship between the active soil microbial community and rates of denitrification, an essential ecosystem process which has implications on global climate change. Data collected from this research will strengthen interdisciplinary research that involves the fields of microbiology, ecology, biogeochemistry and bioinformatics. The microbial sequencing data will be made publicly available, and the data will be especially useful for the development of undergraduate classroom materials for bioinformatics training at both the introductory and advanced level. This project will also foster training of undergraduate students in microbiology and biogeochemical sciences.

       " 'Organisms often form intimate relationships with one another called symbioses.  Sometimes these relationships result in the sharing of duties needed for each partner to survive.  For example, human head lice have bacterial symbionts that synthesize vitamins that are needed for louse survival.  A defining characteristic of bacterial symbionts is their very small genomes, which results from a process of gene loss during symbiosis.  There is strong evidence that gene loss is ongoing in the bacterial symbionts of human head lice, which makes them an ideal model system to study how symbiosis influences genome evolution.  The proposed research will use advanced DNA sequencing technologies and high-performance computing to sequence the genomes of bacterial symbionts of lice that infect humans and chimpanzees.  Using comparative genomics, the research team will determine which genes were lost in symbiosis and when.This research is critical to understand how symbiosis rapidly alters genomes.  Although this research focuses on symbionts that are beneficial to their host, deadly pathogens undergo a similar process of gene loss, and the results of this study can be broadly applied to all symbionts, beneficial or otherwise.

       " 'This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project will entail the development of a microfluidic colorimetric analyzer to yield quantitative field measurements out of essential inorganic nutrients (initially nitrite and nitrate, thereafter ammonium and orthophosphate). This analyzer will primarily be used in industrial farms where algae are grown to produce biofuel. Inorganic nutrients affect not only the amount of algae biomass generated, but also its lipid content. Maximizing algae biofuel production requires a series of steps, each associated with an optimal nutrient concentration. The amount of nutrient must be measured on a frequent basis as the timescales associated with algae growth are short. Currently, nutrient concentration data is obtained at rates that are too slow to permit maximization of algae production. This problem is being addressed through the development of a small inexpensive colorimetric analyzer that will perform real-time measurement. The design of this instrument is optimized for prolonged unattended field operations, and minimal maintenance and consumption of supplies. It uses EPA-approved analytical chemistries. These have been selected because they are the least susceptible to interference from other compounds present in the algae bioreactors and/or ponds.The broader impact/commercial potential of this project effects US energy policy. The world is gradually running out of fossil oil. Renewable biofuels are increasingly seen as a key element of the US energy future. Algae, a source of oily biomass, are a leading candidate to meet biofuel needs. They can yield more fuel per acre than any other crops, they have the capability to grow in freshwater, as well as saltwater, and they are able to flourish in poor agricultural soil, which will reduce pressure on food prices. Furthermore, algae can grow using wastewater as nutrient feedstock. This reduces the ecological impact of wastewater discharges. Presently, the production of biofuel from algae is cost prohibitive due to high culturing and processing costs. Improving the management of inorganic nutrient levels in ponds and reactors where algae are grown will play a significant role in lowering biofuel production costs, ultimately making biofuels competitive with fossil fuels.',\n",

Although medical therapy can improve outcomes, data suggest that proven therapies continue to be underutilized. Current guidelines suggest that treatment be titrated toward the target doses used in clinical trials, but  clinical inertia  often represents a barrier to aggressive titration of medical therap for both providers and patients. There is a pressing need to develop strategies to improve the utilization of proven therapies for chronic HF in order to improve outcomes. The natriuretic peptides are biomarkers of hemodynamic stress that provide important prognostic information in HF. Changes in natriuretic peptide levels over time are strongly associated with outcomes, and HF therapies proven to have beneficial effects outcomes decrease natriuretic peptide levels over time. These data suggest that serial measurements of natriuretic peptides may serve as a guide to the titration of medical therapy in HF -  biomarker guided therapy.  Although small studies meta-analyses have suggested a decrease in mortality with this approach, there remains an unmet need for a robustly powered study to determine whether biomarker guided therapy improves outcomes in chronic HF. We propose to address this unmet need with the GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment (GUIDE-IT) Study, a randomized clinical trial of biomarker guided therapy in HF. The primary aim of GUIDE-IT is to compare a strategy of medical therapy titrated to a natriuretic peptide target to usual care in 1100 high risk patients with HF. Our primary hypothesis is that biomarker guided therapy will reduce the composite endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first HF hospitalization by 20% compared to usual care over a follow up period of at least 12 months. This application includes a Clinical Coordinating Center, a Data Coordinating Center, and an Economics-Quality of Life core lab. GUIDE-IT will test an innovative model of HF management-the individualized titration of medical therapy to a physiologic target rather than a  one size fits all  approach. Results of GUIDE-IT will be guideline changing and have immediate clinical implications for the management of millions of Americans living with chronic HF.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of adult leukemia and is incurable with currently available therapies. One promising form of treatment has been antibody therapy, where CLL cells are targeted by anti-CD20 antibodies such as rituximab and ofatumumab. This has led to significant improvements in survival, especially in combination with other therapies, but complete remissions are still relatively rare. Monocytes and macrophages are critical mediators of antibody therapy, and this depends upon Fc? receptor (Fc?R) activity. We have found that activation of these Fc?R leads to production of sFlt-1, a soluble, inhibitory form of the VEGF receptor. sFlt-1 can inhibit VEGF signaling, which has been shown to play a major role in CLL cell survival. These results led us to hypothesize that Fc?R-mediated sFlt-1 production can dampen anti- apoptotic signals in CLL cells, and that this accounts for a significant portion of antibody-mediated antitumor effects. Hence, strengthening monocyte / macrophage sFlt-1 production within the context of antibody therapy may be a powerful means of enhancing its effectiveness. To test the predictions of this hypothesis we propose: Aim 1: Analysis of sFlt-1 production and function in response to anti-CD20. Here, we will a) identify the cells primarily responsible for sFlt-1 production upon binding anti-CD20 antibodies, examine the effect of sFlt-1 on CLL cell survival, and study the mechanism(s) by which VEGF-mediated survival in tumor cells is inhibited. We will also b) examine whether sFlt-1 production by monocytes makes CLL cells more susceptible to direct apoptosis in response to agents in use preclinically and clinically for the treatment of CLL. Aim 2: Analysis of sFlt-1 production and function in antibody treatment in vivo. We will use established murine models of CLL to a) test whether sFlt-1 is produced during antibody-mediated B cell depletion using a murine CD20 antibody, b) identify relevant Fc?R-bearing effector cell(s) responsible for sFlt-1 production, c) test whether neutralizing sFlt-1 reduces theefficacy of anti-CD20 antibody in a murine CLL model, and d) Whether sFlt-1 levels in CLL patients receiving monotherapy with ofatumumab correlate with response and progression free survival. Aim 3: Elucidation of mechanism of sFlt-1 induction by Fc?R clustering. Here, we will determine a) which activating Fc?R is responsible for sFlt-1 induction and whether this induction is negatively regulated by Fc?RIIb and SHIP, b) whether Fc?R-induced sFlt-1 production is a direct or indirect effect, and c) the signaling pathway(s) involved in sFlt-1 induction. Summary: At completion of this study we will have fully explored an entire new mechanism of anti-CD20 mediated killing of tumor cells by monocytes and macrophages. These mechanistic studies will provide information to further enhance the efficacy of both anti-CD20 antibodies such as ofatumumab in CLL but potentially a wide variety of other tumors where similar antibody based treatments are utilized.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this work is to understand adaptation in microbial populations, using a combination of mathematical modeling and high-throughput experimental evolution in budding yeast. Specifically, we aim to predict how evolution chooses probabilistically among the spectrum of possible mutational trajectories in these populations. In the short term, evolution depends primarily on the distribution of fitness effects of individual mutations. However, on longer timescales epistatic interactions between mutations can be crucial for adaptation. Similarly, mutations often have different fitness effects in different environments ( pleiotropy for fitness ). This is essential to long-term adaptation in fluctuating environments. Recent work shows that epistasis and pleiotropy for fitness are strong and common among specific sets of mutations in many microbial and viral systems. However, these studies of specific limited sets of mutations cannot fully explain how epistasis and pleiotropy constrain the rate, repeatability, or dynamics of adaptation in microbial populations. And even given a complete set of epistatic and pleiotropic interactions, we cannot predict how evolution will act in all but a few particularly simple cases. This severely limits our ability to predict th evolution of complex phenotypes, such as compensated antibiotic resistance, multiple mutations required for immune escape, or multiple gene knockouts enabling cancer evolution. The central objective of this proposal is to examine the role of epistasis and pleiotropy for fitness in the evolution of microbial populations. Rather than characterizing specific examples, we propose to survey the overall statistics of epistasis and pleiotropy that are relevant for constraining microbial adaptation. We will then predict how this epistasis and pleiotropy alters how evolution chooses among possible mutational trajectories. In Aim 1, we will measure the statistics of epistasis using a novel strategy for high-throughput experimental evolution. Specifically, we will determine the statistical tendency of different mutational trajectories to diverge in their long-tem prospects. In Aim 2, we will predict how epistasis interacts with genetic variation to constrain th evolution of microbial populations, and test these predictions with laboratory evolution in budding yeast. Finally, in Aim 3, we will measure how the fitness effects of mutations change across related environments and predict how this alters the course of microbial adaptation. We will focus on environmental fluctuations that are particularly common in the evolution of microbial populations, such as adaptation to fluctuating nutrient concentrations and varying intensities of environmental stresses. In contrast to recent work probing epistasis and pleiotropy between small and specific sets of mutations, our approach will provide a comprehensive picture of the degree to which these factors alter the course of microbial evolution.',\n",

Rodents currently housed elsewhere on campus will be moved into WIMR following successful embryo or cesarean rederivation. We seek to outfit three currently unequipped animal housing rooms (total 696 assignable square feet, ASF) with high-density caging and to properly equip the two adjacent procedure rooms (total 222 ASF). These rooms will provide animal housing for SMPH researchers affiliated with the Cardiovascular and Regenerative Medicine research floor of WIMR Phase II, which was supported by NIH ARRA C06 construction funding. These rooms will be utilized by 18 investigators and will have impact on research projects totaling more than $14 million in annual funding. The SMPH initially invested $12.6M for construction of the WIMR rodent vivarium including equipment for cage washing, sterilization, and bulk bedding dispensing. An additional $1.2M was allocated to purchase equipment for Suite 1 (of eight suites). Current university support includes an additional $3.9M to purchase equipment for Suites 2, 3, and 4 and a quarantine area, and $488,470 in SMPH matching funds to complete Suite 5 as outlined in this proposal. The proposed additions to the WIMR rodent vivarium Suite 5 include the purchase of high-density housing racks and cages, biosafety cabinets, a chemical fume hood, and an anesthesia station. These additions to the facility will provide researchers space within the footprint of the vivarium for animal housing and experimental procedures.',\n",
       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of the insulin producing ¿ cells of the islets of Langerhans. Our work and that of others in murine models has shown that transferring genes for immunoregulatory molecules to ¿ cells in vivo in the endogenous pancreas or in vitro in islet grafts, effectively suppresses autoimmunity and promotes islet transplantation tolerance, respectively. We have been using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene transfer to manipulate the immunogenicity of murine ¿ cells in vivo and in vitro. AAV vector technology has rapidly advanced and clinical trials have demonstrated successful application of this gene delivery strategy. With this in mind, the goal of our R21 proposal is to develop AAV vectors with increased tropism for human ¿ cells in vivo and in vitro. A two-pronged approach will be taken. First, we will employ a panel of wild-type AAV capsid proteins to identify those capsids that efficiently transduce human ¿ cells in vitro, and in an in vivo model. Secondly, an effort will be made to engineer novel AAV capsid variants that selectively transduce human ¿ cells in vivo and in vitro, and which evade human AAV neutralizing antibodies. Here  DNA shuffling  of AAV capsid genes combined with directed evolution will be used to develop novel ¿ cell-specific AAV capsids. Experiments will also include testing the efficacy of AAV vector treatment to block immune-mediated destruction of human ¿ cells in vivo. Together, this work will provide a better understanding of the transduction properties of AAV capsids for human ¿ cells, and will identify/generate capsids that can be directly tested in the clinic. In this way, initial steps wil be taken towards our long-term goal of using AAV vectors to establish ¿ cell-specific and/or islet graft tolerance for human T1D.',\n",

MBP focuses on expanding knowledge ofthe biology of laboratory mice and on the application of genetically-altered mice in biomedical research. Among the many projects relying on MBP support and vivarium services are the NIH/NCRR's Mutant Mouse Regional Resources Centers (MMRRC) and the trans-NIH Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository. MBP is already engaged in working with investigators around the globe coordinating rodent imports and exports; creating, expanding and cryoarchiving lines of genetically altered mice; assisting research planning using genetically altered mice (age, gender, number, genetic background, special husbandry requirements, etc); and providing stewardship and oversight of animal care and health for all mice housed in MBP. With the MBP operational and management program within the University and our close working relationship with the UCD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (lACUC), the Attending Veterinarian, and rodent infectious disease specialists, MBP has wide latitude in the importation, quarantine and housing of mice of varying health statuses. With this experience and these operational programs in place, we are uniquely qualified to provide rodent importation, acclimation/quarantine, housing, health monitoring and project scheduling that will be conducive for rapid and efficient evaluation of strains submitted to MMPC-UCD for phenotyping.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diastolic heart failure (HF), also known as  heart failure-preserved-ejection fraction , accounts for up to 50% of all HF presentations, but unlike systolic HF, therapies remain ineffective despite increasing morbidity and mortality. This stems, in part, from a lack of mechanistic understanding about diastolic HF. Hypertension is the major cause of diastolic HF and the prevalence of diastolic HF is projected to increase as the incidence of hypertension rises. Obese individuals also have a high incidence of poorly controlled blood pressure and diastolic HF. This raises the possibility that factors secreted by fa may play a role in hypertension-related diastolic HF. Although a causal link exists between aldosterone and arterial hypertension, increasing evidence demonstrates a link between aldosterone and obesity with evidence that adipocytes, in addition to secreting adiponectin (APN), may release secreted factors that stimulate aldosterone release independent of angiotensin-II. APN, an adipose-derived plasma protein, exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertrophic effects by modulating phosphorylation signals in cardiovascular cells and is implicated in the development of hypertension and systolic HF. APN levels are decreased in obesity and hypertension, but elevated in systolic HF, also known as  heart failure-reduced-ejection fraction . Conversely aldosterone is increased in obesity, hypertension and in HF. Recently our lab showed that hypoadiponectinemia in hypertension-induced diastolic HF exacerbates left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and diastolic HF. We seek to examine the contribution of APN to the relative increase in aldosterone in diastolic HF. The broad objective of this proposal is that dysregulation between aldosterone and APN contributes to the pathogenesis of diastolic HF and adverse cardiac remodeling. To our knowledge this conceptual model has not been tested nor hypothesized. We will test the hypothesis that an alteration in APN levels facilitates an increase in aldosterone increasing the propensity to diastolic HF and diastolic dysfunction. To address this hypothesis we will test the following aims:Aim 1) to investigate if dysregulation of APN levels are associated with alterations in aldosterone levels in human diastolic HF. Hypothesis 1. Aldosterone and APN levels are elevated in stable diastolic HF patients and are associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction measurements. Hypothesis 2. Changes in aldosterone and APN levels (between acutely, decompensated and stable, ambulatory diastolic HF) are associated with disease progression (as determined by echocardiographic derived measures of LV diastolic dysfunction) in diastolic HF. Aim 2) To determine if APN ameliorates the transition from hypertension to diastolic dysfunction and diastolic HF in a mouse model of diastolic HF and dysfunction. Aim 3) To investigate the role of autophagy in diastolic dysfunction in cardiac myocytes and the signaling mechanisms involved in cell-to-cell communication between cardiac myocytes and adipocytes in diastolic HF.',\n",

       " \"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Robust regeneration of tissues and complex organs is the norm for countless invertebrate and nonmammalian vertebrate species. In addition, nature has endowed certain animals with remarkable longevity and robust tissue repair mechanisms that slow aging-induced degenerative processes, or with increased susceptibility to cellular and molecular damage and concomitantly short lifespans. Numerous fundamental questions in regenerative biology can only be answered in vivo using diverse non-mammalian animal models. In addition, comparative studies of diverse organisms provide deeper mechanistic insights that are not possible using a single model or  model-centric  approach, and they can speed the pace and reduce the cost of biomedical discovery. The Comparative Animal Models Core builds on MDIBL's unique strength and expertise in comparative animal biology and will provide COBRE investigators with resources necessary to utilize diverse animal models in regenerative and aging biology research. For the current application, the Core focuses primarily on providing resources and services to COBRE Project Leaders for their proposed zebrafish studies. These resources include day-to-day husbandry, importation and quarantine services, spawning services to produce embryos for experimental studies, microinjection and surgical services, drug treatment services and genotyping using visual inspection and PCR-based methods. The Core will also have both the facilities and expertise necessary to provide COBRE associated investigators as well as potential new COBRE Project Leaders with resources for other vertebrate and invertebrate model systems useful in regenerative and aging biology research including C. elegans, amphibians and various fish species. Our long term goal is to develop the Core into a one-of-a-kind animal resource by leveraging the scientific background and expertise of the Core Director, his staff and MDIBL's faculty, as well as MDIBL's 113-year history of providing and maintaining diverse marine organisms for biomedical research. The Comparative Animal Models Core will thus contribute not only to the success and long term sustainability of the COBRE, but also to the success and continued growth of MDIBL and biomedical research in Maine.\",\n",

       " \"Project SummaryResults from clinical trials demonstrate that significant, sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction inpeople with glaucoma slows or halts vision loss, even in patients with low-tension glaucoma. While theetiology of ocular hypertension in glaucoma is known to involve the conventional drainage pathway, thecellular mechanisms responsible for generation of this extra resistance are unknown. It seems likely that thehomeostatic mechanisms that regulate IOP in people with ocular hypertension are defective and may besimilar to those involved in the regulation of systemic blood pressure, including those that regulate vasculartone. A key signaling molecule for local regulation of vascular tone is nitric oxide (NO), a free radicalproduced in vascular endothelia by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Our central hypothesis, supported bystrong preliminary data, is that IOP-dependent shear stress within Schlemm's canal (SC) is a key playerwithin a dynamic endogenous signaling system ( feedback loop ) that regulates conventional outflowresistance through NO production. In some glaucomatous individuals, this shear stress-NO system may becompromised, leading ultimately to increased outflow resistance and elevated IOP. The goal of the presentproposal is to test this hypothesis by careful examination of the effect of elevated IOP and shear stress in SCand establish the determinants of, and the time course for, NO production by SC cells (aim 1).Consequences of shear and NO production on SC monolayer permeability and trabecular meshwork cellcontractility (and flow patterns through the trabecular meshwork) are looked at independently in aim 2 andaim 3, respectively.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid hormone involved in maintaining fluid and electrolyte (sodium) balance in the human body. However, abnormalities in aldosterone production and secretion from the adrenal gland result in and/or exacerbate several human diseases including high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. These disorders are prevalent in the veteran population, with nearly 3.5 million veterans diagnosed with hypertension and approximately 10% of these with congestive heart failure. Similarly, many veterans are overweight or obese, with the attendant disorders associated with excess weight, including hypertension. The mechanism by which excess weight causes hypertension is unclear; however, some studies have suggested a link with increased aldosterone levels. Our recent novel results demonstrate that physiological concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) stimulate aldosterone production in multiple zona glomerulosa cell models in vitro. This result suggests a possible mechanism by which obesity, which is associated with elevated VLDL levels (dyslipidemia), can result in hypertension resulting, at least in part, from inappropriate aldosterone secretion. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying VLDL-induced aldosterone production, three specific aims are proposed in this study: (1) test the hypothesis that physiological and pathophysiological VLDL concentrations will enhance the response to other physiological stimulators of aldosterone production and determine the signaling mechanisms involved in the stimulatory action of VLDL, (2) test the hypothesis  that a lipid component of VLDL elicits aldosterone secretion and define this active component, and (3) test the hypothesis that ablation of the gene encoding phospholipase D2 (PLD2), an important signal mediating aldosterone production in vitro, also regulates aldosterone levels in vivo, basally and with elevated VLDL levels related to diet-induced obesity. These hypotheses will be tested by monitoring aldosterone production in  glomerulosa cell models treated with various concentrations of VLDL and other aldosterone agonists. In addition, the signal transduction mechanisms utilized by VLDL will be defined using overexpression and RNA interference-mediated knock down strategies to influence the levels of signaling molecules followed by a determination of the effect of these manipulations on VLDL-induced aldosterone production. Pretreatment to denature/degrade the protein and extraction of the lipids comprising VLDL, as well as lipidomics to identify  VLDL lipid components, will be used to determine the agent in VLDL responsible for stimulating aldosterone production. The role of this VLDL component will be verified in studies determining the aldosterone stimulatory effect of VLDL pretreated using enrichment and depletion strategies to alter levels of the identified active agent. In vivo a PLD2 knockout mouse model will be used to determine the effects of the loss of PLD2 on  aldosterone levels and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression in the adrenal basally and upon chronic angiotensin II infusion or with diet-induced obesity. The proposed studies examining the ability of VLDL to modulate aldosterone production will expand our knowledge of the role of obesity-increased VLDL levels in the development of hypertension in obese and/or lean individuals, as well as the possible involvement of abnormalities in the VLDL-activated signals in hypertension in these individuals.',\n",

This will be accomplished through the development of new farmers within Chicago and providing direct market access for these low-resource farmers to sell their product to outlets that serve the communities most in need of fresh and healthy food options. It also includes a comprehensive collaboration on ending food insecurity by engaging the local communities most affected by lack of food access choices as well as engaging local business, corporate partners, and city officials. Infrastructure support will be provided to community groups to sustain urban farms and employment opportunities.Through advanced training and farm and marketing infrastructure development, Growing Power will work with food desert communities to secure land, build farms and mentor farmers within designated food desert communities. New farmers will be provided with opportunities for land access through a new 7-acre urban farm in partnership with the Chicago Park District and other city owned land as well as shared infrastructure and resources (compost, seeds, tools, hoop house construction). These new farmers and food entrepreneurs will be provided with direct market access for their product through a new aggregation pilot that will provide fresh produce to a variety of commercial retailers, corner stores, farmers&#39; markets, and local businesses.',\n",
       " 'Antibiotic usage is widespread in the livestock industry but this has recently raised concerns because of its potential to increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. While this may have direct consequences for human health and well-being, exposure to antibiotics is also likely to lead to change in the soil microbial community and the ecosystem processes that these communities regulate, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycling. The linkage between antibiotics, microbial communities, and elemental cycles has not been examined. We propose to examine this linkage and expect that antibiotic effects on microbial communities will be akin to a stress-response. That is, while microbial death may occur with initial exposure to antibiotics, the microbial community will begin to develop resistance, leading to increased maintenance demands and decreased microbial growth. The stress-response not only impacts the microbial community but also the elemental cycles it regulates, i.e. stress leads to both greater respiration and mobilization of nitrogen and phosphorus. This means that site fertility and sustainability may be reduced under antibiotic use. To determine this potential, we propose to examine the effect of antibiotic exposure on microbial communities and the consequences of this for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in relevant agroecosystems. Using a combination of experimental approaches, our proposed goals aim to understand: 1)Antibiotic implications for microbial communities and elemental cycles in active agroecosystems; 2) The time course of antibiotic effects on elemental cycles; and 3) The effect of antibioitic interactions on communities and elemental cycles.',\n",
       " 'As the nation becomes increasingly urbanized, an increasing number of adults are less likely to have had direct experiences with the land in their youth. Consequently, the rising generation is less able to view production agriculture as the system that it actually is. Many aspects of this system are monitored at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville Pioneer Farm, the project site. However, Pioneer Farm and the UW-Platteville School of Agriculture need to build capacity in order to disseminate to the rising generation what is currently known about the production agriculture system and to enhance its monitoring network to fully capture all hydrologic process on the farm. We propose to meet these needs in three ways: through education of undergraduates in agriculture-related fields; through outreach to young people via collaboration with 4-H; and by enhancing the research capacity of Pioneer Farm to be better able to measure all effects of water movement across and within the production agriculture system.',\n",
       " 'Nursery and greenhouse crops account for $16 billion of the United States economy. The nursery industry is complex due to the large number of plant species grown, which makes nursery pest management research challenging. Pests that have large economic impacts, attack multiple, high production genera and are quarantine restricted are key targets for research. One major problem impacting the nursery industry today is ambrosia beetles. These beetles feed and reproduce within living or dead trees. The beetles are difficult to control with conventional pesticides, and in the nursery industry, even cosmetic damage from the beetles can result in trees that are unsalable. The overall goal of this project is to investigate new tools for the integrated management of ambrosia beetles in nursery crops. The three areas of inquiry include (1) the identification of new attractants and repellents, (2) applications of the plant defensive hormones methyl salicylate or methyl jasmonate as nursery tree protective treatments, and (3) the recruitment of predators into nursery stands as a biological control option. These objectives will be accomplished through field and laboratory assays conducted at Tennessee State University&#39;s Nursery Research Center, located at the center of Tennessee&#39;s nursery production industry. The availability of additional management approaches based on any combination of attractants, repellents, plant hormone treatments and natural enemy augmentation will move the nursery industry toward an integrated approach to ambrosia beetle management and away from sole reliance on conventional pesticides.',\n",
       " 'Globodera pallida (Pale Cyst Nematode - PCN) is an internationally recognized quarantine pest of potato and can cause up to 80% yield loss. It was first found in Idaho in 2006 and placed under Federal Domestic Quarantine Order and State Rule. An extensive effort to eradicate PCN is underway in Idaho by fumigating infested fields with methyl bromide. However, worldwide methyl bromide is being phased out and will no longer be available for use. This proposal addresses the need for MeBr alternatives for quarantine exemptions; specifically the exemption for PCN eradication. Our long-term goals are to develop and deploy biologically-based alternative eradication measures for potato cyst nematodes, to replace currently-used methyl bromide fumigation. We are developing a comprehensive strategy which includes 1) trap-crops to stimulate nematode hatching without allowing reproduction, 2) fungal biocontrol agents that attack nematode cysts and eggs, 3) optimized combinations of the above two methods, 4) economic analysis of these two methods compared to MeBr fumigations, and 5) extension and outreach activities for effective technology transfer to stakeholders.',\n",
       " \"The invasive glassy-winged sharpshooter has been associated (as a vector) with serious outbreaks of oleander leaf scorch and Pierce's disease of grapes in southern and central California. Within the state, exactly where this species can survive and reproduce is unknown. No predictive modeling based on actual insect life history requirements has been performed to determine the geographical and environmental limits for this insect. The development of such a model will allow a concentration of limited resources for management and control to those areas most likely at risk of infestation. The agricultural sector most heavily impacted by this insect has been the commercial nursery industry. This is due to the extremely costly intra- and inter-state quarantine measures restricting movement of nursery products from the sharpshooter-infested southern portions of the state where much of California's ornamental nursery production is located. As of this date, research from this project has led to an approved state-wide approved treatment program that allows transport of nursery shipments without inspections. Unfortunately this program is entirely reliant on two chemical insecticides, one of which is likely to be phased out in the next few years. Thus a main objective of this research is to continue to seek approaches and treatments to dis-infest nursery shipments of all stages of the glassy-winged sharpshooter.\",\n",
       " 'Situation California experiences yearly a large number of new insect pests that affect both agriculture and natural habitats. Over the period 1955 -1988 a total of 208 exotic invertebrates established in California. With the increase in worldwide shipping this rate of new arrivals is expected only to increase in the foreseeable future. These pests affect agriculture, either because they inflict direct damage to crops, or because their presence causes the imposition of quarantine measures. Particularly damaging are pest species that are the vectors of different plant pathogens. Many of our natural habitats are also affected by the arrival of invasive species. The total cost of just the agriculturally important invasive pests is estimated to be $ 3 billion annually in California alone, while nationally it is estimated to be at least $13.9 billion Purpose This project applies various DNA based techniques to help in the early recognition of invasive species and to pin-point the origin of the invasive population. Once we know where the invasive species originated we can collect natural enemies from the same area and apply them to control the pest in the area where it invaded. In addition we study the genetic factors that correlate with the success of natural enemies. This work will help in a more rapid control of pest insects once they are established.',\n",
       " 'Food system participants are giving increasing attention to ensuring that production, distribution, and consumption activities are sustainable from an environmental, economic, and social standpoint. The food system is based upon biological processes that can have important positive and negative environmental impacts; it is critical for human health; it is a key point of interaction between humans and other living organisms; it is responsible for a significant share of economic activity in most developed and developing economies; and it is an important aspect of the culture that binds a society together. The terms  sustainable  and  food system  are often used without explicit definitions. A food system is an interconnected set of biological, technological, economic, and social activities and processes that nourish human populations and provide livelihood and satisfaction to the people who participate in it. A food system encompasses activities that extend from the provision of inputs for primary food production through farming, food processing and manufacturing, food distribution and retailing, consumption, and post-consumption food waste. A food system is sustainable if it can maintain or improve its performance over the long term. This means that it operates in a manner that does not degrade the fundamental environmental, human, and societal resources that support it. The processes that make up a food system are evolving as technology, the economy, and the environment develop and change. This project focuses on two sets of issues related to sustainable food systems: (1) the economics of organic agricultural production and (2) the design and assessment of supply chain relationships that govern flows of products, resources, and information within the food system. Organic production represents a small but growing segment of U.S. agricultural production. Organic production systems differ fundamentally from conventional production systems in their underlying philosophy and in the set of practices and technologies they use. It is highly unlikely that organic production will completely supplant conventional systems that rely on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and genetically modified organisms. Nevertheless, there is a need, addressed by this project, to understand how organic systems compare to conventional alternatives and to identify technological, managerial, and policy changes that can make organic production systems more efficient. Food reaches consumers through supply chains that coordinate the actions of individuals and firms operating at very different scales. Often, significant opportunities for improving overall food system sustainability are to be found at the interfaces between supply chain segments. For example, contractual relationships and business processes in the processing and distribution segments of fresh produce supply chains can have important impacts on spatial patterns of production, transportation fuel use, and the distribution of revenues and costs among supply chain participants. There is a continuing need, addressed by this project, to better understand supply chain design alternatives.',\n",
       " 'Bed bugs have severe adverse effects on health and quality of life. Presence of bed bugs in such intimate places as beds and bedrooms often create anxiety and people who are repeatedly bitten may develop nervous behavior, agitation, stress and sleeplessness. Bites of bed bugs can produce itchy welts and vigorous scratching and concomitant erosions predispose the skin to secondary bacterial infection. The adverse effects caused by bed bugs to humans have led the Environmental Protection Agency and CDC to consider this pest of significant public health importance. Bed bugs also have an economic impact, as infestations often require expensive on-going inspections and treatments, disposal and replacement of infested beds and other furnishings, and quarantine of infested areas. In public facilities, they may result in adverse publicity and litigation by persons who are bitten.',\n",
       " 'Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is a disease of livestock caused by the VS virus (VSV) of the family Rhabodviridae, genus Vesiculovirus, for which two serotypes, referred to as New Jersey and Indiana, have been described. The disease is characterized by severe vesiculation and ulceration of tongue, oral tissues, feet, and teats. The VSV infects various hosts including horses, cattle, and pigs. In certain conditions, humans and some wildlife species may also become infected. Infection with the VSV is rarely fatal, but it typically has an important impact on the economy because of the direct losses that it causes in infected herds and the imposition of quarantine restrictions that affect animal trade. Vesicular stomatitis is also important in the differential diagnosis of vesicular diseases because its clinical signs in cattle and pigs are indistinguishable from those caused by the infection with the foot-and-mouth disease virus. The United States is regularly affected by VSV incursions. United States States along the Mexican border suffer VS epidemics regularly. The most recent epidemic was reported in New Mexico in April 2012. Fortunately, the area in which the affected herd is located is very low-density in terms of livestock population and no further cases have been identified at this time. In addition to the direct and indirect losses associated to the quarantine imposed to the affected farm, it is also expected that livestock producers in New Mexico may have some restrictions applied to animals moving into other states or internationally. Spread to other States is not uncommon, as occurred, for example, in 2004, 2005, and 2006, when multiple States were affected by VSV. For those reasons, a VSV epidemic in California either this summer or in upcoming years would not be totally unexpected. Genetic evidence suggests that viruses associated with such incursions likely originate from enzootic areas of Mexico. Many aspects of the epidemiological and ecological dynamics of VSV transmission in Mexico remain unknown. Prerequisite for establishing an early warning system for VS in California and the Southern United States is quantitative knowledge on the factors that promote and prevent disease transmission and spread in Mexico. This information will help prevent VS spread into northern Mexico and, ultimately, in California and other bordering states.',\n",
       " 'We need to secure the future economic and environmental sustainability of dairy farming in New York State. To accomplish this, dairy farms should: (1.) increase production efficiency; (2.) reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (3) utilize energy-rich dairy waste (manure) to produce valuable bioenergy. Monensin, which is a feed additive, can address dairy production efficiency needs by changing the activity of microbes in the cow rumen, resulting in increasing milk yields. This will also result in a reduction in methane production by the cow itself. This same compound, however, poses direct problems to the microbial processes that diary farmers use in anaerobic digesters to transform dairy waste into methane (bioenergy). We propose to assess the effects of monensin on the anaerobic digestion of dairy waste, and to determine what strategies are necessary to ensure the stability of bioenergy production at dairy farms that adopt monensin feed additives. Our proposed research would, therefore, ensure sustainable bioenergy production concurrently with the adoption of monensin to increase dairy farm productivity. If we perform this research immediately, it will provide timely results to dairy farmers, who are currently using or considering using monensin, but do not know how it affects anaerobic digestion. Our proposed research will address a number of agricultural and societal needs, including: (1.) boosting dairy production in sustainable ways; (2.) reducing the carbon footprint of dairy farms; and (3.) ensuring stable and sustainable production of bioenergy from dairy waste.',\n",
       " 'An important aspect of breeding for disease resistance to plant pathogenic fungi in all crops, is to have a fundamental understanding of the genetic variation which exists within a given pathogen population. A considerable effort has been made in recent years to develop an understanding of the genetic and molecular diversity which exists in fungal and oomycete populations. This information has been very useful for determining mechanisms which affect variation (asexual and sexual recombination and mutations) within a population and, from a more practical standpoint, has allowed screening efforts to ensure that advanced breeding material is being exposed to the full spectrum of genetic diversity which exists in a contemporary pathogen population. Molecular markers have been particularly useful for examining reproductive strategies of various pathogens and for determining the extent which gene flow occurs within and between populations. In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to improve our understanding of intra- and inter- species variation among plant pathogenic fungi. Fungal and oomycete plant pathogens have served as a particularly good model for studying population variation and speciation events. The impetus for increased efforts in the study of population variation and speciation events can be attributed to: (1) the need to improve disease screening efforts to increase the durability of disease resistant cultivars; (2) the need to more carefully demarcate and name phylogenetically distinct species due to plant health and quarantine issues; and (3) to more accurately document biodiversity among these ecologically vital groups of organisms.',\n",
       " 'Ambrosia beetles are wood boring insects that live in a close symbiosis with fungi. Although naturally harmless, these fungus-transmitting beetles have recently become a major forest health issue worldwide. This is mostly due to several species that, because of human transport, were introduced to non-native regions (for example, many Asian species have been introduced to the US), where their ecology changes, and they become aggressive tree killers. These specie include the redbay ambrosia beetle in the SE US, the granulated ambrosia beetle in the Midwest, several species of platypodine beetles in Korea and Japan, or just recently Euwallacea fornicatus in California and Israel - all of these beetles are invasive, are killing thousands of trees every year, and there is no available management option against them. The question that forest entomologists and forest managers must now solve is why do some exotic ambrosia species become major pests and tree-killers, while many other species remain inconspicuous members of the forest insect community, or entirely fail to establish despite repeated introductions In this project I will test the hypothesis that it is their fungal symbiont that predisposes some ambrosia beetles for successful invasion and tree-killing behavior. Specifically, I will answer three questions: 1) Do successful invasive beetle species preferentially carry plant pathogens, compared to native species 2) Can we recognize beetle species with these pathogens before they arrive to North America, in their native region, and facilitate a focus of quarantine institutions on these particular species To characterize the cryptic symbiotic fungal communities in native and invasive beetles with high accuracy, my approach will combines culture-based identification and next-generation sequencing of fungal metagenomes. To determine if not-yet invaded exotic species are likely to carry plant pathogens upon their arrival, I will analyze their symbiotic communities in the native regions, and test the effect of these symbionts (without the beetle vector) on native American trees in a biologically secure facility. OUTCOMES: We will understand which species of bark and ambrosia beetles from overseas carry pathogens lethal to American economically important trees, and will be able to focus on their eradication, should they be detected on American continet in the future. ----- Because of the recent increase of damage due to ambrosia beetles, and also because of the recent return of native but no less aggressive pests such as the Southern Pine Beetle and the Mountain Pine Beetle, there has been a surge in interest in beetle-related information among stakeholders, researchers, and the media. To respond to this need for up-to-date information on ambrosia and bark beetle pests, the third and equally important part of my project will be the establishment of a Bark Beetle Crash Course. OUTCOME: In this course, world-renowned bark beetle experts will provide training in ecology, classification, and identification of bark beetles for students, professionals, and other stakeholders in intensive lab and field settings.',\n",
       " 'African swine fever (ASF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease in domestic swine with mortality rates approaching 100%. There is no vaccine for ASF and disease control relies solely on quarantine and animal slaughter. Recent devastating ASF disease outbreaks in the Caucasus region and Russia highlight the significance of this disease threat for domestic swine populations world wide. Development of improved ASF disease control strategies has been hindered by large gaps in knowledge of this novel virus, the complexity of virus-host interactions underlying infection and immunity and the epidemiology of disease. Although there is no vaccine for ASF currently available, it is clear that vaccination is possible. Vaccine progress is hindered by the fact that ASFV strain variation and variability and the viral antigens responsible for protective immunity remain unknown. Eight viral serogroups based on hemadsorption inhibition (HAI) have been identified. Notably and of great significance with respect to vaccine development, viruses within serogroups provide cross-protection from challenge with viruses within the serogroup. The viral protein(s)/antigen(s) associated with this serological group specificity and the observed protective immunity are unknown. The objective of this one-year study is to identify ASFV proteins associated with serological group specificity and cross protective immunity. Successful completion of this work will provide critical scientific information on ASFV strain variation and identify putative viral protein(s) associated with protective immunity thus enabling rationale ASFV vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'Nitrogen fertilizer represents the largest input of energy to corn-based cropping systems. However, nitrogen fertilizer is used with poor efficiency (typically &lt;50%). Much of the unused nitrogen fertilizer is lost to air and water resources, representing an economic loss to farmers that can diminish air and water quality. Improvements in our understanding of nitrogen fertiizer use efficiency can ultimately lead to decreases energy use, money savings and improved environmental quality. Recent evidence suggests that the amount of soil organic matter can affect nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency. Using isotopically labeled nitrogen fertilizer, this project will determine how soil organic matter affects the retention and loss of nitrogen fertilizer. Ultimately, this project will provide information that can lead to improvements in nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency.',\n",
       " 'Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in industrial countries. Most infection of humans results from consumption of contaminated and improperly cooked poultry. In the past two decades, intensive research has been devoted to developing resistant lines of poultry, creating effective quarantine methods, and forming elaborate post-processing methods to reduce the transfer of C. jejuni to humans. However, infection rates in poultry and livestock remain high and past reductions in human incidence appear to have stalled well short of the established national target rates. Despite the cost of C. jejuni research, containment, and treatment, relatively little effort has been devoted to understanding the ecology and epidemiology of C. jejuni. Researchers generally focus on poultry, but C. jejuni is a multi-species pathogen that also infects wildlife, particularly wild birds.Understanding the dynamics of transmission between and among domestic animals, wildlife, and humans is a critical step in implementing an effective and comprehensive management plan. Wild birds may act as both reservoirs that harbor C. jejuni at critical times of the year and as vectors for long distance dispersal of non-local C. jejuni strains. Although C. jejuni has been isolated from many wild bird species, crows are among the most likely to play a primary role in cross species transmission because of their high rates of infection and because they are abundant in agricultural and urban settings, leading to high contact rates with poultry, livestock, and humans. Here, I propose to study C. jejuni infection dynamics and cross species transmission between domestic poultry, livestock, and wild American crows in Davis, California. Specifically, I will test two hypotheses that impact food safety and animal production: Wild crows facilitate the transmission of pathogenic C. jejuni between poultry, livestock, and humans. Non-local strains of C. jejuni originate from migratory wild crows. Using the data that I collect in testing each of these hypotheses, I will also build a biologically informed and spatially explicit model of cross-species C. jejuni infection dynamics. This model will be the main deliverable component of my project and will allow me to make predictions about infection dynamics and management recommendations for mitigation efforts.',\n",

Objective 3: Characterize viruses and virus complexes that infect berry crops (blackberry yellow vein, blueberry necrotic ring blotch, funky spot, raspberry crumbly fruit disease, and grape red leaf diseases) and develop management strategies to minimize the impact of these diseases on berry crops. Sub-objective 3a. Sequence novel viruses of small fruit crops and develop assays for their rapid detection. Sub-objective 3b. Characterize natural host range, reservoirs and vectors of these viruses and develop strategies to minimize their impact on production.  Objective 4: Apply thermal-, cryo- and chemotherapy to develop virus-tested planting stocks of berry cultivars for fruit production.  Approach: For each crop, a modified recurrent mass selection system that is very effective for perennial, asexually propagated plants will be followed. Individuals that are selected in a given generation will be intercrossed to produce the next generation. Additional sources of variation (e.g., current cultivars, selections from other breeding programs, or wild selections) will be introduced to the parental pool as needed. Anywhere from 4000-6000 seedlings of Rubus spp. and strawberry, and 3000-4000 blueberry seedlings, all produced from 30-100 crosses, will be evaluated annually. While the primary focus is on cultivars for commercial fruit production, in the process of conducting a breeding program you inevitably identify selections that would be useful for the commercial nursery industry as landscape plants. Since our evaluations system is not geared towards ornamental plants, we try to get these promising selections into commercial nurseries for evaluation. For broadening the germplasm base, superior individuals or representatives of superior populations of small fruit species will be crossed among themselves or with advanced selections or cultivars. Selections from these crosses will be used in our breeding program and distributed to other breeders. Emphasis will be on aphid resistance, disease resistance, fruit quality, thornlessness and tolerance to abiotic stresses associated with climate change.  Viruses that have significant impact on yield and fruit quality will be sequenced using dsRNAs, small RNAs or Rolling Circle Amplification products as template for sequencing using Nexgen sequencing.

       " 'Objective(s): The mission of the National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Citrus and Dates (NCGRCD), Riverside, CA is to access, maintain, preserve, evaluate, and distribute germplasm of Citrus and date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and their wild relatives. In addition, research is conducted to enhance the viability and impact of the collections.  A major focus of research is to reduce vulnerability of citrus and date palm genetic resources to natural disasters and virulent pathogens by devising cryopreservation methods for in vitro preservation and by developing more effective and efficient disease diagnostic procedures.  This project’s comprehensive and coordinated genetic resource management efforts will result in ready access to pathogen-tested/pathogen-free propagative and breeding materials for citrus and date palm breeders, research scientists, and producers.  Associated information will be made available to customers through the Genetic Resources Information Network, stakeholder meetings, and publications.  The specific objectives are:  1)  Develop and apply new methods for conserving and propagating citrus and date genetic resources which improve genebank operating efficiency and effectiveness and which enable pathogen-tested materials and associated information to be distributed worldwide.    1A)  Efficiently and effectively maintain the National Plant Germplasm System collections of citrus and date palm genetic resources and associated information.  Distribute accessions upon request to researchers and breeders world-wide.    1B)  Develop and apply cryopreservation, in cooperative research with the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, Ft. Collins, as an alternate and efficient means of conserving and distributing citrus, citrus wild relatives, and date palm.    1C)  Develop, validate, and apply alternative means, such as cryotherapy, to free citrus germplasm from graft transmissible pathogens.  2)  Elucidate patterns of genetic divergence and d  Approach: New accessions will be acquired through exchange with university breeders, foreign country national programs, botanical gardens, or by plant exploration.  New citrus accessions are released from quarantine following comprehensive testing on indicator plants and laboratory tests as required by CDFA and USDA APHIS, to ensure that graft-transmissible pathogens are no longer present. While citrus and date accessions have traditionally been maintained as living plants, methods for cryopreservation will be developed and applied to the 450 accessions held in the citrus protected collection which is used for distribution of budwood.  For release from quarantine and before citrus accessions may be distributed, the accessions must be cleaned of graft transmissible pathogens.  While the clean-up has traditionally been done by heat treatment or shoot tip grafting, recent research has shown that cryotherapy may be a more efficient method of eliminating graft transmissible pathogens from citrus.  The protocols for cryotherapy will be further developed, standardized, and the efficiency of cleaning graft transmissible pathogens by shoot tip grafting and cryotherapy will be compared.  In previous studies, the single nucleotide polymorphism of a specific nuclear gene, malate dehydrogenase, has been identified as informative to determine phylogenetic relationships among citrus accessions.  This information will be utilized to develop a DNA barcode, based on parsimony-informative characters, to help identify citrus and related genera from the sub-family Aurantioideae.  Huanglongbing (HLB) and other invasive diseases threaten germplasm held under unprotected conditions.  In Florida where HLB is now endemic and in California where HLB threatens to become established, and other citrus producing states as needed; rare germplasm which is not already backed up elsewhere will be recovered, cleaned, and added to the protected collection following release from quarantine status for distribution upon request.  Threatened germplasm will be identified by collaboration with stakeholders.  Diverse citrus and citrus relative germplasm will be planted into the field in Florida for screening for tolerance/resistance to HLB and the psyllid vector of HLB.  Half of the trees planted in the randomized complete block trial will be inoculated with HLB prior to planting in the field.  The plants will be evaluated for HLB, citrus canker, incidence of Diaphorina citri, the psyllid vector of HLB, and other diseases at six month intervals over four years.  High through-put methods of nucleic acid extraction will be coupled with high through-put (384-well) qPCR assays to lower the cost per test and to be able to test for multiple pathogens (both RNA and DNA genome pathogens) from one collection/sample using the Taqman™ probes.  Taqman™ probes will be developed for the RNA transcripts of the housekeeping gene NADH dehydrogenase (NAD5) gene and for the DNA gene of NAD5 for use as an internal control to monitor the quality of RNA and DNA extractions, respectively.',\n",

       " 'Objective(s): Objectives of this research project are:(1) Efficiently and effectively conserve, backup, regenerate and evaluate tropical/subtropical fruit and nut genetic resources and distribute samples and associated information worldwide; (2) Strategically expand and improve current tropical/subtropical fruit and nut germplasm collections through international exchanges; (3) Strengthen the genebank’s genetic marker analytical capacity to minimize inefficiencies in sample handling and to contribute more extensively to the multi-site NPGS tropical/subtropical crop genetic characterization program; and (4) Develop a “quarantine-safe” germplasm transfer system modeled after the ongoing transfer and back-up of the NPGS avocado collection in Miami to the NPGS genebank in Hilo as a means of protecting it from laurel wilt disease.  Approach: 1) The curator and five staff continue management of the 14 designated clonal germplasm collections (app 1000 accessions) in 33 field acres, greenhouse & a tissue culture laboratory.  C. papaya and Vasconcellea spp. seeds are regenerated every 4 years in PRSV-free fields and in greenhouses using controlled pollination. Cleaned seeds are stored at 4 C and storage units monitored electronically via a security company. A senior staff and the curator are on call for temperature alarm calls. Descriptors will be collected on plant and fruit morphologies and stored in a local database. Passport, inventory and descriptors information are periodically loaded onto the Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN).

       " 'Animal loss: We lost Cre transgenic reporter fish lines (tcf21:CreERT2, VE-Cdh:Cre, nkx2.5:Cre) that we had obtained from other labs and that were housed in our quarantine room. We need the Cre lines to assess how faithful our ubb-nucSwitch transgenic fish line will report Cre activity in different tissues (Aim 2.3). We also lost juvenile zebrafish injected with the hsp70 locus containing 110 kb BAC transgene that were housed in the main fish facility. We need these fish to determine the efficiency of tol2-mediated BAC transgenesis for BACs spanning about 100 kb of genomic DNA (Aim 2.2). Establishing a line obtained from another lab in our own facility takes 6 to 8 months (two fish generations). Testing transgenic DNA constructs for germline transmission takes about 3 to 5 month. We therefore estimate the time lost to be between 6 to 8 months. Restoration of lost animals: We have asked the labs that generated the Cre transgenic reporter fish lines to send us the lines again. We estimated that we have these fish in our main facility at breeding age by October 2013. We have re-injected the hsp70 locus containing 110 kb BAC transgene and estimate to start screening for transgenic founder fish in June 2013 and finish the assessment of the rate of transgenesis by August 2013. Reagent loss: We lost the ubb BAC in the sw105 recombineering strain due to fridge and freezer power outage. This strain is needed to modify the ubb BAC to generate the ubbnucSwitch Cre reporter transgene (Aim 2.2). The generation and test of BAC transformants takes about a month. Restoration of lost reagents: We have re-transformed the ubb BAC into the sw105 recombineering strain and confirmed the transformants. Time loss: We lost time due to lab closure and recovery efforts, which totals about three months. Additionally, we lack a quarantine room to import fish and are experiencing lower fecundity of adult fish and lower survival rate of baby fish in our main fish facility.',\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duke University is committed to scientific research and its translation to improve human health, including appropriate use of animals in research. The purpose of this proposal is to replace and relocate an aged autoclave located within Duke's Central Vivarium and reallocate space to optimally provide defined quarantine/isolation and animal receiving areas, and to provide the ability to decontaminate suspect caging and equipment from satellite areas. Eighty eight per cent of all mice and rats on campus are housed in barrier areas or facilities that are specifically designed to preclude entry and spread of adventitious agents that may negatively influence research objectives, and non-rodent animals are localized primarily within the Central Vivarium. The specific aims of this proposal essentially impact all animal researchers at Duke through the quarantine and isolation of 'suspect' animals and the minimizing of cross- contamination potential of infectious animals. Funds from this renovation grant are crucial to: a) replacing a 43-year- old autoclave that is necessary for maintenance of housing for isolation and quarantine in the Central Vivarium as well as for decontamination of caging and equipment from satellite facilities when rodent infectious disease outbreaks occur and b) to provide a quarantine/isolation area that is separate from the general animal housing area. Direct costs from the National Institutes of Health provide about $120 million of funding annually to animal research at Duke. Opened in 1973, the Central Vivarium is the main campus vivarium and remains structurally and operationally sound. This 29,129 net square feet (nsf) facility is arranged on two floors: a small ground floor area houses administrative and diagnostic laboratory space, with animal space located on the first floor. The Central Vivarium can house any laboratory animal species in Duke's program and is the main site for housing and use of USDA-regulated species, including non-human primates, canines, and agricultural species. Caging and equipment are processed in the Central Vivarium cagewash area on the north side of the facility and in a single corridor operation: soiled caging and equipment are removed from the animal rooms and transported into the  dirty side  of cagewash via a single corridor, clean caging and equipment exit mechanical washers directly into the clean side of cagewash. Construction funded through C06 grants from the NIH utilizing American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) resources is underway to build 2,731 nsf to meet the needs of biomedical engineering researchers that require specialized procedural areas and large animal models as well as a two-story addition to the Central Vivarium of about 19,000 nsf. The latter project will provide housing and procedural space for USDA-regulated species (e.g., nonhuman primates, agricultural and companion species) to accommodate the growth Duke is experiencing in neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgical, biomedical engineering, and translational research. The Central Vivarium also supports a number of rodent satellite facilities that lack the ability to sanitize caging and equipment as well as autoclaving of these items. Caging and equipment from these facilities are transported to the Central Vivarium for decontamination via the sterilizer and subsequent sanitation in the cagewash area. The acquisition and relocation of a new sterilizer, along with refurbishment of an area for quarantine/isolation will improve decontamination of materials, reduce the chance of adventitious agent outbreaks, and enhance the connections of the original Central Vivarium to the C06 grant-funded Central Vivarium additions currently underway.\",\n",
       " 'Autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s Disease (ADAD) represents a small fraction (<1%) of all Alzheimer’s Disease cases, but it presents a unique window into the disease. Because individuals possessing known ADADcausing mutations are destined to develop the disease at an early and relatively predictable age, they can be studied from an asymptomatic stage and the progression of the disease can be observed. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DIAN) will continue its study of ADAD in a systematic and comprehensive manner, acquiring biochemical, neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical measures from individuals from families with known ADAD mutations. The Informatics Core will be responsible for managing all of the data acquired within DIAN, except for mutation status. A centralized database – the Central Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA) – will be deployed to store and make data available to investigators in a user-friendly manner. Data will be acquired at the performance sites and uploaded into the CNDA. Once uploaded, the data will reside in quarantine until passing several rounds of quality control checks to identify missing fields, outliers, and other discrepancies. Imaging data will be distributed to dedicated quality control sites for systematic post-processing and inspection. Once released from quarantine, the data will be made available to DIAN investigators via a data freeze produced and carefully orchestrated with the Biostatistics Core. Participant privacy and overall system security will be addressed with the utmost attention in all aspects of the Core’s infrastructure. The Informatics Core will maintain close interactions with each of the other cores. Regular reports will be prepared with the Biostatistics Core and presented to the Administration Core and Steering Committee. Support for the Imaging Core will include image upload/download tools, image file de-identification procedures, exchange with quality control sites, and implementation of automated processing and analysis workflows.

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular evolution of primate DNA double-strand break repair genes will be studied. These genes are important for genome stability, and many cancer syndromes have been linked to mutations in these genes. Interestingly, many members of this gene family bear signatures of recurrent positive selection. The hypothesis being tested is that these signatures result from the long-term co-evolution between these DNA repair genes and the pervasive, parasitic retroviruses and retrotransposons with which primates have evolved. This may have influenced primate DNA repair genes with respect to both polymorphic and fixed genetic variation. In this proposed research, large primate sequence datasets will be generated for genes involved in human double-strand break repair, and these will be tested for signatures of recurrent positive selection. Retroviral infection assays will then be used to test whether adaptive sequence change in these DNA repair genes has resulted in altered susceptibility to infection. The consequences of this sequence change to cellular DNA repair will also be explored. Preliminary data in a cell culture model system shows that one of the most well-known cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, may be evolving under the dual selective pressures of DNA repair fidelity and retroviral resistance. Based on this, DNA repair gene evolution can have a profound effect on cancer, and for this reason, it is of great importance that the evolutionary forces that define the evolution of these genes be elucidated. This proposed research is central to the overarching goal of understanding how genetic parasites, through the selective pressures that they exert, shape the sequence of human genes with which they interact.',\n",

However, questions were voiced in two areas: 1) the interim status of the renovation and facility management staffing (the overall summary commented that  a degree of uncertainty remains with the Rodent Models Core, since the person who will manage the core has not yet been hired, and the facility is not yet completed') and 2) the prediction that we would have difficulty hiring a PhD level staff member for the behavioral testing service and the mistaken impression that only two investigators would actually make use of the behavioral facility. Five years later, we believe we have successfully met all of our milestones. The renovation was completed with creation of a dedicated suite for behavioral testing, acquisition of major equipment, and upgrade of infrastructure, transforming the RMC into a barrier facility. All staff, including the facility manager and PhD level psychologist for the Behavioral Testing Suite, were hired, trained, and are now stable members of the Waisman IDDRC core staff. The RMC is now an outstanding resource that is central to the scientific programs of 16 IDDRC investigators.\",\n",
       " \"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek funds to renovate and expand the Centralized Zebrafish Animal Resource (CZAR), the Core Facility for Zebrafish Research at the University of Utah (U of U). Research with zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a significant focus of biomedical research at the U of U. Our investigators use this model organism to uncover mechanisms responsible for heart disease, cancers, muscular dystrophies, response to pathogens, development of the nervous system, and other medically important conditions. More than 20 faculty members from eight Departments currently use the CZAR. Research performed in the CZAR has been supported by major biomedical funding agencies, including NIH, HHMI, ACS, AHA, MDA, and March of Dimes, and is currently supported by ~$7,800,000 in annual direct cost funding from grants. Pending grant applications (as of July, 2013) request an additional ~$2,000,000 in annual direct cost funding. Research performed in the CZAR has been published in top-tier biomedical journals, including (past 5-6 years) Science, Nature, Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Methods, Neuron, Cell Metabolism, Developmental Cell, PNAS (USA), PLoS Genetics, Genes & Development, and Development. Thus, the facility we seek to expand facilitates cutting edge biomedical research and plays a highly significant role in supporting biomedical research at the U of U. The CZAR was established in 2001 with matching funds from the U of U and the NIH through the G20 funding mechanism. It was designed to support the research programs of five early-to-mid-career investigators. In a bold and innovative move, in 2002 the CZAR became an open-access shared-use Core Facility serving the entire U of U community, receiving yearly operational support and periodic instrumentation funds from the U of U. In addition to animal housing, care, and uniform oversight, as a Core Facility the CZAR provides: 1) space and equipment for experimental procedures; 2) teaching and expertise; 3) access to sophisticated technologies; and 4) opportunities for collaborations among multiple research groups. As best we know, the CZAR was the first University Core Facility for Zebrafish Research in the US. The Core has attracted many established researchers at the U of U to begin working with the zebrafish and has become the basis of our ability to recruit many junior zebrafish investigators to the Health Sciences Center at the U of U (five new faculty in the past four years). The CZAR is in desperate need of expansion. More than 80 researchers of all levels currently utilize the Core, which has been operating at 90+% housing capacity for the past 5 years. Newly recruited faculty, recently awarded grants from the NIH  Programs to Enhance Zebrafish Research  (PAR-11-130 and -131), and the  Director's New Innovator Award Program  (RFA-RM-12-016) funded to generate new mutants and transgenic lines for use by the worldwide zebrafish research community, and new research opportunities afforded by the gene knock-out and gene-targeting technologies recently developed at the U of U require increased housing and experimental space in the CZAR. The current CZAR comprises 3646 sq ft; it contains 70 6- shelf 60  racks (5040 3-liter tanks) for standard housing of zebrafish, and one rack for holding animals in quarantine. The proposed $1,129,380 project will expand the capacity of the CZAR by over 50%. We request $500,000 from the NIH; the rest will be provided by the U of U. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Renovate 1,923 sq ft of existing building space that is immediately adjacent to the current CZAR to expand the current CZAR; 2) Purchase and install 36 new 6-shelf 60  racks and thus increase zebrafish the housing capacity in the CZAR by 51%; 3) Double our quarantine capacity; and 4) Create new experimental procedure areas, including a room for off-cycle production of eggs. The project addresses several objectives of the FOA. It efficiently accommodates demonstrated needs for conducting PHS-funded biomedical research. Because it functions as a shared-use Core Facility, the facility can be used efficiently to accommodate the changing needs of individual research projects. By expanding zebrafish housing capacity at the U of U within the purview of the current CZAR Core Facility, which is operated under the supervision of a full-time, highly experienced profession staff, the project guarantees the highest quality of care to animals and rigorous compliance with USDA Animal Welfare Act and the DHHS policies related to the care and use of laboratory animals. Finally, the proposed renovation project has employed sustainable design technologies and design approaches throughout.\",\n",
       " 'AbstractBehavioral and physiological responses to psychosocial stressors can predict the long-term healthconsequences of exposure to stress. These consequences include dramatically elevated risks forcardiometabolic diseases, addictions, and mental disorders. Little is known, however, about either the geneticvariation underlying inter-individual variation in susceptibility to stress, or about the gene expression patternsthat provide the presumed mechanism for such variation. We propose to create, using the Caribbean vervetmonkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus), a translational non-human primate (NHP) model for stressresponsivity studies, which will facilitate investigations of the multi-system effects of an acute psychosocialstressor on physiology, behavior and cognition. These investigations are not feasible in humans, and cannotbe reliably modeled in rodents, which differ from humans too substantially in these systems. We will leveragethe short-term quarantine procedures applied routinely to wild-trapped vervets on the island of St. Kitts toinvestigate multi-system measures hypothesized to be associated with stress-responsivity. Specifically, we willlongitudinally monitor expression of genes and gene networks that are stress-regulated and that predictindividual differences in behavioral and physiological sensitivity to stress. This proof of concept study willvalidate the proposed model by: 1) demonstrating the impact of the stressor on metabolic, inflammatory andbehavioral responses; 2) characterizing inter-individual variations in stress-related traits; 3) showingmechanistic links between stress-induced changes in higher-order phenotypes and gene expression patterns.Development of this model will, in the short-term provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of stress-related diseases, and, in the long-term, pave the way for large scale genetic and genomic investigations toidentify the basis for individual differences in response to stress.',\n",

       " \"Coral reefs provide crucial services for people and are becoming increasingly threatened by climate change. But many important questions about coral reefs remain unanswered, such as how their incredibly high biodiversity has developed and is maintained. It is well known that reef-forming corals consist of many different groups of bacteria and algae that live in the tissues of corals, but the function of most of these microbes remain unknown. One of the reported microbial functions is the process called nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is better known as a very important process on land. For example, alfalfa in agricultural fields has microbes associated with its roots that can capture nitrogen from the air and replace nitrogen lost from soils in water. The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is less well known, especially in tropical waters where nitrogen levels are low, although nitrogen in coral reef systems is known to derive mainly from nitrogen fixation. Recently nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been discovered in the tissues of corals, which begs the overarching question of this project: how important is the contribution of this fixed nitrogen to corals and to the surrounding environment? This research will integrate with an educational program that fosters critical thinking and cooperative learning among participants by involving undergraduate students who will work closely with the scientists. Students from underrepresented backgrounds will be recruited; the undergraduates will become part of an existing undergraduate research opportunities program where they receive mentoring, financial support, and intensive writing support while conducting original research projects of their own. Also a new program will be developed with the university's veterans office to attract and transition veterans into science fields across campus. Finally, outreach activities will be organized at local public high schools, and some public environmental education lectures about the ecology and biology of coral reefs are planned.Significant gaps in understanding exist about the role of prokaryotes in the physiology, biochemistry and ecology of reef-forming corals. This project will assess how different prokaryotic communities affect the biogeochemistry of nitrogen, specifically nitrogen fixation, within the coral holobiont and how nitrogen fixation contributes to the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content of excreted mucus. The introduction of  new nitrogen  though nitrogen fixation and release of DON could have significant impacts on the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in the adjacent benthic communities surrounding corals. High throughput sequencing tools will be used to quantify the taxonomic and functional diversity of these symbioses in corals from the Pacific and Caribbean, as well as the taxonomic diversity of nifH genes in the tissues of corals. Rates of nitrogen fixation on several coral species from Australia, Hawaii and Curacao will be measured, along with the translocation of fixed nitrogen to all compartments of the coral holobiont, and the contribution of  new nitrogen  to the DON of mucus released to the environment determined. The results will increase our understanding of the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of symbiotic prokaryotes in corals. This project will also help guide future studies on the biogeochemical cycling of coral-derived nitrogen on coral reefs.\",\n",

       " \"The longitudinal arch is considered to be a unique adaptation of the human foot that is crucial for proper foot function. During bipedal walking, the arch supports the weight of the body and transforms the foot into a propulsive lever. Human arch height varies, however, along a continuum from flat to very arched (often asymptomatically), which questions the notion that a well-developed arch is essential for healthy foot function. Our understanding of this variation is incomplete; more specifically, research is lacking in appreciation for the degree to which variation in foot bones contributes to variation in arch height, as well as how the arch structure seen in modern humans reflects the course of human evolutionary history. This dissertation project by doctoral student Amber Heard-Booth (under the supervision of Dr. Liza Shapiro, University of Texas at Austin) aims to improve our knowledge of the evolutionary history of the longitudinal arch so that we may more thoroughly understand the basis for its variation among modern humans. The research will 1) identify foot bone features that directly contribute to longitudinal arch height; 2) link these bony features to the way in which the foot supports body weight (plantar pressure); and 3) use this information to estimate arch height and reconstruct foot loading from the foot fossils of hominins (i.e., bipedal human ancestors). The relationship between foot bones, arch height, and plantar pressure will be assessed by studying both foot bone development in archaeological samples and the development of the arch in living children; as such, it represents the first to take an ontogenetic perspective and to fully utilize a sample of human feet known to vary in arch height. The relationship among these variables also will be investigated in an adult sample of humans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and plantar pressure data. By contributing knowledge on the relationship between foot bone form and function in developing and adult human feet, this project will inform clinicians' understanding of the range of variation in arch development, which may help assess need for orthotics, while understanding how variation in arch height is linked to plantar pressure will help clinicians choose interventions to prevent pressure-related injuries. The research also fosters scientific education through provision of research opportunities to students at The University of Texas, especially through engagement with an internship program that targets first-generation undergraduates.\",\n",
       " 'This project will investigate how environmental factors and wildlife management programs affect infectious disease spread in species that move large distances. The researchers will evaluate populations of pumas in the Florida Everglades, Colorado?s Front Range and Western Slope, and Southern California. The results will be applicable to other wide-ranging species, such as large herbivores, other carnivores, and even humans. Working with partners in state and Federal agencies, the investigators will determine how the spread of disease is affected by management actions such as hunting and relocation of animals; how future disease outbreaks might spread through vulnerable populations; and how they might be controlled via vaccination, development of quarantine buffer zones, or other means. The project also includes outreach efforts to educate the public about conservation issues, and engage students in relevant studies in disease ecology. This project will involve students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. The study will evaluate how the interaction between landscape structure and management interventions affect disease spread in populations of wide-ranging apex predators (Puma concolor). Using an exceptional database and corresponding set of biological samples, and an experienced collaborative team, the research will trace the spread of two apathogenic (i.e. non-pathogenic), contact-dependent retroviral agents in geographically distinct puma populations under three different management regimes: (a) supplementation and recovery of the highly endangered Florida panther, (b) large-scale manipulative harvest experiments of a rural Colorado puma population, and (c) steady-state management of urban puma populations in the Colorado Front Range and Southern California. A landscape genomics approach will inform advanced network models to determine the relative importance of landscape structure and management actions on host connectivity, demography, and, ultimately, disease dynamics. These apathogenic transmission models will be tested with empirical data from a recent virulent outbreak of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) in Florida Panthers. The model will be used to predict disease spread of virulent agents using models based on apathogenic agents, and to inform management programs to control disease outbreaks. This integrated approach provides a basis for utilizing complex molecular and geospatial tools to advance models to predict and mitigate virulent disease outbreaks for wide-ranging species in complex landscapes.',\n",
       " \"NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components to prepare young scientists for careers in emerging areas where biology intersects with other scientific disciplines, in this case with mathematics and physical sciences.  The Fellows are expected to lead the nation's scientific workforce of the future. This fellowship to Sarah Collins examines how local and regional factors interact to influence lake nutrient chemistry. The host institution is Michigan State University, and the sponsoring scientists are Patricia Soranno and Pang-Ning Tan. Lake ecosystems provide many valuable services to society including commercial navigation and water for drinking, irrigation, and recreation as well as economically and recreationally important fisheries.  Understanding how human activities alter these important ecosystems is complex and requires consideration of processes that occur at multiple scales.  One common driver of environmental change is human alteration of nutrient cycles, known to have profoundly affected ecosystems around the globe.   The research investigates how regional patterns in atmospheric nitrogen deposition influence nutrient limitation in lake ecosystems and uses a recently assembled, uniquely extensive database that includes water chemistry records for over 60,000 lakes, data on nitrogen deposition, and local variables, including watershed land use and connectivity between aquatic systems.  The extensive nature of the database makes possible an explanation of how specific local drivers mediate the regional effects of nitrogen deposition on nutrient chemistry in lakes.  Training goals for the Fellow include mathematical analysis techniques, data mining, statistical modeling, and the use of large databases to study nutrient pollution across spatial and temporal scales as well as teaching a limnology course to undergraduates in an innovative, interactive classroom setting.\",\n",
       " 'Coastal environments today are receiving unprecedented amounts of nitrogen, an important nutrient that, in excess, results in nuisance algal blooms, oxygen deficiency, and fisheries collapse. Mitigation efforts will depend on an understanding of the natural pathways by which nitrogen is removed. This research will examine the environmental conditions that control two microbial nitrogen removal processes, denitrification and anammox. There are still many uncertainties concerning the environmental factors that control these processes in coastal ecosystems, as the anammox process has only recently been discovered and hypothesized to rival denitrification in its removal of nitrogen. These uncertainties will be addressed through a series of environmental monitoring and tracer experiments conducted in seagrass sediments in Australia. This work will be accomplished in collaboration with Dr. Dirk Erler, an expert in the field of coastal nitrogen cycling with access to unique analytical equipment and field sites at Southern Cross University.In particular, this research will investigate (a) the environmental conditions conducive for the production of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, in systems where denitrification and anammox co-occur and (b) the role of organic carbon in determining the contributions of anammox and denitrification to nitrogen removal. Chambers will be installed on sediments in seagrass beds to enable in situ monitoring of denitrification, anammox, and nitrous oxide production rates. Isotopic tracers will be added to the incubations to track the formation of end products of nitrogen cycling processes by mass spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. These sediments will also be analyzed for a suite of environmental parameters that can be examined as possible controlling factors. Very little nitrogen cycling research has been conducted in seagrass ecosystems, so this study will provide novel insights into nitrogen removal processes and greenhouse gas production in this environment. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.',\n",
       " 'Coral reefs have profound ecological and economical importance but face environmental challenges, including seawater temperature rises, ocean acidification, and ultraviolet radiation. Corals exist in a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae. Understanding how this symbiosis protects the system from heavy metals could simultaneously address one of the most important questions in environmental biology, namely, how organisms maintain homeostasis in changing environments. This project will investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying coral symbiosis, using genomic information from both coral host and algae symbiont. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Nori Satoh, professor of the Marine Genomics Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology. This collaboration will allow a unique opportunity to access cutting-edge expertise and data: The lab recently decoded the genome of Acropora digitifera, a coral that is one of the most sensitive to environmental changes, and also produced the first draft assembly of a dinoflagellate, Symbiodinium minitum, nuclear genome.Of the environmental challenges coral reefs face, heavy metal exposure may be one of the least studied. The lab recently identified candidate genes for eight members of metal-complexing proteins in A. digitifera, although they did not determine a homolog of the metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF1) gene, despite its cited significant role in metal detoxification in other marine biology. The proposed project will analyze the genome of S. minitum to determine candidate genes for metal-complexing proteins, particularly the MTF1 gene that was not present in A. digitifera. Candidate genes could provide preliminary evidence that their byproducts may be symbiotically used by the coral, which apparently cannot produce certain metal-complexing proteins on its own.',\n",
       " 'Salt marshes have received a great deal of attention recently because they provide a number of essential ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and nitrogen removal. Strong interest in marshes as carbon sinks is likely to spur new programs to offset carbon emissions by restoring degraded wetlands, raising a host of questions concerning whether marsh restorations can successfully rehabilitate other ecosystem functions.  A key ecosystem functions of salt marshes is their ability to remove biologically available nitrogen through a microbial process known as denitrification.  Biologically available nitrogen is entering coastal ecosystems at increasing rates as a result of human activities such as application of fertilizers and combustion of fossil fuels. When this nitrogen makes its way to coastal waters it can result in a host of negative environmental effects associated with eutrophication, including increasing areas of low oxygen water known as coastal dead zones.  The microbes living in salt marshes are able to remove portions of this excess biologically available nitrogen by converting it back to nitrogen gas, suggesting a benefit of salt marsh restoration, however, more information is needed regarding how these microbes may respond to environmental changes associated with restoration.  This study will provide new insight on how restoration of a New England salt marsh will alter the capacity of the marsh to remove biologically available nitrogen and will increase understanding of the physiology of the microbes that underlie this critical biogeochemical pathway through a combination of in situ rate measurements, environmental metagenomics, and whole genome sequencing. The results of this research will provide important new information to restoration practitioners on the conditions that are mostly likely to successfully restore the denitrification capacity of degraded salt marshes so that they reach parity with undisturbed marshes.  This work will also enhance scientific infrastructure and knowledge transfer through two mechanisms.  First, it will train one early career female scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and two graduate students.  Second, research on the denitrification capacity of salt marshes will be incorporated into a First Year Seminar for undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the only public university in the city, which serves a large minority and first generation college student population.  This seminar program is designed to increase retention of at risk biology majors by engaging them in research experiences in the early days of their college career. Through collaborations with the Massachusetts Department of Ecological Restoration, the students will meet with stakeholders, design and carry out research in recently restored marshes in the greater Boston area, and report their findings back to the stakeholders. This community-engaged scholarship provides a unique mechanism to disseminate information to stakeholders and it engages students in the scientific process in a way that promotes accountability, generates higher quality outcomes and excites them about the field of ecology.',\n",
       " 'In the oceans, the amount of organic nitrogen is in great part controlled by the balance between two microbially-controlled pathways: Denitrification, the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, and nitrogen fixation, the reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonium. Because the large spatial variability of nitrogen fixation is difficult to resolve with current measurements, the development of new methods for high resolution measurements is highly desirable. In order to characterize the geographical distribution of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates and ultimately yield better estimates of new nitrogen, researchers at Duke University will develop a novel method for in situ measurements of nitrogen fixation. By providing insights into the biogeography of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates, this method and ensuing observations will fill a gap in the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms governing the biogeochemistry of new nitrogen in oceanic environments, and ultimately aid in the refinement of oceanic ecosystem models for current and future climate.Broader Impacts: Through a partnership with the Museum of Life and Science, the project will provide a platform to foster climate and climate change literacy well beyond the duration of the proposed work. In addition, Informal Science Education educators will participate in research to further their scientific knowledge, and educate student researchers on effective strategies to communicate science.

       " '1351676LiMany people have become aware of the issue of pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater and natural waters. With the pharmaceutical market worldwide estimated to be $1 trillion dollars in 2015 and with an aging population (which uses more pharmaceuticals) and water and wastewater treatment plants never designed to deal with extremely low concentrations of highly biologically active compounds, the problem will likely get worse.  One of the biggest, yet very subtle is the issue of antibiotic resistance in bacteria in natural waters.Antibiotic resistance constitutes a national and global public health threat. Evidence suggests that in addition to coming from hospitals, antibiotic resistant bacteria also emerge in the environment due to prolonged exposure to antibiotics originating in livestock and human wastes. On the other hand, many antibiotic resistant bacteria can subsist on antibiotics by using them as carbon and energy sources. Because nutrients influence microbial metabolisms and vary in quantity and composition across environmental compartments, they represent an important environmental factor that can affect antibiotic resistance and antibiotic subsistence in the environment.  However, how nutrients affect the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of antibiotic subsistence in microbial communities is poorly understood. The overall goal of this project is to build an integrated research and education/outreach program to minimize the negative impacts of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to environmental and public health. The research goal of the project is to understand the interactions between antibiotics and microbial (bacterial) communities under various nutrient levels and types (i.e., labile vs. recalcitrant). The research approach will investigate the responses of bacteria to both nutrient starvation and antibiotic presence. The results of these studies will allow implementation in municipal and agricultural wastewater treatment to control the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The proposed project will use a novel analytical tool, quantitative (meta)proteomics, which can offer new and valuable perspectives to environmental engineering studies. The use of quantitative (meta)proteomics in the mechanistic studies on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic subsistence will lay the groundwork for exploring further application of this novel technology in other environmental engineering fields such as exposure and biodegradation studies.One major source of antibiotics in the environment is livestock manure. The education goal of the project is to promote behavioral changes in livestock producers on antibiotic administration and manure management and to educate a new generation of environmental engineers specializing in solving agriculture-related environmental challenges. This will be accomplished by:1.) Raising the awareness of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as environmental contaminants among livestock producers through outreach and education activities2.) Develop an integrated course module to stimulate interest in environmental science among high school students in rural areas, and,3.) Encourage rural students to pursue a graduate degree in environmental engineering',\n",
       " 'Weather-driven pest and crop models are used increasingly for whole-farm planning as well as for specific crop and pest management decision making needs. Temperature and rainfall can explain much of the year-to-year variability in the the timing of pest occurrence and outbreaks, and models have become essential tools to make predictions in order to follow through with informed management actions. Currently most pest modeling systems make use of up to a 7-day weather forecast, if any at all, to make future predictions. Beyond that, the models have typically used 30-year average weather, which in the face of rapidly changing climate, often provides a less useful prediction than other options. In fact the National Weather Service (NWS) has longer term weather and climate models that currently are relied upon for mostly qualitative guidance in many realms including agriculture. These NWS and similar forecasts have increasingly shown more skill (i. e. better performance vs. 30-year normals), as weather models and expertise in their application have improved in recent decades. We propose a process that will convert the NWS forecasts into quantitative (and thus usable for pest and crop models) data forecasts and link them with over 100 online models already in service for pest and crop management needs for the U.S. This will provide much more useful and skillful predictions for up to 90 days into the future. We will adapt the NWS forecasts into two versions: one version will be designed to help with temperature driven (degree-day) insect and crop development models. A second version will make use of rainfall patterns needed for moisture and temperature-driven plant disease models. We will test this new adaptive technology for several significant pest forecasting problems including the spotted wing Drosophila, which is a new invasive pest of many fruit crops throughout the US, for potato late blight disease forecasting in the Columbia basin of Washington state, and for U.S. mapping of multiple invasive species pest events, used for both integrated pest management and APHIS plant protection and quarantine (PPQ) pest survey programs. Together these applications will be used to test the potential for longer term forecasts and improving precision of models, and for reducing the uncertainty of agricultural decision making. This should lead to more informed, more profitable, and environmentally sound pest control and other farm planning decisions across a broad array of regions and cropping systems, including organic, sustainable and conventional production approaches.',\n",

Also, only two percent of all veterinary medicine students in the United States are African American. In addition, other minorities such as Hispanic account for on overall six percent. This disparity may negatively affect both animal and human health programs because veterinarians and veterinary technologists play key roles in maintaining the health and safety of the public.

       " \"In spring of 2002 a green metallic beetle was discovered killing ash trees in the Detroit, MI area. After consulting with a series of insect taxonomists, it was determined that the species was Agrilus planipennis, a flat-headed wood borer, newly named in this paper as the  Emerald ash borer [EAB].  This species originated from the Soviet Far East and northeastern China, where it is an occasional minor pest of the native ash tree species there. A quarantine was quickly initiated to prevent movement of ash trees and firewood . However, a subsequent dendrochronological analysis indicated that the this species had probably been introduced in the early 1990's. EAB quickly spread to northern Indiana and Ohio with all species of North American ash trees being attacked and killed. With such a large source area, local quarantines were ineffective in preventing spread of the beetle, and the beetle has hop-scotched across the eastern US with infestations being found in 9 states plus Ontario and Quebec in 2009. Their rapid long-range dispersal was attributed to human transport via firewood or nursery stock, which has been complemented by their natural ability to disperse shorter distances by flying. The beetle reached New England this past summer (2012), being found in Connecticut and Massachusetts. It is now known from 18 states, plus Quebec and Ontario, and is now within 150 km of New Hampshire. Regional focus has been on development of surveillance and detection techniques throughout the range of the ash trees so that quarantines may be initiated if EAB is found, with greater success being projected when dealing with much smaller and more manageable populations. Particularly needed are effective protocols for detection of low-density infestations of EAB, and to monitor spread of populations. One approach is to use Cerceris fumipennis (or  the smoky-winged beetle bandit  [SWBB]), a solitary wasp that is a colonial nester in hard-packed sand. This wasp is recognized as presenting an extremely effective technique for sampling the local buprestid fauna, and outperforming the purple prism traps in detecting presence of target buprestid species. A number of colonies have been located in the state, and studies over the past three years supported by the US Forest Service have generated an initial list of prey species for the state. Aspects of the basic biology of the wasp have not been documented for New Hampshire, but a regional need is for greater precision in a determination of the foraging distance of the wasp, which is the ultimate goal of this project, as well as developing baseline information on colony activity, seasonality, and prey preferences in different forest types for New Hampshire. The impact of this study will be to determine the effectiveness of this pest monitoring system, with the goal of being able to detect the appearance of this pest species when its populations are low. If practical, then beetle presence can lead to effective management leading to eradication of the population, preventing death of the ash trees to these beetles\",\n",
       " 'Armored scale insects include many destructive pests of orchard crops, forestry, horticulture, and agriculture, costing an estimated two billion dollars per year in the US. They also have an extraordinary tendency to be invasive. As of 2005, the US had 132 species of armored scale insects introduced from other countries, comprising fully 40% of armored scale species in the US. Most of these (64%) were considered pests. About one new invasive diaspidid species is detected in the US every year. The big problem is that armored scale insects are small, cryptic, and found on almost every kind of fruit and most other plant parts, so they are very prone to be transported unwittingly across borders. A second problem is that even once you find them, they are difficult to identify. They require expert preparation and study. Only adult females can be reliably identified and they need to be mounted on microscope slides. And the third problem is that, even once you get an identification, it may not be accurate. Some pests turn out to consist of complexes of species that can&#39;t be told apart without DNA evidence. For all of these reasons, armored scale insects are top candidates for developing a DNA-based system of identification. Here we propose to capture DNA sequences from armored scale insects intercepted at plant quarantine stations, while carefully identifying each specimen in the traditional way by mounting on a microscope slide. The results -- DNA sequences from well-identified specimens -- will help us develop a DNA-based system of identification, and also contribute to improving our understanding of the history and diversity of armored scale insects and their relationships with their host plants.',\n",
       " 'Plant-parasitic nematodes are a major threat to sustainable crop production in the United States. Potatoes rank as one of the four most important staple crops on a global scale and nematodes are one of the most important pathogen groups for this crop. Washington and Idaho produce 60-70% of the total potato yield in the United States. However, the major potato-producing regions in these states are widely infested with the Columbia root-knot nematode (CRKN), Meloidogyne chitwoodi. CRKN infection of potatoes causes severe quality defects on the tuber surface and can render entire shipments unmarketable, thereby inflicting massive economic losses to producers and rural economies. In addition, CRKN is a highly regulated quarantine pest. Current nematode control efforts are based on applying synthetic nematicides that are potentially harmful for the environment, costly and faced with increasing regulation. An ideal nematode control solution would be to cultivate resistant plants. However, CRKN isolates are known that overcome resistant potatoes, thereby complicating breeding efforts.This project will analyze the variability of diverse CRKN isolates to gain a better understanding of CRKN populations that are able to overcome plant resistance. CRKN morphology and genetic traits will be analyzed and compared between virulent and avirulent isolates. This is important because once a better understanding of CRKN variability is achieved, potato breeding efforts can be based on a more secure footing and take the whole range of nematode variability into account when screening for new sources of resistance. This would achieve the overall goal of this project, which is to develop novel sources of CRKN resistance that are stable, thereby reducing the need for synthetic pesticides to control CRKN in potato.',\n",

       " 'The Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA supports one of the most abundant and diverse vegetable seed crop industries in the world. Of &gt;50 types of vegetable seed crops grown in the PNW, at least 35 are for small-seeded vegetables. PNW seed crops produce 50% or more of the Brussels sprout, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, radish, red beet, and spinach seed used in the USA, and 20-50% of the world supply depending on the species. Production of seed crops requires rigorous management practices to achieve the high standards of purity, germination, and freedom from seedborne pathogens necessitated by the global seed industry. Seedborne pathogens can cause economic losses for growers, are a liability for seed companies, and can disseminate pathogens into new areas or introduce different strains or races of pathogens into new regions. Seed crops also can be affected by pathogens that are not necessarily seedborne but can have a significant impact on seed yield and quality. Therefore, effective disease management remains a necessity for survival of a high quality seed industry in the PNW. A diversity of field, greenhouse, and lab research trials will be carried out on the primary diseases of concern for carrot seed crops (bacterial blight and powdery mildew, in particular), onion crops (particularly soilborne diseases as affected by soil fumigation practices common in central Washington), and spinach seed crops (Fusarium and Verticillium wilts, and two Phomopsis species of quarantine status that have impacted spinach seed trade significantly). In addition, the ability to work effectively with vegetable seed growers in the PNW on disease management will entail continued vigilance in monitoring the diseases of primary concern, as well as other diseases and new diseases that might become established on these crops, and how changes in production practices and seed industry policies impact the diseases; as well as continued research on identifying potential improvements in the efficacy, sustainability, and economic viability of disease management programs for the diversity of crops and diseases that affect these crops. Results will be presented at annual grower meetings, field days, conferences, and workshops, and published in relevant scientific journals, technical publications, and extension bulletins as well as the PNW Vegetable Extension Group (VEG) web site (http://mtvernon.wsu.edu/path_team/vegpath_team.htm). Information generated by this proposed research will be used to develop or refine regional IPM programs for diseases of small-seeded vegetable seed crops in the PNW. Identification of sources of inoculum, survival, means of dissemination, potential sources of resistance, and yield losses caused by the key pathogens will assist with implementing appropriate cultural, chemical, and other practices to reduce disease impacts. The carrot bacterial blight and powdery mildew resistance screening work is expected to increase our understanding of the nature of inheritance of different sources of resistance to these two diseases, assist breeders with incorporating resistance into carrot parent lines, commercial hybrids, and/or open pollinated lines, and provide growers with more carrot cultivars with resistance (ideally a greater level of resistance) to bacterial blight or powdery mildew than currently available. This should reduce bactericide and fungicide use, and the impacts of these diseases on carrot crops. Registration of fungicides or bactericides with greater efficacy, and optimizing the use of such products may reduce the number of applications needed for effective control of some diseases. The onion project is expected to elucidate the potential role of mycorrhizae in helping manage onion soilborne pathogens, particularly use of mycorrhizal inoculants in soils that have been fumigated. The results could be translated to applications of other mycorrhizal-forming species such as carrot. The spinach research is expected to facilitate a reasonable rotation interval between spinach seed crops (5 to 8 years instead of 10-15 years), without economic losses to Fusarium and Verticillium wilts, that could enable doubling of spinach seed production in the USA. The spinach Phomopsis project is expected to clarify whether strains of the two &#39;exotic&#39; species of quarantine status are pathogenic on spinach and several other crop species, and identify potential method(s) of treating seed that kill the fungi and/or prevent seed transmission. The objective is to provide a means of overcoming the roadblock these fungi are causing to international spinach seed trade. The evolving nature of diseases that affect the PNW small-seeded vegetable seed industry highlights the continued need for a responsive research and extension program to investigate existing, new, and emerging diseases that affect vegetable seed production; develop integrated, economically-sound, and environmentally-sustainable approaches to disease management; and deliver research-based information effectively to the diversity of vegetable and seed stakeholders. The primary goals of the small-seeded vegetable seed pathology program at Washington State University are to help retain an economically-viable vegetable seed industry, and contribute towards a sustainable and secure food supply, both nationally and internationally. These goals are achieved through research and extension collaborations with WSU and other faculty and extension educators, as well as the vegetable and seed industries in the PNW, nationally, and internationally.',\n",
       " 'Plant-parasitic nematodes inflict 10-14% average annual yield losses in Hawaii. In economic terms, these crop losses translate to at least $8 billion in the United States. In addition, economic loss associated with increasing material and application costs of nematicides and economic loss associated with trade embargos due to actual or suspected quarantine status nematode infestations exacerbate nematode problems in agriculture. Public concerns about environment quality, food quality, and human health and safety relative to pest management in agricultural production require changes in the way nematodes are managed. The need for alternative, integrated nematode management has been propelled by greater societal interest in environmental protection. This project address these concerns by documenting how nematodes respond to different management strategies. The project will also develop and demonstrate different sustainable approaches to nematode management in tropical cropping systems.',\n",

       " 'Both locally and nationally, the agricultural production community (our stakeholders) is scrambling to find viable and agro-ecologically sustainable alternatives to chemical-based soil pathogen and nematode control. In addition, world travel and commerce have accelerated the dissemination of pest species, including plant-parasitic nematodes. Development and application of new diagnostic protocols for accurate identification of nematode species is beneficial and required for national and international regulatory and quarantine agencies relative to free trade and economics, as exemplified by recent trade restrictions on movement of potatoes due to findings of quarantine-status cyst or root-knot nematodes in US production areas such as Idaho. The nematology community has repeatedly advocated the need for funding support focused on the basic and applied research required to advance agro-ecologically sustainable alternative management approaches and accurate nematode detection and diagnostics. This project addresses these needs directly for the most important groups of plant parasitic nematodes. A major shift in nematode-management strategies is occurring, from almost exclusive reliance on soil-applied nematicides, to the use of combinations of alternative strategies such as crop rotation, host plant resistance, cultural manipulations and biological control (Ferris et al., 1992). An important difference from nematicides is that the alternatives are influenced directly by genetic variability existing in target nematode field populations. Hence, the successful use of alternatives requires more information to implement than nematicide-based strategies. Assessment and characterization of variability and adaptation extant in nematode populations and agro-environmental conditions influencing host-nematode interactions will assist in the successful application of alternative management approaches, in addition to guiding initial development and deployment of new strategies. For example, knowing the frequency of virulence genes in a nematode population will allow deployment of corresponding resistance genes and promotion of resistance durability, a major project focus.',\n",
       " 'Brucellosis is one of the world&#39;s most widespread zoonoses but ranks as one of the seven most neglected, according to the World Health Organization. There are over 500,000 new human cases of brucellosis annually, which is believed to be an underestimate due to underreporting. In the US, the State-Federal Cooperative Brucellosis Eradication Plan, initiated in 1934, was successful in eradicating brucellosis from livestock populations. However, the disease still has a reservoir in elk (Cervus canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) in the greater Yellowstone area (GYA) with multiple instances of spillover into Wyoming livestock in the last decade. Positive cases in livestock lead to costly quarantine and culling in addition to time consuming diagnostictesting. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department uses up to six tests over a period of weeks to reach a conclusion about the status of an animal. Therefore, having reliable testing and a short diagnostic lag time is crucial to eliminating the disease from the Wyoming and any other possible areas affected by the disease.The goal of our project is to design and validate a molecular assay using PCR techniques and DNA isolation kits that are specific for different tissue types, as well as employing sequence specific technologies that will enrich reactions and lead to higher sensitivities. It is our hope that by developing this assay, it will aid in diagnosing brucellosis cases at the species level and differentiating animals that have been previously vaccinated. The success of this project will bring us closer to eradicating brucellosis in the United States while providing stability to livestock producers in Wyoming.',\n",
       " 'As a service to NHGRI investigators, the Embryonic Stem Cell and Transgenic Mouse Core specializes in generating genetically altered mouse lines for basic studies of gene function and regulation and for the creation of mouse models of human genetic diseases. Several technologies are utilized by the Core to generate genetically altered mice. The first method is to create conventional transgenics by microinjection of DNA into fertilized embryos (pronuclear microinjection) to generate germline mice. Secondly, targeted transgenics are generated by microinjecting genetically altered embryonic stem cells (ES cells). The ES cells are modified via homologous recombination of targeted genes in the Core or, are imported ES cell lines from other institutions (i.e., IKMC) Imported lines require expansion and archiving, DNA/RNA analysis, karyotyping, and MAP/Mycoplasma testing. ES cells are then injected into 2.5 day 8-cell embryos or 3.5 day blastocysts to generate fully ES cell-derived or chimeric mice, respectively. The Core also generates transgenic mice by aggregation of tetraploid embryos with hybrid ES cells. By using 8-cell or tetraploid aggregation embryos to produce heterozygous or fully ES cell derived mice, the time and number of animals required is reduced for breeding chimeras. Recently, the Core has implemented the use of site-specific nucleases (CRISPR/Cas and TALENs)to generate mutant mice in one step with direct, targeted injection of DNA and RNA into egg pronuclei. This direct inception can generate germ line mice with multiple gene modifications. The Core archives, in multiple locations, mutant strains by cryopreservation of sperm and embryos and reconstitutes the lines by in vitro fertilization. Thus, the Core can rapidly re-establish mouse strains in the event of a disaster or outbreak as well as easily export lines more efficiently and humanely to other institutions. For quality control, the Core cryopreserves stock embryos from wild-type strains (C57Bl/6J, FVB/N, 129S6Sv/Ev and Balb/c). These embryos are also used for flexible microinjection of 8-cell embryos and fertilized eggs. The use of cryopreserved embryos reduces animal donor needs by 50-60% and allows microinjection of 2-3x more embryos per session. An additional service provided to our institute is to rederive animals into our facility by embryo transfer of fertilized eggs. Fertilized eggs are generated by IVF of imported male sperm with wildtypye oocytes. Any additional eggs/sperm are cryopreserved for disaster. Rederivation generally takes 7-8 weeks as compared to 14-16 weeks for conventional quarantine methods. Closely associated to our rederivation and cryopreservation program, is the in-house breeding colony. This colony rapidly generates mice for experiments and centralizes animals used across animal protocols (ie. cre transgenics). We perform PCR-based genotyping, breed on multiple backgrounds (129 and C57Bl/6) and cryopreserve the lines. We can readily reconstitute mice, which enables reduced rack space for maintenance breeding. Other services include embryo dissection, mouse perfusions, injections, colony maintenance, and animal identification by genotyping. The Core works with NHGRI investigators in construct design, and in basic manipulations of mouse husbandry. The Core is committed to cutting edge transgenic technologies while finding better avenues to reduce the animal requirements. For example, we are investigating inhibitors to improve ES cell quality and improved chimeras. By using inhibitors of GSK3b and MAPK, our parental cell lines and targeted lines have better morphology, controlled growth rate, and higher Nanog levels. This should improve both in-house, and the multiple imported ES cells. The Core has successfully generated mIPS derived stem cells that have been targeted and will transmit through the germ line. We prepare MEFS or tail tip fibroblasts and make them availablee to our investigators who require them for human ES and iPS studies. Moreover, we support characterization of human iPS lines by assisting in the cell injection and generation of teratomas in nude mice. The Core is utilizing protocols for genome editing using TALENs and Crispr/Cas systems. The site specific nuclease systems  allows production of genetically engineered mice with multiple gene modifications in a one step process.Core Personnel Description and Equipment Capabilities:The Transgenic Core has seven full-time employees. Lisa Garrett directs and oversees daily operations, training and experimental design. The core staff includes six staff, employed directly by the core, through a branch, or by contract. They include Jun Cheng, Gene Elliott, Kowser Hasneen, Karen Hazzard (all technical staff) and Cecilia Rivas and Elsa Escobar (animal support contractors).  The physical organization of the Core is divided into two laboratories behind the animal barrier. The third floor lab houses the central tissue culture space for ES cell growth and maintenance, a cryopreservation area, a microinjection suite with three Zeiss/Eppendorf  microinjection stations and one Nikon micromanipulation station, a molecular biology area, and administrative space for 5 individuals. The second floor laboratory is for animal use with downdraft tables and biosafety cabinets. We have a dedicated area for harvesting embryos and tissues with 4 stereomicroscopes that are available to institute investigators. This lab contains a chemical fume hood for ENU, a small animal surgery suite with 3 stereomicroscopes and downdraft tables, a tissue culture area for iPS generation, and ES cell differentiation.  There is administrative space for 2 individuals.Summary July 2013-2014 The Core utilized conventional transgenics from 42 DNA constructs( including CRISPR/Cas and TALEN) since July 2013. We have 29 ES cell - targeting constructs that are in various stages of development such as screening for homologous recombination, microinjection, and generation of germline transmitting progeny. I anticipate greater than 20 conventional transgenic constructs for the upcoming year and at least 35 targeting constructs for our institute.During the past year, we rederived in 15 lines of imported mice, cryopreserved 31 lines for disaster preparation, and archived 57 mouse lines. For the upcoming year, we will continue to cryopreserve all mutant mice imported or generated by the Core. I have modified our freezing program to reduce the numbers of embryos frozen (therefore reducing the numbers of mice) and balance the archiving with cryopreserved sperm. We have a significant increase in efficiency of recovering frozen sperm by IVF (>50%) using a modified method by Nakagata et al., J.Mamm.Ova Res. 2010. The Core has generated three new embryonic stem cell lines this past year in addition to our C57Bl6/J and hybrid 129.B6 cell lines. We now have germline competent 129S6 and B6/J albino embryonic stem cells. In addition, we have recently generated C57Bl6/N ES cells and are testing for chimerism and germline transmission.From reviewing Pubmed and information from our investigators, the Core has made substantial contributions on >120 papers from 2005-present. This includes both co-authorship and acknowledgements of several members of the Core. This compilation of papers represents any resource or mouse generated by the Core. Since January 2012, the Core has had co-authorship on at least 4 publications',\n",
       " \"Background: ARID1A is broadly accepted to be a tumor suppressor in an increasing number of cancers, including ovarian. Silencing ARID1A in ovarian surface epithelium stimulates growth, and restoration of activity in ARID1A null ovarian and endometrial cancer cells reduces proliferation, with the latter having been verified in a xenograft murine model. Immunohistochemistry studies in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) showed that loss of nuclear ARID1A was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and similar overall survival (OS) or with advanced stage, higher grade, suboptimal resection and nodal metastasis, though reports have been inconsistent relative to clinicopathologic associations. These prior investigations focused on nuclear localized ARID1A as a logical consequence of its tumor suppressor role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. We recently used a well-annotated ovarian cancer tissue microarray spanning histologic subtypes to evaluate the association between ARID1A and OS (N=259). Categorization of ovarian cancers by both nuclear and cytoplasmic ARID1A staining revealed a statistically significant difference in OS between the four groups with median survival times spanning more than 5 years (p<0.001). In terms of the extremes, women with loss of nuclear ARID1A and prevalent cytoplasmic ARID1A had the worse survival overall with a median survival time of 7 months. In contrast, ovarian cancer patients with loss of nuclear ARID1A without prevalent cytoplasmic ARID1A had the best OS with a median survival time of 74 months.Hypothesis: This Pilot Award application is focused on determining the mechanism underlying cytoplasmic quarantine of ARID1A and whether the oncogenic effect of its cytoplasmic localization is due to a simple  inactivation  of a tumor suppressor, or if ARID1A possesses a hitherto unknown oncogenic activity when localized to the cytoplasm, as is the case for other tumor suppressors, such as p21 and p27.Specific Aims: (1) Deep digital next-generation sequencing using exome capture and proteomic profiling in ovarian cancer tissue specimens that display strong cytoplasmic staining for this gene product. (2) Engineer cells to express cytoplasmic ARID1A for phenotypic characterization in vitro. (3) Determine the protein binding partners of cytoplasmic ARID1A in ovarian cancer cells and determine their relevance to carcinogenesis.Study Design:Aim 1: We aim to identify novel mutational and/or structural events that would result in less efficient import of ARID1A into the nucleus from ovarian cancer tissue specimens that display strong cytoplasmic immunostaining of ARID1A. These experiments will be conducted using targeted exome capture and deep digital sequencing of cells laser microdissected from tissue specimens, utilizing immunohistochemistry to selectively harvest cells characterized by distinct subcellular patterns of ARID1A localization. We will also utilize global, quantitative MS-based proteomics to identify protein alterations in ovarian cancers with strong vs. weak/negative cytoplasmic staining to determine if any regulators of nuclear shuttling or stability correlate with cytoplasmic ARID1A.Aim 2: Our preliminary data demonstrate the ability to quarantine ARID1A in the cytoplasm through site-directed mutagenesis of a bipartite nuclear localization sequence that we recently identified. We will create a tetracycline-inducible NLS mutant ARID1A construct and deliver this via lentivirus to various non-tumorigenic (EM-TERT1, E-Mosis-TERT1) and tumorigenic (TOV21G) ovarian cells and use several in vitro assays including cell proliferation, growth in soft agar, infiltration, apoptosis, and cell cycle to assess whether the cytoplasmic localization affects these phenotypes.Aim 3: Protein constituents of cytoplasmically quarantined ARID1A using the NLS mutant described above will be determined by IP-MS. We will prepare cytoplasmic extracts isolated from induced ovarian cancer cells harboring the tetracycline-inducible NLS ARID1A construct. Three biological replicates for each clear cell and endometrioid cell line along with negative controls to include un-induced NLS mutant ARID1A cells and anti-IgG will be performed to minimize false discovery.Innovation: We have identified a novel (mis)localization of ARID1A in cancer specimens that is linked to worse overall survival. We will determine the mechanism underlying cytoplasmic ARID1A tied to these cancers with particularly poor outcome. These combined approaches will result in discoveries that underlie the pathophysiology of ARID1A-driven ovarian cancer. This proposal benefits from the use of unique biological reagents and state-of-the-art analytical and bioinformatic platforms that have been developed and optimized to determine the systems level impact of ARID1A mislocalization on ovarian cancer. These highly innovative approaches have not been undertaken in OCCC or serous ovarian cancer; therefore, our proposal represents an unprecedented opportunity to address these cancer-specific defects in a defined and comprehensive manner.Impact: This application is a multidisciplinary effort directly responsive to the Ovarian Cancer Research Program's priority to  Understand the ... pathogenesis/progression of all types of ovarian cancer, including rare subtypes  and has been formulated to result in discoveries regarding the ARID1A tumor suppressor that will make a direct and positive impact on these clinically aggressive, therapeutically refractive, and understudied ovarian cancer subtypes.\",\n",

       " 'DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral and physiological responses to psychosocial stressors can predict the long-term health consequences of exposure to stress. These consequences include dramatically elevated risks for cardiometabolic diseases, addictions, and mental disorders. Little is known, however, about either the genetic variation underlying inter-individual variation in susceptibility to stress, or about the gene expression patterns that provide the presumed mechanism for such variation. We propose to create, using the Caribbean vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus), a translational non-human primate (NHP) model for stress responsivity studies, which will facilitate investigations of the multi-system effects of an acute psychosocial stressor on physiology, behavior and cognition. These investigations are not feasible in humans, and cannot be reliably modeled in rodents, which differ from humans too substantially in these systems. We will leverage the short-term quarantine procedures applied routinely to wild-trapped vervets on the island of St. Kitts to investigate multi-system measures hypothesized to be associated with stress-responsivity. Specifically, we will longitudinally monitor expression of genes and gene networks that are stress-regulated and that predict individual differences in behavioral and physiological sensitivit to stress. This proof of concept study will validate the proposed model by: 1) demonstrating the impact of the stressor on metabolic, inflammatory and behavioral responses; 2) characterizing inter-individual variations in stress-related traits; 3) showing mechanistic links between stress-induced changes in higher-order phenotypes and gene expression patterns. Development of this model will, in the short-term provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of stress- related diseases, and, in the long-term, pave the way for large scale genetic and genomic investigations to identify the basis for individual differences in response to stress.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal requests funding for two autoclaves to replace the capacity of the current bulk sterilizer in order to support the Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at the Ralph H. Johnson (RHJ) Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in providing high quality husbandry and surgical support for research animals. The RHJ VAMC VMU houses research animals for about two dozen investigators holding a total of 64 active Animal Component of Research Protocols (ACORPs). The animal research of these scientists represents a substantial previous and ongoing investment by the VA in finding new treatments for diseases common to the Veteran population. These RHJ VAMC researchers have been awarded $14,726,836 in total research funding with $5,256,024 from the VA for fiscal year 2014, and the September review cycle recorded submission of 15 BLR&D Merit, two Career Development, and one RR&D SPiRE proposals that include the use of animals. The VMU annual report for FY2013 showed an average daily census for mice and rats of 6,832 and 53, respectively, and annual usage totals of 21,287 mice and 299 rats. The smooth operations of the RHJ VMAC VMU require steam sterilization capabilities in order to prepare husbandry items, decontaminate equipment used for quarantine housing or exposed to biohazards, and sterilize surgical instruments and supplies. The existing autoclave, installed at the time of construction (circa 1996) of the Strom Thurmond Biomedical/Gazes Research Building, is at the end of its usable life and has had significant dysfunction limiting its use to between half and two-thirds of regular working hours during the past year. In fact, the lack of reliability of the current autoclave factored heavily into a decisin to begin routinely buying irradiated rodent feed and bedding about one year ago to avoid the frequent work stalls with which we were faced. This proposal demonstrates the need for upgraded steam sterilization equipment that will ensure the integrity of VA-funded research, including investigations into mechanisms and treatments of non-union fractures, pulmonary fibrosis, brain and spinal cord injury, heart failure, autoimmune and kidney diseases, diabetes, alcoholism, and sleep disorders, the results of which will directly benefit the health of Veterans.',\n",
       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability but the neuroanatomical abnormalities that contribute to specific cognitive deficits have not been well defined. Histopathological observations have consistently implicated reduced interneuron number as a major defect in the DS cerebral cortex. Mouse and human data indicate that interneuron development is faulty in DS and warrant further investigation in human. To better understand how mistakes in interneuron development may underlie intellectual disability in DS, we propose to test the hypothesis that the development of human trisomy 21 (Ts21) interneuron progenitors is impaired. We will develop an in vitro paradigm that uses human induced pluripotent stem cells to model both spatial and temporal aspects of human interneuron progenitor development. Using this system, we will determine whether Ts21 iPSC-derived interneuron progenitors have defects in interneuron generation that may lead to the generation of fewer interneurons in DS brain.',\n",

These technologies will have a broad impact in health science in preclinical models of neuro-degenerative diseases and cancer, and, as we elaborate in Aim 4, help guide the identification of clinically relevant imaging biomarkers. To demonstrate the technologies' utility, we will address fundamental questions about cerebral vascular physiology: How do microvascular flow properties impact tissue oxygenation, and how do age-related vascular alterations compromise tissue oxygenation? We will then relate these findings to clinically relevant imaging biomarkers.\",\n",

       " 'This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project will develop a mobile sensor technology for performing detection and identification of viral and bacterial pathogens. By means of a smartphone-based detection instrument, the results are shared with a cloud-based data management service that will enable physicians to rapidly visualize the geographical and temporal spread of infectious disease. When deployed by a community of medical users (such as veterinarians or point-of-care clinicians), the PathTracker system will enable rapid determination and reporting of instances of infectious disease that can inform treatment and quarantine responses that are currently not possible with tests performed at central laboratory facilities.    Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) currently represent the most sensitive and specific approaches for identification of viral or bacterial pathogens, with intense research focus directed towards miniaturization, acceleration, and automation of the protocol for amplifying disease-specific DNA sequences to easily-measured concentration. The plan is to apply the results of previously NSF-funded advances in photonic crystal enhanced fluorescence (PCEF) and smartphone fluorescence spectroscopy to implement PCR or LAMP assays within sub-¿l liquid volumes for reduction in the assay amplification time to register a measurable fluorescent signal. Importantly, the detection approach enables >10x multiplexing of PCR (or LAMP) reactions within a chip that can be  swiped  through a custom handheld detection instrument that interfaces with the back-facing camera of a conventional smartphone in a manner that is similar to reading a credit card. A mobile device software application will guide the user through the assay process, interpret the results of the detection (including correlation of assay measurements with on-chip experimental controls), and communicate results to a cloud-based data management system along with other relevant information provided by the user. Importantly, the app will enable the user to view the results of tests performed by other users, with a mobile device interface that enables simple visualization of the locations, times, and circumstances surrounding positive/negative tests. The system will enable users to request customizable alerts when positive tests occur within the network of users, and to highlight confirmed positive cases when conventional laboratory tests can confirm results of positive field tests. The app will track outcomes and report statistics on system performance, including Receiver Operating Characteristic of assays.   While the system will initially be deployed in the context of equine infectious disease representing an opportunity to mitigate enormous economic losses associated with infectious disease in the horse industry, the developed technology will be equally applicable to humans, food animals, and companion animals. Considering the economic and health impact of ebola, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, when PathTracker is fully deployed within developing nations, the potential of the system to save lives by rapid delivery effective treatment, quarantine of infectious patients, and rapid identification/reporting of new cases is enormous.

       " 'Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for phytoplankton that often limits primary production in the ocean, and its availability therefore plays a key role in global ocean productivity. The amounts and form in which nitrogen exist are controlled by microorganisms. One microorganism-mediated process is known as nitrification, which oxidizes ammonia or ammonium to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate, nitrate being the bioavailable form of nitrogen. While this is the well-accepted process of nitrification, preliminary results strongly suggest that a nitrogen-containing compound know as polyamine nitrogen may be directly converted by some microorganisms to nitrate. However, the importance of this process for global biogeochemical nitrogen cycling is unknown. The goal of this study is to evaluate the biogeochemical significance of direct oxidation of polyamine nitrogen, as a model organic nitrogen compound, to nitrification compared to canonical nitrification of ammonia. The project will result in training a postdoctoral researcher and provide opportunities for undergraduates to gain hands-on experience with research on microbial geochemistry and coastal ecosystem processes. Project personnel will also work with the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research program to engage a K-12 science teacher in the project.  Ammonia oxidation is a key step in the process of converting fixed nitrogen to dinitrogen gas and thus is central to the global nitrogen cycle and to removing excess fixed nitrogen from coastal waters with high concentrations of nutrients. Recent research has shown that Thaumarchaeota play a major role in ammonia oxidation in the ocean. Experiments with enrichment cultures and coastal water samples where ammonia oxidizing archaea are the dominant ammonia oxidizers, show that some forms of organic nitrogen may be oxidized directly to nitrogen oxides without first being regenerated as ammonium. Of the substrates tested, polyamine and particularly putrescine nitrogen appear to be oxidized directly to nitrogen oxides, while amino acid and urea nitrogen is first regenerated as ammonium and then oxidized. The investigators will examine this process in detail over three years using enrichment cultures and experiments conducted with coastal bacterioplankton. Specifically, they will aim to better understand 1) the consequences of this novel process to ocean geochemistry, 2) the fate of the carbon present in polyamines, 3) what organisms are responsible for the direct oxidation, and 4) the chemical characteristics of the organic nitrogen compounds accessible to direct oxidation.',\n",
       " \"Nitrogen is a critical nutrient in the world's oceans because, among other things, it is a major component of living organisms and can be a driver in primary productivity. Nitrogen is present in the ocean in a number of organic and inorganic forms, which vary in their ease in being assimilated by marine organisms. Cyanate is a simple form of organic nitrogen present in the ocean, although its abundance and importance to the ocean nitrogen cycle is poorly understood. Using newly developed and tested methods for measuring ambient cyanate concentrations and its uptake in seawater, researchers will analyze the distribution, sources, and geochemistry of cyanate in shelf waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Results from this project will elucidate the importance of cyanate in the marine nitrogen cycle and transform understanding of cyanate production and assimilation in the sea. This project will provide a unique opportunity for both graduate student research and undergraduate training, and will likely expose underrepresented groups to marine sciences.Although physiological and genomic evidence suggest that marine microbes can utilize a broad array of inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds, cyanate's role in the marine nitrogen cycle has not yet been examined. As one of the simplest organic nitrogen compounds, cyanate has likely been present in the environment over Earth's long history. Evidence suggests that cyanate metabolism appeared early on in bacterial genomes and thus, the study of cyanate assimilation in the contemporary ocean may illuminate microbial processes with deep evolutionary roots. However, a decade since discovering the genomic capacity for cyanate utilization in marine cyanobacteria, little is still known about cyanate distributions in the environment, how it is produced, and how widespread cyanate utilization is among marine microbes. To further understanding of cyanate's role in the marine nitrogen cycle, a combination of geochemical approaches will be used to assess: 1) the distribution of cyanate in the marine environment, 2) potential sources of cyanate and the timescales at which cyanate is produced, 3) the rate of cyanate removal via microbial uptake and spontaneous decomposition, and 4) the geochemical coupling between cyanate production and consumption. Results generated from this study will be important for augmenting knowledge of the marine nitrogen cycle, refining biogeochemical models, and further understanding of the functioning of marine microbial communities.\",\n",

The goal is to develop a highly sensitive test that can be used on patients who have not yet shown any symptoms. Results from this project could save uninfected patients the emotional burden as well as the cost of the currently imposed 3-week quarantine. Early detection may also greatly improve the survival rate of Ebola patients.  This critical piece of work will meet a key and immediate need in the nation's Ebola response.The project described in this proposal seeks to identify antibody-like proteins with the desired dynamical properties using molecular dynamic simulations done by the proposing team. These dynamical properties are at the atomic level, and will be obtained by performing all-atom petascale MD computer simulations on Blue Waters. The proposing team will serve as a key intermediary in the experiment cycle. They will take potential antibodies developed by an ALB design team at Pennsylvania State University, identify, through petascale simulations, characterize the dynamics of the ALBs and optimize the conformational state change, and provide these results to a bio-sensor laboratory at University of California, Santa Barbara, who will design and build the tool. Since the modelling and simulation will be a collaborative effort with scientists at both ends, the proposing team will also build a remote visualization tool for scientists to collaborate over the experimentation.\",\n",
       " 'Increased nitrogen loading from human activities degrades water quality and threatens aquatic biodiversity.  It has long been assumed that as nitrogen loading to rivers increases, nitrogen production in the stream via biological nitrogen fixation (the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas to biologically available nitrogen) would cease. At the same time nitrogen loss via denitrification (the conversion of available nitrogen back to nitrogen gas) would increase, causing a net reduction in nitrogen in rivers and streams. Yet, recent work in estuaries and lakes suggests that high rates of both nitrogen fixation and denitrification can co-occur across a range of nitrogen loadings, challenging this widely-held assumption.  This research will provide fundamental understanding about the response of rivers to anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment and will enable better management of nitrogen cycling at regional and global scales. This work also seeks to create a more ecologically-informed citizenry by integrating ecosystem ecology techniques into GK-12 and undergraduate education.  The construction of a mobile analytical lab to facilitate sampling streams across the United States will be accomplished through a unique collaboration among engineering and biology-oriented undergraduates and faculty at Michigan Tech. The mobile lab will also be used to design new laboratory exercises for an undergraduate ecology course, support student research projects, and facilitate outreach to GK-12 students in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan.This study will apply new analytical techniques and new stream models in the context of observational and experimental manipulations of nutrient loading to test hypotheses on the balance between nitrogen fixation and denitrification across gradients of nitrogen loads in streams and rivers at the continental scale.  The study will address three fundamental questions:  (1) Do N fixation and denitrification co-exist in streams across a natural range of nitrogen concentrations, as they do in other aquatic ecosystems?, (2) Do  hot spots  and  hot moments , i.e., spatial and temporal heterogeneity, facilitate this co-existence?, and (3) Do increasing nutrient loads shift the balance to favor losses via denitrification? The study will capitalize on the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as a continental-scale experimental framework to test the hypotheses through three interacting research elements: a gradient study of N2 fixation and denitrification (years 1-4), a multi-scale spatial and temporal study to identify hot spots and hot moments of N2 fixation and denitrification (years 2-5), and an experimental study of nutrient enrichment effects on N2 fixation and denitrification in streams (years 4-5). The project will use MIMS as a new analytical technique along with acetylene reduction and acetylene block assays to measure N fixation and denitrification, and to couple these measurements with reach-scale models commonly used to estimate stream metabolism to estimate denitrification and N2 fixation.',\n",

Secondary organic aerosols are small particles composed of compounds formed from the atmospheric transformation of volatile organic gases. This research is being conducted in an environmental chamber where the composition and optical properties of the aerosols (such as how they scatter or absorb light) can be measured as the conditions in the chamber change.  This information is critical for improving model estimates of the direct radiative forcing of secondary organic aerosol and for understanding how they create haze and influence climate.  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.   Environmental chamber experiments are being conducted to study the dependence of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) optical characteristics on parent hydrocarbon, nature and degree of oxidation, relative humidity, and chemical characteristics.  The oxidation experiments will involve reactions of hydrocarbons that are important SOA precursors influenced by urban, biomass burning, and biogenically influenced sources, in order to better represent the ambient SOA found in different environments. The oxidation schemes tested will involve different sources of photooxidation radicals and different levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to span a range of NOx-free, intermediate-, and high-NOx conditions during the SOA generation and aging processes.   The educational objectives of the project are focused on supporting local high school teachers and future STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) teachers in their professional development, and improving the STEM related skills among high school students.\",\n",
       " '1510255 (Goel). Wetlands provide environmental sustainability by removing contaminants and supporting different habitats. However, the proper functioning of wetland ecosystems relies on the functioning of microbial communities living in these ecosystems. Several factors can affect the microbial community composition in wetlands. One such factor is bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria only. Almost nothing is known about the bacteria-phage interactions in wetlands, although phages are known to affect bacterial populations in marine environments by killing bacteria, mediating gene transfers, and changing nitrogen and carbon cycles. This research, which is a collaborative effort between an environmental engineer (Dr. Ramesh Goel) and a phage expert (Dr. Sherwood Casjens), will investigate this relatively unexplored area. This project is intended to determine whether bacteriophages play significant roles in controlling bacterial populations in wetlands and thus in controlling wetland microbial processes, and, in turn, critically important wetland ecological functions.Specifically, the objectives are to understand bacteriophages (quantity and diversity) in the Great Salt Lake wetlands as a model ecosystem, and to understand, using genomics and experiments, whether bacteriophages are affecting the bacterial community structure in wetlands. Preliminary results show that the wetland bacterial community, especially in sediments, is affected by bacteriophages, thus questioning the long term sustainability of wetland functioning for contaminant removal. The experimental approach in this project will evaluate the role of bacteriophage life-cycles in affecting wetland bacterial communities. A phage metagenomic approach will shed light on whether phages in wetland sediments are participating in gene transfers through their well-known lysogenic infection cycle. Fundamental knowledge gained in this research is anticipated to be applicable in other natural (i.e., contaminated subsurface and river sediments) and engineered systems (i.e., biofilms in drinking water distribution systems). Results will be disseminated not only through peer reviewed publications but also community workshops for local wetland managers.This award is co-funded by the MCB Division of the BIO Directorate and the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program under BIOMAPS.',\n",

The model will include parameters based on the characteristics of the pathogen as well as the behavior of people during outbreak situations. The results from this model will help public health officials to design and execute efficient intervention strategies for the current outbreak based on realistic pathogen features and human behaviors and help them prepare for future outbreaks.Stemming from existing models, the investigators will develop contact networks utilizing explicit agent mobility based on human behaviors.  The model will generate two types of networks: a mobility and contact network as well as a disease transmission network. The model will incorporate behaviors based on evolving self-knowledge, e.g. the set of behaviors that people employ once they are aware or suspect they are infected; as well as behaviors that are in response to interventions and messaging, e.g. complying with recommendations for quarantine or not.  This modeling effort contrasts with previous work on disease transmission modeling, because the contact networks will be generated by this model based on representative behaviors as opposed to being applied to the model based on theoretical network structures or previous outbreak data.',\n",
       " \"As the world faces a large outbreak of Ebola epidemic, several vaccines are currently in clinical trials with a reasonable chance of being available in the field in early 2015. Since the initial amount of vaccine will be limited, the understanding of Ebola epidemic dynamics is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of public health intervention through a combination of targeted vaccination, monitoring and quarantine.  This project is concerned with developing a realistic but at the same time mathematically tractable and statistically predictive dynamic model of the current world-wide Ebola epidemics.  The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.  The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States. It is expected that the model will allow  public health and government officials to quickly analyze a host of different  intervention scenarios  in order to  speed up the current epidemic's  dissipation and to select the most effective way of preventing, or at least minimizing, the future outbreaks.\",\n",

       " 'China?s marine and freshwaters are among the most nitrogen polluted in the world.  Nitrogen pollution has been linked with severe water quality impairment, ranging from nuisance and toxic algal blooms, oxygen depletion, loss of fisheries, and changes in biodiversity.  Although the effect of total nutrient loading has been well explored in terms of promoting the growth of algae (algal blooms), the effects of changing nitrogen forms and proportions on algal community composition and productivity are poorly understood in systems experiencing prolonged nutrient loading.  In this study, it is hypothesized that nitrogen in the form of ammonium will favor the development of harmful algal blooms, including cyanobacteria and will reduce primary production, compared to when nitrogen in the form of nitrate is available. This project will involve a series of experiments on natural waters collected from the Hangzhou and Taihu regions of China to assess the physiological response of algae to the addition of changing nitrogen forms. This research involves collaboration with Dr. Mengmeng Tong, well known for her expertise in toxic algal blooms, at Zhejiang University, Ocean College.   Eutrophication observed in China is of particular concern, considering nutrient loads are rising and relative nitrogen (N) forms reaching aquatic ecosystems are changing, resulting in increasing reduced (e.g. NH4+) compared to oxidized forms of N (NO3-).  Not all algae have the same response to nutrient enrichments, and some algae have preferences for different nutrient forms. Natural samples will be variably enriched with NH4+ and NO3- and will be incubated under natural light and temperature conditions for several days during which phytoplankton community composition, biomass accumulation, and productivity will be tracked. Recognizing that the classic limiting nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus (P) are typically available in excess in these nutrient impacted systems prompts this study to focus specifically on how changing N form in the presence of adequate nutrient supplies alter phytoplankton community composition and physiology.

       " \"1509759 - SantangeloIn order to mitigate the spread of Ebola infections, detecting the virus in patients before the onset of symptoms is imperative.  This requires, fast, sensitive and specific detection of the virus.  Current methods lack sensitivity and ease of use.  This project will adapt the author's previous method for detecting ultra low Ebola concentration in patient's blood.  Two new methods will be developed; one can be used in the field and the second one, which is more rigorous, is suitable for laboratory tests. These methods are expected to reduce the rate at which Ebola epidemic spreads.Currently quantitative PCR is the state-of-the-art for Ebola detection, typically from blood samples.  These tests though, are time intensive and require a high degree of expertise to perform.  Further the method is useful when viral concentration is relatively high in the patient. Given the need to test large numbers of people as a part of quarantine strategies, improved early diagnostics are imperative. Therefore the aim of the project is to develop a more sensitive approach to detecting Ebola viral RNA (vRNA) and single viral particles. The research team will develop a single tube assay for detecting viral RNA in whole blood, suitable for field application. In addition, a slide-based assay for detecting single viral particles will also be developed, through the detection of vRNA-protein interactions, with single virion sensitivity suitable for a laboratory setting. In both cases, peptide labeled, single RNA sensitive, RNA imaging probes and proximity ligation assay (PLA) methods will be utilized.  The results will be compared with current methods to demonstrate the improved sensitivity.  The combinations of both site-specific probe binding and distance-dependent detection and amplification, will ensure both specificity (zero errors) and sensitivity (<10 copies/ml).\",\n",
       " 'Bacterial wilt is a disease that occurs in many important agricultural crops, including pepper, tobacco, tomato, and potato, and can be caused by the bacterium Ralstonia solancearum. This bacterium is classified into 5 races that are based loosely on host ranges, and into 5 biovars, which are based upon their differential ability to utilize a panel of carbohydrates. While Race 1 is endemic to the Southern United States, Ralstonia solancearum race 3 biovar 2 (R3b2) is not known to occur naturally in the U.S. and therefore is considered a select agent. R3b2 can devastate crops, leading to major economic losses worldwide: global damages in world potato crops alone from R3b2 are estimated to be over $950 million per year, which is why its quarantine is crucial for protecting American agricultural interests. Presently, visual inspections remain the primary way to monitor agricultural imports for this disease. Asymptomatic plant material, however, easily could allow R3b2 to breach U.S. borders. There have been, in fact, at least two recent cases of R3b2 infestations being traced back to geranium imports from Kenya and Guatemala, exemplifying the need for an early detection system to be in place at U.S. ports of entry. Available tests are not fast enough to conduct large-scale inspections, nor are they sensitive enough to detect asymptomatic plant material. In addition, most of the tests require dedicated laboratories able to conduct complex assay procedures. In the recovery plan for Ralstonia solancearum race 3 biovar 2, which was drafted as part of the National Plant Disease Recovery System, the USDA lists one of the  Highly important  research priorities as:  explor[ing] novel diagnostic techniques to detect R3b2 quickly and at low concentrations, such as ... highly sensitive antibody-responsive cell culture systems.  PathSensors, Inc. has responded to this research priority by proposing to build a multi-well diagnostic device using CANARY&reg; technology.CANARY&reg; technology is a cell-based biosensor technology that demonstrates unprecedented performance in terms of speed, sensitivity, and ease-of-use when compared with other standard detection technologies. The USDA has invested over one million dollars to develop a CANARY&reg; biosensor cell line to detect Ralstonia and the USDA CPHST Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, has used this biosensor to achieve one of the lowest limits of detection of any CANARY&reg; biosensor based, or other type, assay for the detection of Ralstonia, achieving an LoD of 3 cfu from infected potato slices. PathSensors, Inc. intends to add its expertise to the USDA&#39;s efforts to develop efficient sample preparation methods to achieve similar results with geranium stem samples. Instrumentation and sample processing steps need to be optimized, however, in order for CANARY&reg; technology to be used efficiently at plant testing stations. To maximize the benefits of CANARY&reg; technology, we must develop a new multiplex instrument platform as well as a simple and rapid means for plant sample preparation and introduction to the biosensors. The instrument system will consist of commercially available parts linked together and controlled through an integrated computer software system. Once the optimum sample process steps have been established, the user will be led through all steps of the assay via a computer software program. Positive or negative sample identifications will be provided by processing the CANARY&reg; light output signal through an automated detection algorithm.Upon its completion, this system can be deployed and used in survey programs, field labs, and diagnostic testing facilities. Moreover, this system will be made available to exporters to assure their plants are pathogen-free prior to shipping. After developing a multi-well diagnostic device, PathSensors, Inc. will further adapt the system for use with other existing plant pathogen CANARY&reg; cell lines, such as those for Phytophthora and Citrus leprosis virus.',\n",

Log fumigations require high doses of MB to kill pinewood nematodes and the oak wilt fungus, the two most important pests for log exports. The phase-out of MB has made the fumigant more expensive and makes its availability in the future uncertain. In addition, federal and state air quality regulations restrict MB use and thus have reduced the volume of log exports from the US. In the future, if quarantine and pre-shipment use exemptions for MB for log exports expire or are restricted our log exporters will be left with few options to effectively treat logs for export.

Nonpoint source nutrient pollution is considered to be the driving force behind accelerated eutrophication of surface waters, and Lake Mendota (Madison, WI) is no exception. Coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical process models hold great promise as both research and management tools for lake ecosystems.

The trait profile of each tribe will reveal its contribution to nutrient cycling, and trade-offs between traits and environmental variables can be used to parameterize functional modules within ecosystem-scale predictive models. In addition, the proposed work targets a major knowledge gap in microbial ecology--ecological trait inference from (meta)genome sequences--and should serve as a model for other ecosystems facing similar challenges (such as soils).',\n",
       " 'Non-techncal SummaryThe plant pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt disease of many economically important crops. Humans have distributed different strains of R. solanacearum around the world, but different strains rarely occur in the same field and have never been found in the same plant, for unknown reasons. American strain K60 makes several proteins, called bacteriocins, that inhibit other R. solanacearum strains, including a strain called Race 3, which causes potato brown rot and geranium wilt. Race 3 is listed as a federal Select Agent quarantine pathogen because it poses a serious threat to U.S. agriculture. Strain K60 outcompetes Race 3 in both stems and rhizospheres of tomato plants. To better understand the role of bacteriocins in competitive fitness and exclusion of this major pathogen, we propose to: 1) Characterize the biological functions of K60&#39;s bacteriocins using biochemical and mutational analysis; 2) Determine the role of bacteriocins in the competitive fitness of R. solanacearum on host plants, using defined mutant strains. To explore the feasibility of using bacteriocins to control potato brown rot and exclude Race 3 from imported geranium cuttings, we will: 3) Construct and test bacteriocin-expressing potato and geranium lines. Together, the proposed experiments will both elucidate the basic biology of the abundant bacteriocins produced by R. solanacearum and develop a novel approach for controlling a significant threat to American agriculture.',\n",

We will use whole community gene transcript sequencing, which allows all active processes within communities to be elucidated based on their DNA sequence, to understand what processes occur. We will also measure bulk processes of bacterial ecology, like abundance (using microscopy) and productivity (by incorporation of radioactively-labeled DNA precursors) to study how bacterioplankton change in overall biomass and growth over the seasonal cycle and with perturbation. Overall, the aim of this study is to understand natural variation in bacterial community abundance, growth and activity, and to predict how this will change under future climate change scenarios.',\n",
       " 'From 2002 to 2013, an average of 25 new terrestrial arthropod species per year was reported in Hawaii as compared to 18 species per year between 1937 and 1976. Many of these invasive species have become serious pests to Hawaii&#39;s agriculture, landscape, and forests, negatively impacting the environment, human and animal health, and the overall quality of life in Hawaii. This project will focus on two recent incursions, little fire ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata, and coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros; however, any new alien pest species that are detected in the state during this project may also be targeted following similar protocol.Previous efforts in Hawaii demonstrate that LFA is difficult to control under various conditions with commercially available ant bait products because 1) most ant baits consist of dry granules that decompose quickly, become moldy and unattractive to ants, and cannot be applied during or soon after rainfall, 2) LFA form nests in both trees and at ground level, necessitating placing baits in trees, and 3) finally, even after repeated weekly or bi-weekly treatments with currently available granular baits, ant activity quickly returns to pre-treatment levels after treatments cease.CRB is identified by USDA as one of the damaging pests to coconut, oil palms, and many other palm species, not previously present in the US, which could result in significant economic losses to the plant nursery industry, hotels and resort landscaping, and the state&#39;s tourism industry. It was first detected in December 2013 at the Honolulu International Airport and adjacent Joint Base Pearl Harbor - Hickam, and has since spread. Almost certainly, additional populations of CRB are will be discovered in Hawaii as the initial infestation site contained all stages of CRB and was estimated to be established for over a year. Effective chemical and biological control strategies need to be identified as more infested sites are discovered.The goal of this research and extension proposal is to mitigate the impact of invasive species in Hawaii by implementing a rapid response, research and extension program, and thereby improving the overall quality of life in Hawaii. The overall objective of this research and extension project is to improve monitoring efforts state-wide targeting high-risk points of entry and to provide a rapid response to invasive species by immediately developing an effective field management program and identifying effective postharvest treatments. Specific objectives to address the little fire ant (LFA, Wasmannia auropunctata) are to: 1) develop quarantine treatment protocols for LFA infested plant materials being exported or transported to LFA uninfested islands, states and countries, 2) evaluate aerial applications of U.S. EPA approvable bait toxicant systems for ground and arboreal infestations, and 3) support classical biological control programs by identifying potential natural enemies. Specific objectives of this project to address the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB, Oryctes rhinoceros) and other coconut pests are to: 1) develop rapid field management programs for CRB that maximize the use of biopesticides and reduced-risk pesticides, 2) explore heat and irradiation treatments for CRB that can be integrated with field pest management programs in a systems approach to quarantine security. 3) survey and detect natural enemies and pathogens in established CRB populations in Hawaii, and develop inoculative and conservative biological control programs.',\n",
       " 'Aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of agriculture, accounting for close to half of the world&#39;s total food fish supply. Wild harvests for numerous species have reached or exceeded maximum sustainable yields, and aquaculture is expected to fill the void. Meanwhile, growing populations have increased demand for high-quality dietary protein sources. Improvements to domestic aquaculture practices are urgently needed to meet world seafood demands while empowering the U.S. aquaculture industry to compete in the global aquaculture trade (Enhancing Agricultural Production Systems/Global Food Security and Hunger). One of the highest priority areas for improvement is the development of effective strategies for decreasing disease mortality levels in aquaculture production, including implementation of better vaccines and robust genetic selection programs. Disease outbreaks caused by the parasite Amyloodinium ocellatum are an annual threat to marine aquaculture operations worldwide, necessitating expensive construction of quarantine facilities and laborious water treatment and handling regimens, and representing a concrete challenge to presenting an environmentally sustainable face for mariculture to the general public. Despite its widespread impact, our understanding of A. ocellatum infectious processes remains limited. The proposed research combines investigator expertise across marine aquaculture, parasitology, genomics, and pathology to directly focus on critical factors governing A. ocellatum virulence and host susceptibility with the long-term goal of translating our findings into practical therapeutics and/or gene expression-based biomarkers for selection. This multi-disciplinary approach combining both basic and applied aspects of research on a pathogen with global significance should be of great interest for several funding agencies including USDA, Foundational Program and Food Security panels, NSF (Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases; Symbiosis, Defense, and Self-Recognition) and NOAA Sea Grant Aquaculture Research Program as well as for a myriad of DHOS BP funding opportunities. Research findings afforded by AAES support will be used to strengthen applications to these agencies and other extramural sources. Additionally, funding would support the establishment of concrete linkages in this important area between AU and University of Southern Mississippi&#39;s Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (a recognized leader in Gulf mariculture).',\n",
       " 'Agricultural production addictively relies on fossil fuel-derived fertilizer, which is the largest single source of reactive nitrogen in the biosphere contributing to climate change. However, single-cycle nature fertilizer use would not meet the increasing food and bioenergy demand. Renewable energy can be obtained via various viable sources such as solar, wind and even geothermal. We propose a new paradigm, dubbed as  Environment-Enhancing Energy (E2-Energy) , and a demonstration lab-scale system has been established at University of Illinois, which has a capacity of 2 gallon/day biocrude oil production from manure and algae grown in the manure water treatment system.In this approach, biowaste is first converted into biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Second, fast-growing algae are cultivated in the wastewaters from original liquid waste and HTL reactor to uptake excess nutrients and capture carbon dioxide. Finally, the algae will be fed back to the HTL process to be converted into additional biocrude. The engineered E2-Energy technology mimics the natural process of forming fossil fuels, but reduces geologic time scales to less than an hour. This has shown that E2-Energy process can reuse nutrients 3 (by experiment) to 10 (by modeling) times, which amplifies the original biomass by the same factor. As a result, the nitrogen efficiency is increased, for example, from a baseline of 35% to 105 - 350% based on corn for ethanol production.The United States has an estimated 59 million dry tons (USDA, 2008, 2009; DOE, 2011) of sustainably collectable livestock manure containing approximately 1.2 million tons of nitrogen. This alone can be used to enhance nitrogen efficiency and the production of biomass and bioenergy by deploying the E2-Energy technology. This amount of nitrogen in manure has the potential to be recycled multiple times to produce 180 - 600 million tons of mixed algal-bacteria feedstocks that can be subsequently converted into 54 - 300 million tons of biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), while reducing million tons of nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere or waterways. It could revolutionize the ways of food and renewable fuel production and water reuse if we utilize the nutrient content and wastewater from other sources including municipal sanitary districts.',\n",

       " 'Estimates over the last 20 years indicate that plant-parasitic nematodes cause 10-14% average annual yield loss among the world&#39;s major crops, and losses ranging from minimal in some localities to as high as 15% in other areas in United States&#39; major crops. Economic loss associated with increasing material and application costs of nematicides and economic loss associated with trade embargos due to actual or suspected quarantine status nematode infestations exacerbate nematode problems in agriculture. Increasingly, scientific evidence and public awareness have heightened concerns about environment quality, food quality, and human health and safety relative to pest management in agricultural production. The need for alternative, integrated nematode management has been propelled by the actions triggered by the Montreal Protocol and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of the 1990&#39;s. The nematology community has repeatedly advocated the need for funding support focused on the basic and applied research required to advance agro-ecologically sustainable alternative management approaches and accurate nematode detection and diagnostics. Thisproject addresses these needs directly for the most important groups of plant parasitic nematodes.The aproaches ustilized by collaborating project scientists to collect and produce reultsinclude: characterization of genetic and biological variation in nematodes tht are negatively impacting relevant crop productionaand trade; determiningthe processes used by nematodes to adapt toplant hosts, agro-ecosystems and their environment; andthedevelopment andassessment ofnematode management strategies in agricultural systems. These results will then be disseminated totarget audiences through peer-reviewed journals, annual progress reports, scientific meeting presentations, and websites. The application of the project findings should expedite the development of new, environmentally benign management strategies to minimize economic losses from nematodes. This in turn should help boost the international competitiveness of our agricultural production systems, at a time when competitive advantage is being eroded by the loss, and potential further loss, of nematicides. The project will also benefit the diagnosis and response process required when invasive nematode pests are suspected or found in production fields or in traded agricultural products.',\n",
       " 'This project will conduct research on biological control of alien invasive plants. Surveys for insect natural enemies of invasive plants will be carried out in countries where the plants originated, and those believed to be host specific based on collection records and taxonomic affiliation, will be collected for establishment of laboratory colonies in a quarantine laboratory in Florida. Once insect colonies are established, studies will be conducted to determine the range of plants on which the insects can survive and reproduce. Additional studies on the biologies of candidate biological control agents will include determination of developmental time, longevity, fecundity and tolerance to high and low temperatures. Petitions for field release will be prepared for insects that are deemed to be safe, and submitted to state and federal authorities for review and approval. Once approval to release is granted, insects will be mass reared, released in the environment and evaluated for their impact to plant populations.',\n",

Objective 2: Evaluate efficacy of novel technologies for control of CFT and mitigation of acaricide resistance. Subobjective 2A: Evaluate natural products with acaricidal properties for tick control. Subobjective 2B: Evaluate natural products with repellent or attractant properties for tick control. Objective 3: Develop methods that decrease the impact of wildlife as CFT reservoirs. Subobjective 3A: Evaluate efficacy of anti-tick vaccine formulations for control of ticks on wildlife.  Objective 4: Improve species distribution and ecological niche models of CFT species, and specify changes that may occur due to climate change. Subobjective 4A: Update and mine the historical CFT GIS database to produce maps and tools to support APHIS eradication efforts. Subobjective 4B: Assess effect of climate change predictions on recurring cycles of CFT outbreak activity.  Approach: Utilize our unique laboratory resources and infrastructure to evaluate new formulations of compounds for long-acting efficacy against strains of cattle fever ticks that are susceptible or resistant to commercially available acaricidal products. This effort will help prioritize efforts with stakeholder groups to deliver products the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program can use in the Permanent Quarantine Zone. Assess utility of non-invasive procedures, like near-infrared spectroscopy of livestock fecal samples, to detect cattle fever tick infestations. Finding non-invasive alternatives to hands-on inspection (scratching) offer the potential to streamline operations and enhance detection of infestations by Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program personnel. Screen plant-derived substances to identify novel compounds that are active against cattle fever ticks. Research on natural products will enable the discovery of molecules that could be optimized for acaricidal efficacy. Determine immunogenicity in white-tailed deer of novel Bm86-based vaccine developed to vaccinate cattle in the Permanent Quarantine Zone. Confirming that the novel Bm86-based vaccine developed for cattle can also elicit a specific immune response against cattle fever ticks in white-tailed deer will provide a tool that could be used to minimize the impact of wildlife as tick reservoirs.     Refine methods applied to cattle fever tick outbreaks using remote sensing technologies and models predicting habitat suitability and species distribution. The improvement of those methods could be used to develop science-based predictive tools the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program could use to adapt future strategies. Overall, the approaches described above aim to deliver science-based tools that the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program can integrate to adapt operations, mitigate the impact of global change, and keep the U.S. free of cattle fever ticks in a sustainable manner.',\n",

Objective 2:  Conduct field releases and evaluate impacts of extant (indigenous) and previously introduced parasitoids on populations of wood-boring beetles such as EAB and ALB in the United States, while elucidating factors that influence successful establishment of introduced biological control agents, such as climate adaptation, release methodology, genetic variation in founder populations and risk-spreading (diapause) strategy.  Objective 3:  For newly discovered parasitoids of ALB, EAB and other invasive pests, and based on studies of life histories and reproductive biology, develop effective rearing technologies for these natural enemies, focusing on optimizing host stage, host substrate complex, temperature, photoperiod and relative humidity.   Subobjective 3a - Characterize the reproductive biology, risk-spreading (diapause) strategy and key life history parameters of most promising parasitoid species. Subobjective 3b - Determine the optimal host stage and host-substrate complex in association with host density and host-to-parasitoid ratio. Subobjective 3c - Determine the optimal environmental conditions for adult parasitoid survival, oviposition and progeny development inc  Approach: Using the approaches relevant to the knowledge base of the targeted pests and their natural enemies, we will conduct foreign explorations for new natural enemies from the pests’ native home (Northeast Asia) and construct life tables of the target pest populations to evaluate the impact of the natural enemies on the pests’ population dynamics in Northeast Asia. After selecting the most promising (or efficient) natural enemies, we will test the selected natural enemies against non-target wood-boring insects in North America to delineate their host range for biological control introduction against the target pests.  Upon regulatory approval for environmental releases of the discovered natural enemies in North America, we will conduct field experiments to assess their establishment, dispersal and impacts on the target pests’ population in the U.S.   Laboratory studies will also be conducted to collect information on the parasitoid’s biology, risk-spreading and reproductive strategy and life history and to develop efficient rearing methods for mass-production of the introduced natural enemies for biological control releases.

Sub-objective 2A: Conduct retrospective analyses of current/past biological control programs (where appropriate). Sub-objective 2B: Conduct laboratory and field studies of selected biological traits and ecological requirements relevant to the establishment and efficacy of the target biological control agents.  3: Prepare (with collaborators, when appropriate and necessary) petitions to regulatory agencies for field release of candidate agents, conduct field releases for establishment of new agents, and monitor and evaluate the impact of these natural enemies on target pest populations and on non-target species in the field.  Sub-objective 3A: Develop and submit a petition for release that describes the importance of the target pest and the efficacy and safety of the candidate biocontrol agent; and participate in the regulatory decision process as needed. Sub-objective 3B: Conduct releases and post-release monitoring (with cooperators when necessary) of permitted natural enemies.  Approach: Classical (importation) biological control is a pest management technology that is environmentally safe and sustainable.  This project focuses on discovery, evaluation, and establishment of classical biological control agents of selected agricultural pests in the U.S.  Previous research continued into this project addresses as targets tarnished plant bugs, brown marmorated stink bug; and spotted wing drosophila. New targets may be added at any time according to national need.  To address objective (1) we will conduct foreign exploration in Asia and other regions as needed to discover, identify and evaluate the biology, ecology, and efficacy of exotic predators and parasitoids as classical biological control agents of the targeted pests. Agents discovered in exploration will be returned to our laboratory and identified using the best available morphological characters in conjunction with molecular sequence data, and evaluated in our quarantine facility for efficacy by measuring attack rates, reproductive output and development rates, and for host specificity by testing both close relatives to target hosts and progressively more distantly related species under choice and no-choice conditions.  Objective (2) will address the role of environmental factors such as climate and photoperiod or inherent genetic variability in determining establishment success. Using a parasitoid of tarnished plant bug that established in some regions of the US but not others as the model subject, we will characterize the genetic variability of populations established in the US and their relation to genetic source populations in Europe. Using parasitoids of any or all target pests, we will test the influence of differing environmental factors such as temperature, soil moisture and photoperiod regimes on parasitoid survival in environmental growth chambers and comparative field exposures.  To address objective (3) we will prepare petitions for field release of qualified candidate a gents of all target pests determined to be both effective and safe, based on satisfactory results of evaluation studies.  These will be submitted to technical advisory panels and APHIS, in collaboration with relevant project partners as necessary.  Supplemental research will be conducted to provide additional information if requested by APHIS.  Once permits are received we will participate with cooperators as needed in conducting releases and post-release monitoring of the natural enemies. Where possible the releases will be designed to compare different geographic populations or genetic accessions of the agent for differences in climate adaptation, efficacy or other behavioral characteristics.',\n",

Subobjective 2.2: Determine distribution and impact of adventive or recently released insects on Dalmatian toadflax.  Subobjective 2.3: Release and evaluate new biological control agents targeting arundo and Cape-ivy.  Approach: We will determine the current status of biological control of ice plant by surveying field sites for extant herbivores, including two soft scale species that feed on the leaves, and several parasitic wasps that were introduced to control these scales, over 40 years ago when ice plant was valued as an ornamental. We will determine the feasibility of biocontrol of ice plant and other candidate invasive weeds using new agents through surveys of land managers and other stakeholders, and by scoring weeds according to invasiveness, damage caused, and the likelihood of finding host-specific and efficacious biological control agents in their native ranges. These studies will take phylogenies of the weeds and related native plants into account to determine the feasibility of avoiding nontarget plant damage. We will determine the host ranges of new candidate biological control agents of yellow starthistle, Russian thistle, and French broom through overseas collection by collaborators and no-choice and choice tests in our quarantine laboratory. These studies will also evaluate the biology and impact of candidate agents on targeted weeds. We will determine the ability of the Cape-ivy moth to reproduce and feed on closely-related nontarget plants. Information from host range testing and other studies on new candidate agents will be used to submit applications to the USDA for permits for field release. We will determine the ability of previously-released biological control agents of yellow starthistle, including a seedhead-feeding weevil and a seedhead-galling fly, to damage, survive and reproduce on invasive western U.S. genotypes of yellow starthistle in relation to genotypes from the Greek native range where the agents were originally collected, and from western Mediterranean Europe, where yellow starthistle in the western U.S. originated. These studies will be conducted under no-choice and choice conditions in the greenhouse and in field plantings.  New accessions  of these agents will be collected from western Mediterranean Europe and evaluated for host specificity among close relatives prior to release. At field sites in southern and northern California, we will evaluate the ability of a leaf- and stem-feeding weevil to reduce invasive Dalmatian toadflax plant size and Dalmatian toadflax population size, and determine the degree of recolonization of invaded sites by native plants. We will release and evaluate the impact of a stem-galling wasp and a shoot- and root-feeding armored scale for biological control of the invasive giant grass known as arundo in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and associated river watersheds, where arundo is impacting water resources.  These studies will determine the effect of climate on wasp and scale establishment success.  We will release and evaluate a shoot tip-galling fly for biological control of Cape-ivy at field sites along the California coast. Studies on arundo and Cape-ivy will include evaluations of agent dispersal within field sites, and of integrated biological-chemical control, in which herbicides will be applied and the ability of biocontrol agents to colonize and have impact on regrowth will be determined.',\n",

       " 'Project 1Honey bees provide great benefits to humanity, both in the form of useful hive products such as honey and wax, but even more importantly, as pollinators of a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, oil, and nut crops. Crops that are predominantly pollinated by honeybees have an estimated value of more than $215 billion worldwide, and bees are thought to be responsible for every third bite of food we eat.Disturbingly, the number of honey bee hives in the U.S. has declined sharply in recent decades, from 6 million after World War II, to 2.4 million today. In fact, pollinators are in decline worldwide, creating a pollination deficit for agricultural production. On top of the existing pollinator crisis, since 2006 huge numbers of U.S. honey bee colonies have been lost to a mysterious new malady,  Colony Collapse Disorder  (CCD). This disorder is diagnosed by colony abandonment by adult worker bees. Since the onset of CCD, annual colony losses have doubled in many areas of the U.S., creating a new urgency to the pollination crisis faced in agriculture.There have been many recent studies that have attempted to identify the causes of CCD. Collapsed colonies turn out to have numerous problems, including more diseases (including fungus, bacteria, and viruses), parasitic mites, and pesticide residues. CCD is more likely to occur in colonies found in disturbed urban or agricultural landscapes, rather than in open land habitats with abundant and diverse floral food sources. However, despite all the research, there is still no  silver bullet -- no study to date has been able to pin down the actual cause of CCD. In fact, the only thing researchers can agree on is that CCD must be caused by a combination of several factors.In this project, we propose to test a new hypothesis for CCD. It focuses on the negative effects of two critical factors to bee health--infection with multiple viruses and nutritional stress. We hypothesize that bees under nutritional stress leave the hive in search of food, but are unable to return due to negative effects of being infected with viruses, such as paralysis. When bees fail to return to their hives, their colonies produce new foragers, who may then meet the same fate. This cycle of bees leaving the hive and failing to return could quickly lead to the sudden  disappearance  of worker bees, the diagnostic symptom of CCD.We will use a combination of laboratory and field-based studies to examine the effects of three viruses and nutritional stress on worker bees and their colonies. We will determine whether these two negative factors together can cause the symptoms of CCD. We will be specifically looking for higher loads of viruses, hive abandonment behavior, diagnostic patterns of gene activity, and ultimately, hive death.These findings may lead to changes in apicultural management, such as: more informed virus quarantine practices, colony supplementation with multi-source pollen when bees are nutritionally stressed, allowing bees to forage on crops of high nutritional value after low, and encouraging farmers and beekeepers to use land management practices that increase floral diversity. Project 2Growing evidence suggests that soybean yield is increased when plants are visited by bees (Milfont et al. 2013, Erickson et al. 1978, Erickson et al. 1975). In Brazil, when bees were allowed to visit blooming soybeans, yield increased from 6% to 18% depending upon if the pollinator was a wild or managed bee (Milfont et al. 2013).&middot; A recent two year study in Iowa observed at least 43 species of bees (including honey bees) in soybeans, several with soybean pollen (Gill and O&#39;Neal in review). Often these native, wild bees were more abundant that honey bees. To what extent these bees improve soybean yield in the US is not clear.&middot; Our growing awareness of the benefits of bees to soybean production is coming at a time when both managed and wild bees are suffering declines. For honey bees, colony losses have mounted in the past several decades, and have worsened further in the past decade (National Research Council 2007). Some of these recent losses are associated with a malady known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) that leads to rapid disappearance of adult bees from their hives (Van Engelsdorp et al., 2012).&middot; Corn pollen is of limited nutritional value to honey bees, but soybeans may be a valuable source of forage, since soybean nectar is a major contributor to honey produced in the Midwest (Erickson 1984). For example, soybean nectar-derived honey may contain anti-oxidants that have the potential to positively affect honey bee detoxification systems, allowing them to deal better with environmental toxins (Mao et al. 2013). If soybeans contribute to honey bee health, there may be a win-win for beekeepers and soybean farmers.&middot; Our long term goal is to explore novel ways to improve soybean production that enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture. To achieve this goal, we have two major aims: Determine if 1) soybeans benefit from bees; and, 2) if bees benefit from soybeans? For the first aim, we will determine the amount of yield improvement soybeans experience when exposed to pollinators. For the second aim, we will determine if soybeans provide quality pollen and nectar forage to honey bees.',\n",
       " 'Kentucky has 12.5 million acres of forested land and 467,000 private woodland owners; therefore, forest management approaches are important to the people of the Commonwealth. The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) is a very recent problem; research on its management is still in its infancy. Furthermore, it is the first time a beetle has become such a wide-spread forest pest in Europe and North America in such a short time period. Thus there is little experience on which to base new management strategies. For the moment, the control of the EAB outbreak mainly relies on quarantine regulations and containment activities, through the prevention of artificial movement of the pest; detecting and eradicating outlier populations. The dramatic situation that is occurring in North America has initiated many studies and developed research management plans such as visual surveys, girdled traps and insecticidal control; injections or sprays.',\n",
       " 'The impact of infection by virus-like agents (VLA; includes viruses, viroids, phytoplasmas, and systemic bacterial pathogens) on perennial specialty crop production was recognized long before their etiological agents were confirmed. In Washington State, awareness of the serious nature of virus infections was evident in the foreword to the report of a 1942 disease survey:  The increasing seriousness of the virus disease problem of fruit trees has been a matter of growing concern to orchardists, nurserymen, and investigators  (Reeves, 1943). The critical roles of grafting onto woody indicators for pathogen detection, and the need for replacement of infected trees with virus-tested trees were also discussed by Reeves (1943). It was demonstrated that aggressive tree removal in an effort to control Western X disease in Washington orchards was an effective tool to halt the increase in the numbers of infected trees in a defined growing region (Blodgett et al., 1949). To replace the infected trees that were removed, a reliable source of non-diseased trees was needed. This marked the genesis of the currently existing fruit tree foundation and certification programs that have ensured a continuous flow of virus-tested planting stock into nursery and production planting schemes over the past seventy years, which has led to a substantial reduction in economic loss from VLA infections in specialty crops.Today, the ability to provide virus-tested planting stock of vegetatively propagated specialty crops has become increasingly complex. The collective industries no longer depend on a few selections to support the industry. For example, the Clean Plant Center Northwest (CPCNW) at Washington State University receives an average of 139 temperate climate fruit tree selections each year for introduction and virus-testing (Eastwell, unpublished observation). The same intensive movement to establish niche markets with new selections is occurring in the grape and hop industries as well. Propagation source material originating from domestic and foreign locations is screened for VLAs before they are propagated and distributed throughout the industry. It takes many years for a single virus-tested plant to be expanded to an economically relevant planting that provides adequate product for marketing and sales initiatives. To meet the demand to have new distinctive product available in the market sooner, tremendous pressure is placed on programs to provide this service expeditiously. Rapid access to productive new clones is essential in allowing U.S. producers to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Consequently, the initial virus testing must be completed in a timely fashion. Similarly, much of the material distributed from the programs providing the virus-testing service enables plant breeders and developers to provide their product to foreign markets. Over the period 2011 to 2013, 9,914 out of the total of 36,979 or 27% of the distributions from the fruit tree program were to recipients outside of the U.S. Testing procedures used for the development of plant material must therefore be accepted by the regulatory agencies with authority in the recipient state or country. The goal of this project is to address issues associated with the demand for rapid detection and elimination of VLAs from planting stock. Overall, the three perennial specialty crops represented in this project constitute a large segment of U.S. agriculture. Nationally, the farm-gate value of these specialty crops are $11,162 million for temperate climate fruit and nut trees, $6,158 million for grapes and $249 million for hops (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2014). The ultimate goal of the CPCNW is to assist the industries it serves by providing propagation material as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards possible for plant health and quarantine security. Research is conducted to help achieve this goal.In addition to the vegetatively propagated perennial crops, the seed industry is also a critical component of U.S. agriculture. In 2012, the U.S. exported seed valued at $1,522 million, of which $70 million was produced in Washington State (Mertz et al., 2013). The CPCNW provides seed testing services for viruses to support Washington State quarantine regulations governing seeds for planting in the state and to satisfy requirements for products to be exported from Washington to many other states and countries. Two major seed crops serviced by the CPCNW are beans and peas with a combined production value of $174 million in Washington State (Mertz et al., 2013). Many other seed crops are tested on a sporadic basis.',\n",

       " \"CORE SUMMARY The Mutant Mouse Core (Core B) is an essential core that will be used extensively by all three projects. Given the complex interplay between different inhibitory receptors on multiple cell types, the only way one can dissect these critical disease-related biological questions in vivo is with sophisticated mouse models. A significant strength of this PPG application is the unique `surgical' tools that it will utilize, specifically PD1/LAG3 floxed mice combined with a unique collection of lineage-specific, and in some instances temporally controlled, Cre recombinase-expressing mice. These tools will give us unprecedented control and thus insight into PD1/LAG3 synergy and function in multiple cell types. AIM 1: To provide the PD1/LAG3 mutant mice required for the PPG. The Core will be administered from UPitt, with the majority of the mutant mouse breeding and procurement outsourced to Taconic under Murine Pathogen Free barrier conditions identical to the majority of their commercial breeding practices. Taconic will deliver mice to all research sites on a rotating weekly basis using their conventional delivery mechanism, thereby avoiding lengthy quarantine. AIM 2: To generate new mutant mouse combinations. The Core will generate of new mutant mouse combinations that introduce different genetic elements such as new Cre stains and TCR transgenes. PPG Interactions: Core B will support Project 1, Project 2 and Project 3 extensively, and interact with Core A to provide easy access to breeding, shipping and genotyping data. Core B will also perform additional crosses to generate any stain combinations required by the projects. Core B will interact with Core A to provide easy access to breeding, shipping and genotyping data, and ongoing monitoring.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-human primates (NHPs) occupy a vital niche in basic and translational studies of higher brain function, representing a model system that allows for direct, high-resolution measurements and manipulations of brain mechanisms in the context of complex behaviors. At a time when other institutions are downsizing NHP research because of cost and other constraints, the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) is making a strong, lasting commitment to this research. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve animal welfare and occupational human health, with the added simultaneous benefit of accelerating basic and translation research in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders that affect high-level brain function. This is accomplished by creating a shared NHP Neurophysiology and Behavior Facility (NHP-NBF) that will provide enhanced group socialization enrichment, food enrichment, quarantine, and housing areas. Work in the NHP- NBF will coalesce multiple well-funded investigators with complementary research programs that examine high-level functions of the primate brain, including perception, cognition, action and decision-making. Importantly, G20 renovation support will substantially enhance animal welfare at Penn by providing: (1) a dedicated socialization enrichment room; (2) a dedicated food preparation area for the primate environmental enrichment program; (3) a dedicated NHP quarantine room that will allow coordinated importation and acclimation of animals and improve safety for staff and NHPs; and (4) an additional housing room to decompress current housing rooms, thereby enhancing staff safety and to help meet the capacity demand of funded research. The G20-funded enhancements in the enrichment program are particularly important for the NHPs in the facility because, unlike animals involved in many other types of research, many of the NHPs have very long residencies in the facility and are expected to perform challenging behavioral tasks on a regular basis. Reducing stress and improving the overall well-being of NHPs via enhanced social and food enrichment programs provide substantial value to the animals and to Penn's research programs by increasing the animal's health, longevity, and productivity. The renovated areas will meet or exceed modern requirements, as stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILAR, 2011) and as interpreted by AAALAC, the USDA and OLAW, and is complementary to an overall building project that will reduce energy utilization.\",\n",

       " '\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemophilia is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in the clotting factor protein factor VIII (FVIII) (hemophilia A, HA) or factor IX (FIX) (hemophilia B, HB) present in 1 in 5,000 males worldwide. Small amounts of clotting factor protein (>1% of normal) in the circulation provide substantial improvement of the disease phenotype. Preclinical studies of gene-based therapies for HB in dog models provided the basis for ongoing clinical trials using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. These ongoing clinical trials demonstrated sustained expression of therapeutic levels of FIX. However, 80% of all hemophilia is due to FVIII deficiency, hemophilia A (HA). Gene therapy for HA presents three distinct challenges: (1) intrinsic properties of human FVIII (hFVIII) make it difficult to express compared to other proteins of similar size (2) the large size of the FVIII cDNA is prone to rearrangements which hampers AAV production and (3) high rates of anti-FVIII antibody (inhibitor) formation in patients following protein therapy. In earlier studies, AAV delivery of canine FVIII in HA dogs resulted in long-term dose-dependent expression of cFVIII that significantly improves the disease phenotype, however, the dose of AAV to achieve these goals remains relatively high. This high vector dose may be an obstacle to translating to humans since humans may have pre-existing immunity to AAV and thus may have an immune response to the AAV capsid upon AAV vector administration. We recently identified two novel human FVIII modifications that overcome the challenges of packaging the FVIII cDNA into AAV vectors and expressing hFVIII protein. First, a unique codon-optimized hFVIII DNA sequence expresses higher than wild type hFVIII but also packages more efficiently into AAV vectors. AAV packaging of this codon-optimized cDNA sequence results in a homogenous AAV vector that has a two-fold higher yield than wild type hFVIII. Second, variants of an intracellular protease cleavage recognition site in the hFVIII protein confer increased secretion and biological activity. We hypothesize that AAV delivery of these hFVIII variants will be therapeutic at lower AAV doses than native hFVIII, with no increases in immunogenicity over the currently used B-domain deleted FVIII constructs. The goal of this proposal is to determine the efficacy and safety of AAV delivery of these novel variants of hFVIII in unique hemophilia A mouse models (Specific Aim 1) and hemophilia A dog models (Specific Aim 2) that are both tolerant to human FVIII. These studies have the potential for success in reducing the AAV vector dose which will have a profound impact on avoiding the anti-AAV immune responses and on the long-term efficacy after AAV-mediated gene delivery of FVIII which will provide the necessary advances to translate this gene therapy approach for hemophilia A into the clinic.',\n",
       " \"SummaryPrecise metabolic phenotyping depends significantly on the health status of animal subjects. Traditionally, the“Animal Care Core” has focused on providing stable housing and husbandry and microbiological testing tominimize the influence of exogenous factors that could impact phenotyping results. However, an increasedunderstanding of the microbiome and its potentials impact on physiologic processes has prompted the “AnimalCare Core” to establish strong ties with Dr. Andrew Goodman (Associate Professor of MicrobialPathogenesis), a microbiome and gnotobiotics expert at Yale. Under co-directors Macy and Goodman, thecore will become the “Microbiome and Animal Care Core” to reflect expansion of its mission to includecompositional and functional analysis of the microbiome. Assessing the impact of microbiome in the context ofa metabolic phenotype is an important, if not transformative step in unraveling the mechanistic processes thatdefine a metabolic phenotype. The rationale for consolidating these core functions within the Animal Care Corewas discussed and approved by the NIDDK Program Staff. The Core will continue to provide state-of-the-arthusbandry, health care, quarantine, testing, and procedure space and utilize its expedited quarantine programthat has supported the MMPC during the past 12 years. This approach has successfully decreased thequarantine time and allowed phenotyping to begin while animals are within quarantine, allowing animals to bestudied at younger ages and minimizing costs associated with the phenotyping process. The microbiomecomponent of the core will advance metabolic phenotyping by offering: 1) compositional profiling andmetagenomic characterization of the microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract in subject animals and theirwildtype littermates; 2) metabolic phenotyping of subject animals, their wildtype littermates, and wildtypegermfree controls after each group has been exposed to broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktails; 3) fecalmicrobiome transplantation services into germfree recipient animals, followed by metabolic and microbiomephenotyping, to provide definitive evidence of the ability of a subject animal microbiome to confer a metabolicimpact on its host. The Microbiome and Animal Care Core will continue to utilize dedicated biocontainmenthousing and procedure space and will add fully operational, state-of-the art gnotobiotics and microbiomeprofiling capabilities in place in the Goodman laboratory. In parallel, the Animal Resource center also operatesa well-established gnotobiotic housing facility adjacent to Dr. Goodman's facility in which there is a history ofsharing resources for operating these two facilities, thereby adding capacity and redundancy to support theYale MMPC.\",\n",
       " \"\\ufeff   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, in general, and Escherichia coli (E. coli), the leading cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections, in specific, is a common occurrence; however, the development of new antibiotics to treat these bacteria is hindered by the strong permeability barrier posed by the outer membrane (OM). Understanding changes that occur to this barrier in differing environmental conditions will inform antibiotic discovery strategies that lead to new clinically relevant antibiotics. The objectve of this proposal is to elucidate changes occurring to the E. coli OM during nutrient limiting conditions that may affect the cell's resistance to harsh conditions with the long-term goal of understanding bacterial stress responses and the ways they can be manipulated. OM permeability to anionic detergents such as SDS serves as a good model for OM antibiotic permeability in cells will low metabolic activity. Preliminary data demonstrate that exponentially growing cells, carbon-limited cells, and nitrogen-limited cells are all resistant to high concentrations of SDS; however, in exponential phase, this resistance is based on the presence of efflux pumps suggesting that the SDS crosses the OM while, in stationary phase, the resistance is independent of efflux suggesting the membrane is strengthen to decrease its permeability. Furthermore, the stationary phase resistance can occur through at least two pathways, an rpoS-dependent pathway in carbon-limited conditions and an rpoS-independent pathway in nitrogen-limited conditions. Neither of these pathways involves the non- essential envelope stress responses nor the nitrogen starvation regulators, rpoN and ntrC, suggesting that the pathways are highly novel. Therefore, this proposal will address through Aims with the follow goals the hypothesis that changes occur to the OM during stationary phase making the OM more resistant to detergents and that both rpoS-dependent and rpoS-independent pathways can induce these changes.  Specific Aim 1: Determine if changes in OM physiology occur between exponential, C-limited stationary, and N-limited stationary phase Specific Aim 2: Determine what rpoS-dependent and rpoS-independent pathways lead to decreased SDS  permeability during stationary phase Through completion of these Aims, any changes to OM lipopolysaccharide modification, phospholipid levels or localization, and/or OM protein expression or levels will be elucidated. In addition, through transposon mutagenesis and Tn-Seq approaches, the pathways that lead to decreased OM SDS permeability in stationary phase will be determined. Understanding of the OM changes that are occurring in nutrient limiting conditions may lead to improvements in antibiotic discovery strategies that identify antibiotics effective for Gram-negative bacteria in varying environmental conditions.\",\n",

Iceland's dynamic landscape provides a natural laboratory of fast-paced changes shaped by glaciers, volcanoes, and severe oceanic storms. The focus of this project is marine stickleback fish that have colonized multiple freshwater lakes, and thus have evolved in waters differing dramatically in clarity. The research examines sensory system evolution to ask if eyes get better at seeing in murky water, or if fish instead evolve better senses of smell and touch. The project identifies how genes and environment contribute to sensory system adaptation in different environments. The project gives young scientists cutting-edge training in multiple disciplines, generating a scientific workforce to help deal with large-scale environmental issues our society faces. Outreach efforts in museums and schools educate young and old alike on evolutionary changes driven by environmental change.This research studies adaptation of sight, smell, and touch in extreme sensory environments. It assesses how differences in sensory systems affect survival from predators in murky glacial and clear lakes. The research reveals how genetic variation and gene expression differ, and reconstructs the history of colonization and the extent of parallel evolution of these traits in multiple lakes. It also uses transplant experiments to evaluate the extent of plasticity in sensory systems. This research combines the phenotypic and functional with the genetic dimensions of biodiversity, all within a historical context. Each dimension informs the other to help understand sensory adaptation.\",\n",
       " \"Microbial processes in marine sediments play a major role in the global nitrogen cycle. Because the presence of nitrogen compounds dissolved in seawater largely controls biological growth, understanding how the sedimentary nitrogen budget changes with altered circulation, acidity, and biological productivity is of critical importance to predict oceanic function in future climate scenarios. Surprisingly, we do not know definitively if nitrogen exchange between sediments and the water column is in balance, and if not, how it varies over time and space. We do know that two bacterially mediated chemical reactions are primarily responsible for removing nitrogen from marine ecosystems by converting biologically usable forms of dissolved nitrogen back to nitrogen gas (N2) that is not generally available for biological production. These reactions are called denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox); the latter operating only where oxygen is zero. This project will investigate a third reaction, called dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA), which competes directly with anammox to limit N2 production and the consequent  loss  of nitrogen, thus retaining nitrogen for use in marine ecosystems. The role of DNRA has not been fully explored and quantifying this reaction could help evaluate the overall nitrogen balance in ocean systems. The researchers here will use novel experimental reactors that contain collected marine sediments and, by varying environmental conditions (pH, temperature, oxygen, organic carbon), will discover and quantify what controls rates of DNRA, denitrification, and anammox in sediments. This will provide a direct test and further development of theoretical sedimentary nitrogen models that can be used to predict possible changes in the global nitrogen cycle resulting with various future climate scenarios. Two graduate students will participate in the research and collaborations with the Maine Coastal Observing Alliance (MCOA) and the Gulf of Maine Institute (GOMI), as well as the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP) will generate minority student involvement and enhanced outreach activity.This project uses thermodynamic calculations and empirical evidence as a basis to evaluate the ratio of available organic carbon (C) to nitrate (NO3-) as a key controlling factor of nitrogen redox partitioning; with higher ratios believed to favor dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA) over N2 production. The investigator's theoretical model predicts rapid and reversible transitions between DNRA and N2 production over relatively small changes in C/NO3-. This suggests that partitioning could be sensitive to seasonal and possibly inter-annual differences in organic C deposition as well as processes that control nitrate flux to the sediments such as water column stratification. Quantitative relationships between sedimentary C/NO3- and nitrogen partitioning remain poorly defined, and a number of other factors including T, H2S, and Fe(II), are known to influence N partitioning. This study will investigate the hypothesis that relationships between nitrogen redox partitioning and C/NO3-, and by extension H2S/NO3-, are predicted by the proposed theoretical sedimentary nitrogen model. Experiments will varying NO3 fluxes while providing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and 13C-labelled detritus as electron donors, and measure transformation rates of 15NO3- to 15NH4+ and 29/30N2 in thin disc reactors to determine rates and pathways of DNRA and N2 production. The proposed integration of these experiments with a theoretically-based biogeochemical model will develop a quantifiable and testable understanding of the marine nitrogen cycle. This study should provide a major advance that could be broadly applied to quantitatively predict the sedimentary balance between nitrogen retention and loss across marine ecosystems.\",\n",
       " 'Over the last few decades, our understanding of how DNA is organized in the nucleus has evolved from a ?sack? full of chromosomes to a highly ordered structure. Despite the growing evidence for conserved and adaptive patterns in how the genome is organized in the nucleus, there are few studies exploring the relationship of genome evolution and its organization in 3-dimensions. This is partly due to the way that genome evolution is currently perceived, where genomic sequences are treated as long linear molecules rather than the highly folded chromosomes that actually exist inside the eukaryotic cell. In collaboration with Dr. Meng-Chao Yao, at Academia Sinica, this project will work with Tokophrya sp. (an unusual microbial eukaryote with ?gene-sized? chromosomes and a complex life cycle) as the study organism to explore patterns of evolution and how evolution is reflected in its nuclear architecture.Currently, there are few studies exploring the evolution of the eukaryotic genome beyond its sequence. Through the use of molecular tools such as qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization, the project will be able to estimate the actual abundance of different ?gene-sized? chromosomes, their relative expression, and their position as well. Coupling these physical properties of Tokophrya with bioinformatic approaches to explore patterns of molecular evolution such as pairwise distances and codon bias will provide the basis for a strong comparative study. Previous work in microbial eukaryotes has helped to demonstrate some ?universal? patterns in nuclear architecture, such as the organization of DNA into DNA rich regions surrounding DNA poor corridors. Further work with divergent organisms such as Tokophrya sp. will provide intimate details about relationship between molecular evolution and how evolutionary forces participate in the non-random organization of the 3-dimensional genome.

       " 'This research project seeks to understand the factors that encourage success in computer-supported peer production - the form of online collaborative organization used to create public information goods like Wikipedia and Linux.  Why do some peer production systems mobilize large communities of contributors and create valuable information goods while most do not?  One answer for this challenging question is that success-related factors may change significantly as a collaborative organization grows, such that conditions that encouraged explosive growth in the beginning may prevent further growth later on. This work will provide actionable insights for initiators and managers of online collaborative organizations, informing the design and management of distributed collaboration across different topic domains at different stages of project development. It will also produce freely licensed and publicly available computational research systems and datasets that will enable reproducible research and the dissemination of the new techniques developed by the research.  Peer production and related forms of online collaboration in virtual communities have diffused widely in software production, knowledge management, cultural production, and education. Another sign of its significance is the fact that a growing number of organizations look to distributed collaboration managed through virtual and volunteer communities as a source of innovation and customer support.This research uses longitudinal comparative analysis of populations of peer production communities to elaborate a novel and transformative science of pathways to effective collaborative organization. In doing so, it will extend the rich traditions of sociotechnical systems research and organization science on these topics.  This empirical work will explore three central facets of peer production: (1) the relationship between participation equality and growth; (2) the extent to which community effectiveness is limited by competition for volunteer resources; and (3) the role of social interaction and coordination in productive collaboration. In every case, empirical predictions will be developed from prior work and tested using trace data from a large population of peer production wikis. The research will then explore how the observed relationships may diminish or even reverse as communities grow. The findings will become the basis for a broader theory of collaborative organization that explains how key drivers of mobilization in nascent groups differ systematically from those in established communities.',\n",
       " '1606062 PI: GravesTitle: INFEWS N/P/H2O: Fundamentals of N2/O2 plasma and heterogeneous catalysisThis project aims to advance air plasma technology in order to substantially reduce human perturbation to the global nitrogen cycle. The focus will be on establishing the scientific foundation necessary to efficiently couple non-equilibrium nitrogen/oxygen plasmas with heterogeneous catalysts in order to efficiently form nitric oxide (NO).  If efficient air plasmas can create nitric oxide (NO), this can be readily transformed to nitogen oxide (NO2) and then to nitric acid (HNO3) by water absorption. Nitric acid could be used to trap otherwise fugitive ammonia (NH3), created when bacteria degrade organic waste. The ammonia is trapped at low pH as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), thus greatly increasing the nitrogen value of the organic fertilizer and avoiding the damaging environmental effects of the ammonia emission. The technology would be especially promising because the plasma can be powered by electricity that could be generated in a distributed, renewable fashion at the location of the waste generation, such as the farm. Rather than compete with conventional Haber-Bosch NH3 manufacturing technology, this technology seeks to reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers made in centralized plants far from their use. Non-equilibrium plasmas can act as a homogeneous catalyst by lowering the activation energy of nitrogen dissociation. This process can be substantially improved by the addition of heterogeneous catalysts, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The proposed project will employ radical beam - surface studies under high vacuum and modulated beam mass spectrometry to study radical-surface catalytic interactions for a range of metal and metal oxide materials and surface temperatures. The data from these studies will be used to develop parameterized site balance models that can provide insights into near-atmospheric pressure studies of non-equilibrium nitrogen/oxygen plasmas in the presence of catalytic surfaces. The successful implementation of plasmas for this application could help motivate studies of other plasma electro-catalytic technologies. In addition to training graduate students, the PI plans to recruit undergraduate students from programs that engage women and minorities. An outreach program to middle school students involving plasma demonstration devices is also proposed.',\n",

The infrastructure includes control of virtual network functions such as virtual router/firewall combinations, traffic flow segregation in metropolitan area networks, and integration of threat intelligence from other data sources using network traffic analytics.  The overarching goals are to 1) enable new network functionality to protect networks from malware and denial of service attacks; 2) improve visibility and response time to security threats, 3) quarantine infected computers, and 4) contribute new open source software to the community for integration with a wide range of applications.',\n",
       " 'Objective(s): To maintain the ARS Biological Control Documentation Center for storage and retrieval of information on invertebrate and microbial biological control agents of invertebrate, weed and microbial pests. Specific objectives are to modernize the current ROBO database and bring data in ROBO up-to-date, and to conduct a pilot study as to centralization of biological control environmental assessment activities for ARS.  Approach: Develop and test user-friendly, object-oriented PC data entry systems for importation of foreign invertebrates and microbial biological control agents; (2) for domestic quarantine consignment, shipment and release of imported invertebrate biological control agents and for the field release of imported microbial biological control agents; and (3) for the non-quarantine culture, shipment, release and recolonization of introduced biological control agents.  Complete necessary programming to import data from the existing free tables in Oracle into working tables of the new ROBO system, using existing 1981-84 ROBO data; develop software to import ROBO data from PC data files at remote locations into Oracle on the GRIN Sun Computer; maintain data in Oracle on the central database by BCDC; and develop user-friendly query system for availability on the World Wide Web.

       " 'Objective(s): The goals of our project plan are to conduct foundational research to create the knowledge base necessary to develop innovative control methods and IPM strategies, and to conduct applied research to produce information and products that improve pest control in tropical agriculture. The four major objectives of our program are:  Objective 1: Model pest invasion pathways, and investigate the genomics/genetics, physiology/behavior, population dynamics, biology/ecology, and natural enemies of tropical and subtropical fruit flies and other invasive pests to develop technologies to control (contain, suppress, and eradicate) these pests in Hawaii and the Pacific, the U.S. mainland, and elsewhere.  1A: Build an analysis of emerging tephritid fruit fly genomes, including linkage mapping, uniform and consistent gene structural and functional annotation, and comparative genomic analysis.  1B: Conduct surveys on coffee berry borer (CBB) distribution and abundance on Hawaii Island to provide a baseline for a predictive model that integrates GIS, pest insect population dynamics, host plant phenology, weather data and grower practices to drive area-wide management of CBB on Hawaii Island.  Objective 2: Determine physiological, genetic, and biological factors limiting the effectiveness of the sterile insect technique (SIT) and natural enemies in control and eradication of fruit flies and other tropical plant pests of quarantine significance.  2A: Improve the effectiveness of mass reared fruit flies for SIT by quantifying the impact of colony infusion on incorporating wild genetics into the SIT colony, and correlating fly performance with genomic markers. 2B: Investigate parasitoid-fruit fly host interactions from the molecular to the field level.  Objective 3: To increase export of tropical fruits and vegetables, improve attractants and trapping systems for surveillance and detection, and develop lures, baits, and reduced risk pesticides for area-wide IPM of fruit flies  Approach: Hypothesis 1A: Tephritid genomes have a core set of genes that are related to their proliferation as pests world-wide. If we have trouble generating crosses from a particular species or have issues generating genomic DNA, other species could be sequenced.  Approach 1B: Collect baseline data on distribution and abundance of Coffee Berry Borer and associated environmental and climatic data. Then use GIS techniques to produce a region-wide assessment of infestation and economic impact. If this does not work, surveys can be replaced with grower-collected data.    Approach 2A: Combine genetic, proteomic and phenotypic data into a synthetic analysis. If portions experiments fail or cannot be integrated, publish portions independently.   Approach 2B: Examine tephritid host-parasitoid biology across levels of biological organization to allow integration of foundational knowledge benefiting classical biological control of tephritids. If international releases are impeded by regulatory issues, field work in Hawaii will be done.   Hypothesis 3A: Solid male lure wafers with solid insecticidal tape are just as effective, but more convenient and safer to handle than current liquid lure-insecticide formulations used for fruit fly detection programs. If data are inconclusive, chemical analyses of weathered dispensers from trials will at least provide “use pattern” and formulation data for future trials.  Hypothesis 3B: Generic combination SPLAT-MAT-spinosad-methyl eugenol/cue-lure mixture will perform as well as Min-U-Gel with naled and ME and C-L separately for fruit fly control/eradication. If the sprayable mixtures are too expensive, recommend addition of small amounts of cue-lure or raspberry ketone to STATIC-spinosad-ME as part of a tank mix.  Hypothesis 3C: A binay identified single compound lure. In cases where low populations are encountered, trials will be shifted to other fields or other time of year where higher populations are present.   Hypothesis 4A: Mass trapping using a plant-odor lure, male lure and protein baits can create areas of low pest prevalence (ALPP) in commercial crops and reduce the risk of a mating pair in a consignment when combined with a second measure such as a (less than 99.9986% effective) quarantine treatment. Alternatively, investigate the effects of other independent measures such as poor host status and quarantine treatments.  Approach 4B: Develop a biologically-based mathematical model of tephritid traps in a landscape that allows formal quantification of trap network sensitivity. Hypothesis 4C: Current preharvest foliar insecticides being used in IPM systems against other fruit and vegetable pests (e.g., spotted wing drosophila and Asian citrus psyllid) in California and Florida are sufficient to meet quarantine requirements for fruit flies when introduced into Florida and California. Alternatives are to use current practices of either malathion protein bait or GF-120 sprays.ry male attractant system identified with sweetpotato vine borer populations in Vietnam will provide significantly greater male catch in Hawaii populations than male catch in traps baited with an initiall',\n",
       " 'This project is a renewal of a Hatch-funded project to generate online identification keys for microscopic nematodes, using multifocal video images as its main source of taxonomic guide data, rather than expert jargon or a text-based search strategy. The goals of the present project are to complete collection and identification of nematodes from a maximal diversity of crops and agricultural soils at UC sites in California; to transfer image acquisition and databasing from its present HDTV format to 4K video standards, and to add three additional major groups of microscopic organisms (tardigrades, cyanobacteria and eukaryotic soil algae). The system will be optimized for use by different target audiences including farm advisors, extension specialists, growers and students of agricultural sciences, by conducting training and testing sessions at venues such as the annual UC ANR California Nematology Workshop, Discovery Day and Earth Day events at the Riverside Metropolitan Museum, and undergraduate research lab sessions of my annual upper division Invertebrate Zoology and Biology of Nematodes course at UCR. This will enable more researchers, growers, reserve managers, quarantine specialists and farm advisers to identify a greater variety of California&#39;s nematodes, tardigrades, cyanobacteria and soil algae faster in a wider range of agricultural and natural ecosystems. The online identification tools and their underlying database engine will be transferred from its current Python-derived source code to a Flash-based interface, in order to enable easier addition of the new modules for tardigrades and both types of soil algae, as well as facilitating future updates of the main browsers and operating systems used by most members of the public.',\n",
       " 'The most recent comprehensive evaluation of the United States environmental horticulture industry reported economic contributions of $147.8 billion in output, 1,964,339 jobs, $95.1 billion in value added, $64.3 billion in labor income, and $6.9 billion in indirect business taxes (Hall et al. 2005). Nursery and greenhouse crops alone account for $16 billion of the United States economy with $4.65 billion contributed by nursery growers reporting over $10,000 in sales (USDA 2007) and the sector provided 261,408 jobs with a value of $18.1 billion (Hall et al. 2005). As in other areas of agriculture, insect pest management programs are crucial to the production of healthy nursery stock, but despite the industry&#39;s considerable contribution to the United States economy, research on nursery crop pests lags behind in effort and funding focused on vegetables and row crops. The complex nature of the nursery industry due to the large number of plant species grown in individual nurseries is part of what makes nursery pest management research challenging. As such, pests that have large economic impacts, attack multiple, high production genera and are quarantine restricted are important targets for research. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs that incorporate host plant resistance, cultural, behavioral and chemical controls are more sustainable than programs focusing on only one of these techniques. A key element in developing successful IPM programs is a thorough understanding of insect behavior and chemical ecology. By understanding pest behaviors and identifying the chemicals influencing those behaviors, pest managers can target pests at vulnerable stages in their life cycle and manipulate pest populations so they can be more effectively controlled. In 2009, the Southern Nursery Integrated Pest Management Working Group, sponsored by a grant from the Southern Region IPM Center, established the Pest Management Strategic Plan for Container and Field-Produced Nursery Crops (Adkins et al. 2009). The working group consisted of a team of researchers and nursery owners. They listed the following research priorities for the nursery industries in Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, all of which support the need for research in the areas relating to: (1)making IPM profitable and viable for nursery crop production, (2) investigating whole systems approaches to pest management and (3) development of conservation biological control tactics, such as habitat manipulation with flowering plants, to increase the abundance, diversity, and efficacy of naturally occurring predators and parasitoids. To support these strategic goals, we will focus resources on the study of arthropod pests that impact a wide range of high value woody ornamental crops. These pests may include spider mites, scales, wood borers, fire ants and other pests each of which affect a wide range of trees and shrubs.Two objectives will be investigated in the current Evans-Allen proposal :(1) Investigation of life history and behavioral traits of ornamental pests and associates to improve management and (2) Investigation of lower risk products for use against ornamental pests.',\n",

Western cherry fruit fly adult emergence will be compared from soils with varying moisture and cover to determine whether fruit fly infestations in orchards can emanate from trees located in unmanaged habitats with dry soil surfaces.  1D. Data from differential scanning calorimetry and laboratory assays will provide estimates of metabolic thermal limits for codling moth, apple maggot, and western cherry fruit fly to determine the liklihood for these pests to establish and spread in new geographies.  1E. A CRISPR/Cas9 gene knock out system will be used to determine the function of proteins key to codling moth reproduction and development in support of work to develop species-specific behavioral and physiological modifying analogs for use in pest management.  1F.

       " 'Objective(s): Objective 1:  Develop biological control agents for invasive weeds (such as Russian thistle, Russian knapweed, common crupina, and invasive Rubus species) through the identification, isolation, efficacy testing, and host-specificity evaluation of candidate plant pathogens (such as Colletotrichum salsolae, Phoma exigua, and Ramularia crupinae). [NP304, Component 2, Problem Statement 2B3]  Sub-objective 1A - Isolation and identification.   Sub-objective 1B - Evaluation of pathogen efficacy.  Sub-objective 1C - Evaluation of disease reaction among non-target and target species.  Sub-objective 1D - Develop and submit a proposal for release that describes the importance of the target weed as a pest and the efficacy and safety of a candidate pathogen.   Sub-objective 1E - Participate with cooperators in release and post-release monitoring of the pathogen (under permit from state and federal regulators).   Objective 2:  Develop methods to rapidly screen and identify plant pathogens that have a high probability of being useful, safe, and effective as biological control agents for high priority invasive weeds (such as Russian thistle, Russian knapweed, common Crupina, and invasive Rubus species), in that they have the desired properties of high virulence and pathogenicity to the target weed, yet are sufficiently host specific that they are not a threat to beneficial and native organisms (such as crop and rare plants).  [NP304, Component 2, Problem Statement 2B3]   Sub-objective 2A - Refine and improve statistical approaches to risk assessments that combine disease response data with quantitative plant relationship data based upon molecular characteristics.   Sub-objective 2B - Refine and apply available protocols in microscopy, physiology, and bioinformatics to improve risk assessments and clarify results of tests in Objective 1, particularly concerning non-target plant species reactions.  Approach: Exotic pathogens will be collected from symptomatic target weeds in countries where they are native, evaluated for their potential using standard plant pathology methods, and identified using both classical morphological characters and molecular sequence data. The primary target weeds will be Canada thistle, Russian thistle, Russian knapweed, yellowstarthistle, and medusahead. Other targets include, but are not limited to: Carduus thistles, milk thistle, knapweeds, common crupina, whitetop, broadleaved pepperweed, invasive blackberry, swallow-worts, cheat grass, teasel, and field and hedge bindweed. Pathogens will be evaluated for the risk associated with intended release into ecosystems containing economically and ecologically important North American plant species. Risk will be evaluated, in quarantine, based on disease reaction of species related to the target weed from a test-plant list reviewed and modified according to recommendations of regulators at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In evaluating disease reaction, protocols for improved risk assessment will be developed and used. These include an advanced statistical analysis that incorporates disease reaction data with genetic relatedness, from DNA sequences, of species on the test-plant list. Output from these analyses will be best linear unbiased predictors of the disease reaction of each species. Other protocols incorporating advancements in histology, microscopy, and genetics will also be used to improve understanding of risk and non-target plant disease responses. Pathogens determined to have an adequately narrow host range will be proposed for release in the U.S.A. Proposals for release of the pathogen will be developed for review by the Technical Advisory Group for Biological Control Agents of Weeds, and subsequent development of an Environmental Assessment, declaration of Finding of No Significant Impact and issuance of federal and state permits for release. Inoculum of the pathogen will be prepared in sufficient quantity for release, and target weeds will be inoculated in the field under conditions that favor disease development and establishment. Establishment and spread of pathogens will be monitored in the field by recording disease symptoms on the target weed and re-isolating the pathogens. Damage to target weed populations and environmental factors important in pathogen establishment, efficacy and spread, will be measured.',\n",
       " 'Subterranean termites and kudzu bugs are exotic invasive pests in the U.S. Both have significant economic and environment impacts on the urban and agriculture environments.Subterranean termites are the single greatest economic pest in the United States. These termites cause billions of dollars in damage each year to homes, historical structures and commercial buildings, as well as to forest and horticultural plants (Rust and Su 2012). Termites evolved as decomposers of dead plant materials and contribute to the nutrient turnover of soil (Holt and Lepage 2000), but rapid urbanization and deforestation changed their habitats and turned them into serious pests in urban, agriculture and forest environments. The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera, Rhinotermitidae), alone was accountable for $1.5 billion annually in damage in 1994 (Su). The control cost, although high compared to those for other household pests, is considered relatively small in comparison with the value of a house and the damage potential by termites (Su and Scheffrahn 1998). In the southern states, there is an 80 - 100% chance of a home being attacked by termites in the absence of termite control measures (Mauldin 1986). Successful management of subterranean termites has been a challenge because of termites&#39; cryptic living style, unique social structure, large populations, tenacious foraging habits, unpredictable foraging patterns, and most importantly, unlimited food and moisture supplies in the urban and forest ecosystems (Potter 1997, Su and Scheffrahn 1998, Henderson 2001). Termite control carries the highest risk for the pest control industry of all categories in urban pest management. The termination of USDA  Operation Termite Full Stop  program (1998-2007) further aggravates our battle with Formosan subterranean termites in Alabama. This is partially attributed to the deposit of tons of termite-infested wood debris from neighboring states to Alabama in the wake of hurricanes and partially to declining in support for termite research and control program. In recent years, we have experienced an increasing number of calls from Historic Structure Organizations, the Society of Arboriculture and the Forest Society about Formosan termites endangering historic buildings and destroying living trees and ornamentals. Termites are also expanding their territory to infest horticulture crops, gardens and landscapes, causing economic loss and affecting the environment. Questions remain to be answered about what are the mechanism of their successful adaptations in urban and forest ecosystems, and what are the strategies and mechanisms in combating soil-borne harmful microorganisms and surviving standard termiticide treatments. For these reasons, termite research is a high priority.The kudzu bug (Heteroptera: Plataspididae: Megacopta cribraria F.) is an exotic insect. It was first discovered in the southeastern U.S. in 2009 and has now established across much of the Southeast (Gardner et al. 2013). Kudzu bugs have become a serious pest threatening soybean, vegetable, and horticultural producers. The kudzu bug problem is also exacerbated by its abundance in kudzu-infested urban areas where it has become a nuisance in homes and buildings. In addition to the severe crop loss caused to soybean, M. cribraria infestation also impacts international trade and commerce. After inspections of containers revealed dead kudzu bugs in shipments of frozen chicken meat paste, some Central American countries issued quarantine of products from Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina with a fear of accidental introductions in contaminated shipments there. As the pest has established in all the 67 counties in Alabama, the threat posed by this invasive insect species is rapidly increasing and no effective control strategies other than chemical insecticides are currently available to help soybean farmers manage this exotic insect in the region. As a consequence, farmers have continued to rely heavily on insecticide sprays to control kudzu bug. This increased use of chemical pesticides can result in the development of pest resistance. Though presumed no local natural enemies, we discovered two naturally occurring parasitoids and a pathogenic fungus in AL in 2014 (Golec et al. 2013, Gardner et al. 2013). However, their economic impact in suppressing kudzu bug populations and effects on soybean yield remain unclear. Because it is new pest in U.S. and its pest status continue elevating in urban, agriculture and international trade, kudzu bug research deserves a high priority.',\n",
       " 'Much of the fresh produce that is consumed in the United States is imported from other countries. Because of the potential to introduce plant pathogens with imported plant products, government agencies such as USDA-APHIS are charged with protecting American agriculture by enforcing quarantine laws and by screening produce before it enters into the country. In most cases, the sheer volume of produce that must be screened implies that only material with clearly visible disease symptoms will be intercepted. Yet, virtually all land plants harbor endophytic fungi, some of which could be pathogenic species. Thus the potential exists to inadvertently introduce new pathogens with healthy-looking produce. This project uses a combination of molecular and morphological methods to examine the fungi that are entering the country cryptically within imported fruits and vegetables.',\n",
       " 'Smut fungi are a major group ofplant parasites that include pathogens of agriculturally important plants. Advances in molecular techniques provide a mechanism for addressing long-standing issues regarding species delimitation that impact effective control strategies and quarantine issues. It is vital for US agriculture that smut taxa be clearly distinguished and identified by the most current methods, and that their host ranges be adequately documented.The most recent comprehensivetreatment of smut fungi by European smut expert Kalman Vanky published in 2012recognized 1650 species in 93 genera, with 50% of the species infecting grasses (Poaceae) and 20% infecting sedges (Cyperaceae). Most of the smut fungiare poorly studied, and Vanky estimates thatthe number of known species may represent only a third of what actually exists. Smut fungi cause direct yield losses to cultivated crop and ornamental plants, and are responsible for indirect economic impacts due to quarantine restrictions on products contaminated with spores. Tilletia, Urocystis and Ustilago are three of the largest genera of smut fungi representing ~30% of described species,includingspecies infecting economically important hosts, and are the focus of this project.A high degree of host specialization is assumed for the majority of smut fungi and the majority (86% of described species) are recorded as infecting five or fewer hosts. However,1% of smuts considered to have broad host ranges--those species infecting 20 or more hosts.Identification and classificationof smut fungi has traditionally relied on a limited number of morphological characters, such as spore size, shape, ornamentation and color that issuperimposed on host range. Molecular techniquesprovidea more robust classification of smut fungi, but relatively few of the described species have been the subject of modern molecular studies.The objectives of the project are to enhance and preserve collections of smut fungi that infect wild and cultivated plants in North America, with an emphasis on smuts infecting grasses. Specimens will be characterized using molecular and morphological methods, and phylogenetic analyses will be conducted to determine species limits and for estimating diversity in aforementioned genera of smut fungi. The research is expected to provide a more robust method for identifying smut fungi that can be used by plant pathologists, quarantine and other regulatory officials for determining if smut fungi found on previously unreported hosts represent a new species, or a species that has made a jump to a new host. More robustcharacterization of smut fungi, and readily accessible identification resources including standardized molecular protocols is important to maintain theglobal movement of seed and grains.',\n",

Many of these are first-generation farmers from non-farm backgrounds, who need support to determine how land tenure decisions will impact the financial health of their farm businesses. Although there are a number of financial planning tools available, none are specifically focused on financial decision-making for land access.The overarching goal for this BFRDP Standard Project is to enable beginning farmers and ranchers across the country to make informed financial decisions during the process of accessing land so that they will have a solid framework on which to build strong, sustainable farm businesses.This project will allow farmers throughout the country to navigate land access options--including long-term leases, land trust partnerships, mission-driven farmland investor opportunities, and traditional farm loans. The project would create an interactive Land Affordability Calculator Tool (both online and print workbook versions), and include a series of 10 webinars and 8 in-person trainings. The project resources will reach thousands of beginning farmers through our extensive email, social media and partner networks.

       " 'Project Summary/Abstract:Genes in highly identical segmental duplications (SDs) play critical roles in human evolution and disease. SDsthemselves mediate pathogenic duplications, deletions, and other rearrangements whose effects range fromneurodevelopmental conditions like autism to syndromic congenital diseases. The genes contained withinSDs, once duplicated, are fertile ground for adaptive tinkering, and may provide innovations that underlie theevolution of human-specific traits.However, the duplicate nature of these genes has always presented extra challenges to their study. They arefound in regions of the genome that are some of the most difficult to sequence and assemble; they sufferfrom incomplete and inaccurate annotation due to the difficulty of correctly assigning and assemblingsequenced fragments of transcripts; and related to this, for many duplicated genes it is not known if they arefunctional—i.e., if they encode a translated and functioning protein.This project seeks to annotate segmentally duplicated genes at the level of transcription and translation andproposes a strategy to address these challenges. We will leverage a haploid genome to better discriminatebetween highly identical copies of genome sequence, we will combine single-molecule long-read sequencingtechnology with a custom cDNA enrichment strategy to accurately determine transcription of SD genes, andwe will take advantage of new developments in mass spectrometry technology to identify paralog-specificpeptides and determine which of these genes are translated.The goal of this study is identify functional, protein-coding genes among segmentally duplicated regions ofthe human genome. The generalizable approach developed in this study can be applied to duplicated spacein other genomes as well. These genes will serve as candidates for future studies of human evolution anddisease. If successful, this study will shed enormous light onto one of the oldest and most challengingproblems in the study of the human genome.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTInfluenza remains an important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The primary strategyto attenuate the impact of influenza epidemics is vaccination, but vaccine effectiveness is suboptimal.Additionally, in the event of a pandemic, vaccines may not be available. Alternative methods to prevent thespread of influenza are needed but little is known about the spread of infection in households and communitiesin our modern lifestyle. Current surveillance activities do not allow for the characterization of the transmissiondynamics of influenza in the community. Understanding the contemporary patterns and timing of influenzainfection within households and communities is the foundation for preventative interventions such as home-quarantine, prophylactic use of antivirals, social distancing, school-closures, and vaccination. It is believed thatup to 30% of influenza transmission occurs in households. Our understanding of influenza transmission inhouseholds and communities has been largely based on studies that were done several decades ago.Diagnostic tests have changed and current molecular and sequencing techniques provide new opportunities tostudy influenza transmission. Similarly, social interaction patterns within households and communities havelikely changed during the last decades, and the widespread availability and use of personal electronic devicesmay have further modified the dynamic of human contacts within households. Thus, transmission patterns mayhave changed. Prospective efficient household transmission studies are needed to understand the currentdynamics of influenza transmission within households and to identify complementary strategies for diseaseprevention and control. During three consecutive years, we will conduct a case-ascertained study to determinethe transmission of influenza in households, with the following specific aims: 1. To determine the risk ofsecondary influenza transmission in households over three consecutive influenza seasons; 2. To determine theeffectiveness of influenza vaccination (VE) against secondary influenza transmission in households over threeconsecutive influenza seasons.',\n",
       " 'PROJECT SUMMARYCraniofacial anomalies are among the most common and debilitating human birth defects, affecting 1/500 to1/2000 births depending on the population. Diagnosis and treatment of craniofacial anomalies is furthercomplicated by variation in the severity (phenotypic penetrance) of defects. It is widely recognized that similargenetic mutations often express a spectrum of disease phenotypes, but it is still unknown what mechanismscontribute to this variation. For example, human patients with mutations in Satb2 exhibit a range of craniofacialphenotypes, including small lower jaws (micrognathia) and variable penetrance in cleft palate. Similarly, inmice, Satb2 has a dosage-effect on jaw size. Notably, Satb2 heterozygotes exhibit the full range of jaw sizevariation between WT (normal) to mutant (severe micrognathia and cleft palate). That such variation in sizeoccurs on an inbred, genetically identical background, suggests that developmental (non-genomic) variation inmolecular determinants (e.g., mRNA, protein) contributes to variation in jaw size. Yet, it is unknown whatmechanisms cause such variation. Our central hypothesis is that cellular variation in proliferation andapoptosis of mesenchymal progenitors of the jaw results from differences in the levels and variance of Satb2molecular determinants. Subtle random variation in the production of molecular determinants may affect cellfate when RNA or protein concentrations are near a threshold level (as predicted for Satb2 heterozygotes).Such a threshold model would produce a non-linear relationship between genotype and phenotype, which haspreviously been predicted to explain high levels of morphological variation in disease models. Using both an invivo (Aim 1) and in vitro (Aim 2) approach, we will evaluate how levels and variance of Satb2 moleculardeterminants contribute to variation in the size of the jaw by regulating survival of jaw progenitors. Datagenerated from work in this proposal will provide essential knowledge about the role of development ingenerating phenotypic variation. This approach will significantly advance developmental biology by improvingmethods for relating tissue-level morphology to single-cell molecular biology. Importantly, this work will alsosubstantially enhance the research environment and provide exciting opportunities for undergraduates toconduct high-impact research, preparing them to enter the biomedical workforce.',\n",

       " \"The mission of this core laboratory is to provide support to the immunotherapy program established by the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute. The laboratory is managed by two co-investigators, Drs. John Wunderlich and Robert Somerville, and each investigator has submitted the same annual report. The main effort of the laboratory involves the production of large numbers of human anti-cancer T lymphocytes ex vivo, to treat patients with advanced metastatic cancer enrolled in Surgery Branch clinical trials. Cancer targeting lymphocytes are either isolated directly from biopsied material or are generated by genetically modifying T lymphocytes from a patient's blood. 32 cell products, delivered to patients enrolled on 14 trials, were used to treat patients with cell therapies generated by this core laboratory during FY17 through August 1st. 57 patients underwent resection to generate tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures for treatment, and successful cultures were established for sixty-four of these patients. A second critical function of this core lab is to collect, process, and curate samples from patients enrolled on Surgery Branch protocols. These samples are used to generate the cancer therapies described above and are also used by investigators in the Surgery Branch cell therapy program to evaluate the progress of each clinical trial, as well as to address research questions that identify changes that can be implemented to improve these trials. In addition, the samples from these trials facilitate research that generates new patient therapies. These research projects include 1) Transducing patients' T cells with genes whose products will better target tumors or enhance endogenous tumor activity, 2) Evaluating the ability of infused anticancer lymphocytes to function and survive in patients, 3) Identifying new cancer-associated antigens that can be targeted by anticancer cells, 4) Identifying novel patient specific antigens that are created by somatic mutations and selecting cultures that recognize these mutations for use in personalized T cell therapies 5) Identifying characteristics of infused anticancer cells that are associated with objective tumor regression, 6) Identifying characteristics of patients who are most likely to respond to anticancer T cell therapies, 7) Evaluating selected biological response modifiers tested in Surgery Branch clinical trials, 8) Evaluating new gene delivery systems such as the sleeping beauty transposon, 9) Producing dendritic cell vaccines that are pulsed with peptides representing a patient's own unique mutanome. Finally, the core laboratory maintains and curates all source documents, data, protocols, and expertise associated with cGMP manufacturing and the portion of the clinical translation of anticancer cell therapies carried out in the core lab. Due to the success of these therapies developed by the Surgery Branch, investigators within the Surgery Branch, intramural NCI laboratories, extramural regulatory agencies, industrial and academic partners, and other interested parties increasingly want access to these data, protocols, and advice. There is a need to develop new tools for curating data from older trials. There is a need to convert existing data into a format that can be read by newer software packages, it is essential that existing data generated in the core lab is not lost as older file types become obsolete. In response to two independent audits of the Surgery Branch cell production facility in early 2016, several programs and systems have been developed to comply with NIH, FDA and industry guidance/best practices. Under a memorandum of understanding with the department of transfusion medicine (DTM), we have established an independent Quality Assurance (QA) program. This QA program functions independently of the cell processing facility and has the authority to stop production or prevent the release of cell-based therapies manufactured by the Surgery Branch cell processing facility when deemed necessary. Additionally, the QA program performs internal audits to ensure compliance with SOPs and procedures and approves the new employee and annual training of the facility staff. These programs ensure that patient safety, along with generating clinically effective anti-cancer cells, is a primary concern of all employees involved in the manufacture of cell-based therapies. A crucial component of the QA program is document control. A new document control system, MediaLab, has been implemented to ensure that all staff has access to the most update version of SOPs, forms, and regulations used by the cell processing facility. MediaLab allows full tracking of all document versions and changes to ensure better compliance and training for all cell processing facility SOPs and regulations. A cleaning service that specializes in cleanroom sanitation has been contracted to clean the facility, and the effectiveness of this program is tracked with a newly implemented environmental monitoring program that tracks and trends air and surface quality/cleanliness within the manufacturing areas of the facility. This program identifies potential sources of microbial contamination before they can impact the overall manufacturing operation. The final component of efforts to develop a robust QA system is the development of a materials management program. Materials management controls the acquisition, quarantine, acceptance, and release of all manufacturing materials. The goal of this program is to increase patient safety by improving documentation of source, lot number and expiration date and quality control of all materials used to manufacture cell products within the Surgery Branch cell processing facility. This program is crucial in identifying patient's whose past or pending treatments are associated with a manufacturer recall. The materials management program allows all patients impacted by a recall to be identified and monitored for adverse events. Robert Somerville is currently the facility manager of the Cell Production Facility at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, where the main interest is to establish successful gene therapies and cell-based treatments for patients with advanced metastatic cancer.\",\n",
       " 'Project summary Craniofacial anomalies are common human birth defects that have dramatic impact on the quality of lifeof the affected individual. To date, the bulk of our understanding of these congenital anomalies has dependedon mouse models, which, though invaluable, have limitations in their use in understanding human diseases.Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a promising platform for the study of theconsequences of patient-specific mutations in disease-relevant cell types. Craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS)is an X-linked disease that causes dramatic craniofacial dysmorphogenesis in patients that are mosaic formutations in the EFNB1 gene. Our preliminary studies in mouse models, in combination with published work,indicate that ephrin-B1 acts to re-organize craniofacial tissues based on a cellular phenomenon known as cellsorting. Eph/ephrin-mediated cell sorting is common to multiple developmental systems, but the cellular andmolecular mechanisms at play are incompletely understood. We have established patient-specific hiPSCsfrom multiple individuals in a family affected by CFNS and have developed a developmentally relevant humancellular model system for understanding this congenital craniofacial disease. We will determine the basiccellular mechanisms by which cell sorting occurs and determine how Eph/Ephrin-mediated signaling isregulated in CFNS patient-derived cell types.',\n",
       " 'Because the clinical expression of filarial infections in expatriates is significantly different from that in those exposed from birth to the parasite, we have continued to define more precisely the differences between travelers (or long term residents) and those native to filarial-endemic regions. Thus, we have collated our long-term data to demonstrate quite definitively the differences in both risk of acquisition of these infections as well as the clinical manifestations of infection.  Our data suggest that eosinophil-mediated processes are responsible for many of the differences seen. We have done a similar retrospective study of a large number of patients with onchocerciasis that suggests that the skin dwelling O. volvulus drives responses in both temporary residents and those with lifelong exposure that are very different than what has been seen for the blood-borne filarial infections (Showler, Nutman submitted).         The role of O. volvulus-specific antigens in the pathogenesis of the Nodding Syndrome was demonstrated quite definitively.  The mechanism underlying this appears to be a set of O. volvulus-induced antibodies that cross reacts with leimodin-1, a human CNS-expressed protein.  These antibodies appear to be neurotoxic.     Having previously developed a high throughput, highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic panel for the 8 most common gastrointestinal parasites of humans, we  have expanded and improved this panel.  This newer methodology was used both in a large cohort study in Kenya and as part of collaboration with the CDC Division of Quarantine in which >2000 Burmese refugees were studied while in refugee camps in Thailand and following re-settlement in the United States.        Because of the severe post treatment reactions seen in loiasis, new methods of safer treatment have been sought. Unlike many of the other filarial infections Loa loa does not contain the intracellular Wolbachia endosymbiont.  This and other data have suggested that it is the eosinophil activation and tissue eosinophilia that is mediating the severe post treatment inflammatory reactions.       To understand better the pathogenesis of filarial infections (onchocerciasis, loiaisis, lymphatic filarasis) clinical assessments of patients with these and other related non-filarial (strongyloides, malaria) infections have been studied in detail. The influence that filarial infections have on the clinical expression of non-filarial infectious diseases have also been studied by performing clinical trials in filarial-endemic regions of the world that are co-endemic for malaria (Mali), tuberculosis (India) and HIV (India).       New diagnostic approaches have been developed and utilized for the rapid and specific diagnosis of Strongyloidiasis, loiasis, and onchocerciasis.  Rapid (almost point of care) diagnostics have been developed for surveillance of W. bancrofti and O. volvulus following mass drug distribution campaigns.',\n",
       " 'Project SummaryRecent research in evolutionary biology has begun to untangle the historical paths and mechanisms underlyinghow new molecular functions evolve. However, considerably less is known about why a particular path is takenby evolution or why a specific biochemical mechanism is used to evolve the new function in the first place. Wasthis the only path and mechanism available to evolution? Or did alternative paths and mechanisms exist, butwere simply more difficult for evolution to find? Is selection capable of driving evolution towards a particularoutcome or along a particular path, or is the result of evolution fundamentally dependent on chance events?What are the forces that determine the number of alternative paths and mechanisms available to evolution?Could other functions have evolved instead? To answer these questions, we need to know not only what hasoccurred during evolution, but also what else was possible. This project will address these questions usingsteroid receptor proteins as a model system. These proteins play important roles in human physiology anddevelopment and underlie risk of several human cancer types. As a consequence, the paths and mechanismstowards altered molecular function of steroid receptor proteins are of general medical relevance. To identifyalternative outcomes and paths towards new molecular functions, a recently developed system for locus specificexperimental evolution will be used to evolve an ancestral steroid receptor protein towards its modern functionwithin the laboratory. By using an ancestral protein, this project will ‘replay the tape of life’ and explore multiplealternative evolutionary outcomes of an important transition in DNA binding specificity that underlies modernsteroid receptors ability to activate distinct sets of genes in response to distinct steroid cues. In addition todetermining how else the historical change in DNA specificity could have arisen, this project will evolve the sameancestral protein towards changes in DNA specificity that did not, but could have, occurred in nature to identifyalternative paths that evolution may have taken given another opportunity. Using these evolved paths, thebiochemical mechanisms underlying the changes in specificity will be determined and compared to themechanism historically used by evolution. Finally, the sites of substitution, the types of substitution, and themechanisms underlying change in DNA specificity will be compared among and between alternative paths andalternative changes in specificity to identify the determinants of why evolution found the particular outcome, tookthe particular path, and used the particular mechanism that it did. Answers to these questions will create a deeperunderstanding of how the evolutionary process works and help determine the extent to which changes inmolecular function are restricted by the shape of sequence space and the evolutionary process.',\n",
       " 'Cyanobacterial algal blooms plague lakes and rivers across the globe.  These toxic blooms damage the health of lake ecosystems, threaten the public health of surrounding communities, and harm local economies due a reduction in tourism and fishing industries. Blooms are hard to combat, mainly because the factors that contribute to the successful growth of bloom-forming microbes are not yet fully understood. This project will provide new insight into how algal blooms occur by focusing on how the algae interact with surrounding bacteria to obtain and exchange the nutrients, especially nitrogen, that allow the blooms to occur. Through a combination of experimental manipulation, measurements, and physiological modeling, the work will provide a detailed picture of how nitrogen exchange promotes algal blooms.  This results will help environmental managers develop effective mitigation strategies to combat toxic blooms in lakes and rivers. Experiments will be conducted by undergraduate students at James Madison and Wright State Universities, and much of the research will take place in an undergraduate classroom setting, providing excellent training for students early in their science careers. The researchers will also work with homeschooled students in rural areas, inspiring potential young scientists.In aquatic systems, interactions between primary producers and heterotrophic bacteria alter water chemistry and shape ecosystem function. The goal of this project is to quantify and model interactions, specifically nitrogen exchange, between heterotrophic bacteria and a model primary producer in the phycosphere (the microenvironment surrounding a phytoplankton cell).  This work will:  1) quantify the reliance of the model freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis on the heterotrophic bacteria in the phycosphere; 2) quantify and model the transfer of nitrogen between Microcystis and specific phycosphere partners, using co-culture experiments with a single heterotrophic partner, and profile the transcriptome while simultaneously performing targeted nitrogen-related metabolite analysis; and 3) expand the model of nitrogen transfer to the entire phycosphere consortium by tracing and quantifying the flow of different nitrogen compounds through the symbiotic phycosphere consortium.',\n",
       " 'This research will apply knowledge about coordination mechanisms that was gained in biology to better understand and to improve coordination in peer production using information and communication technologies. Peer production has emerged as an important economic force. It produces knowledge infrastructure that underlies many aspects of educational and research institutions. Thus, ways of furthering peer production may have broad impacts on the infrastructure that supports invention, and in turn on the economy. More generally, collaborative editing is used in most industries that manage knowledge, and so progress on this front may have impacts in corporations, partnerships, non-profits, and government institutions. The research will not only seek an increased understanding of peer production but also will build tools and interfaces that seek to improve the collective creativity of online communities. Models, data sets, and accompanying simulations will be built for two purposes: as explicit forms of knowledge for reuse by other researchers, and as materials for education. The investigation will proceed through a set of observational studies and experiments, to explore how coordination mechanisms that have been discovered through studies in the field of biology may provide useful insights into human behavior. Recent studies have indicated that coordination in open source and peer production networks can be explained at least in part by stigmergy, a process discovered by biologists in which the traces of work become conditions or signals that generate more work.  Peer production is described as being stigmergic because coordination often happens not through explicit planning conversations, but through interactions triggered by previous interactions, all centered on the primary technical artifact, some form of text or source code.  The work will proceed in three phases: (1) performing studies that examine how interaction rates affect productivity in peer production networks such as Wikipedia; (2) applying dynamic models from mathematical biology to peer production, first through an observational study and then through an experiment, and (3) testing alternative interfaces for peer production and applying the findings to other collaborative editing environments.',\n",
       " 'The cycling of nitrogen in arid lands, deserts, and areas with limited water and frequent high temperatures is challenging to study and does not fit within the current understanding of other areas such as forests or grasslands. In arid lands,?nitrogen concentrations are generally low and many biological processes are limited by nitrogen availability during wet periods. ?However, many arid land ecosystems also exhibit high rates of nitrogen loss more characteristic of areas with a nitrogen abundance. ?During wet periods soils may emit high nitrogen concentrations. Because of these nitrogen pulses, arid lands may have an important role in atmospheric chemistry although the magnitudes or fate of emissions are not well known. ?Return of the soil nitrogen pulses to the soil may be a previously unaccounted nutrient source contributing to downwind nitrogen deposition. ?New research directed to characterizing arid land nitrogen dynamics across landscapes may resolve these apparent contradictions, contribute to more comprehensive understanding, and improve understanding of the broad-scale effects of nitrogen enrichment.?The findings will be communicated to the federal and state agencies that are directly affected by atmospheric nitrogen including Joshua Tree National Park. ?Training opportunities, targeted for underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students, include tools for trace gases, isotopes, genomes, and modeling. ?The results will be communicated to the local community through UC Cooperative Extension and an annual public lecture series that targets K-12 educators throughout the region. ?This project will develop and test a hypothesis of pulse-induced nutrient spiraling to explain the landscape distribution of nitrogen concentrations and sources in southern California. ?The central hypothesis borrows from nutrient dynamics in stream systems where movement downstream leads to biogeochemical ?spirals?, as nutrients cycle from dissolved and biotic forms. ?In arid lands, it is hypothesized that soil pulses of gaseous nitrogen emissions coupled with atmospheric transport and deposition forms such a spiral and propagates nitrogen enrichment across a landscape. ??This hypothesis will be evaluated across a transect of decreasing nitrogen deposition extending from Riverside, CA to the eastern edge of Joshua Tree National Park where replicated experiments will be conducted that assess soil nitrogen pulses and identifies their sources through isotopic and genomic tools. These experiments will test predictions that pulses of soil nitrogen emissions have characteristic isotopic signatures and increasingly dominate soil nitrogen content downwind from urban sources. ?The experimental results will be used to inform a regional atmospheric transport and chemistry model that will simulate nitrogen dynamics throughout southern California. ?The model simulations will further test predictions that soil pulse emissions can influence atmospheric nitrogen chemistry and subsequent nitrogen deposition.',\n",
       " 'This is a focused program of field research in waters of the Western Tropical North Atlantic influenced by the Amazon River Plume during the high river flow season. The Amazon Plume region supports diverse plankton communities in a dynamic system driven by nutrients supplied by transport from the river proper as well as nutrients entrained from offshore waters by physical mixing and upwelling. This creates strong interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The field program will link direct measurements of environmental properties with focused experimental studies of nutrient supply and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton, as well as the transfer of phytoplankton nitrogen to the zooplankton food web. The Amazon Plume exhibits a close juxtaposition of distinct communities during the high-flow season, making it an ideal site for evaluating how nutrient availability, nutrient supply, and habitat longevity interact to drive offshore ecosystem dynamics and function. This project will include German collaborators and will seamlessly integrate education and research efforts. The investigators and their institutions have a strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate education and to increasing the diversity of the ocean science community through active recruiting and training efforts. The team has a strong track record of involving both undergraduate and graduate students in their field and lab research.  The two research cruises planned will provide opportunities for students and technicians to interact with an interdisciplinary and international research team.    The ultimate objectives of this project are to understand the processes and interactions that promote distinct communities of nitrogen-fixing organisms (diazotrophs) and other phytoplankton around the Amazon Plume and to explore the impacts of these diazotroph-rich communities on zooplankton biomass and production. The research team includes scientists with expertise in nutrient and stable isotope biogeochemistry, remote sensing as well as specialists in characterizing water mass origin and history using naturally occurring radium isotopes. This combination of approaches will provide a unique opportunity to address fundamental questions related to plankton community structure, primary production, and links to secondary production in pelagic ecosystems. The project will address the following key questions focused on fundamental issues in plankton ecology resulting from previous research in this region:A. What mechanisms promote the preferential delivery of bioavailable phosphorus and the resulting strong nitrogen limitation associated with the northern reaches of the Amazon Plume during the high flow season? B. What factors lead to the clear niche separation between diazotrophs within and around the Amazon Plume and how are the distinct diazotroph communities influenced by hydrographic and biogeochemical controls associated with the Amazon River Plume and offshore upwelling processes? C. How does the nitrogen fixed by the different types of diazotrophs contribute to secondary production, and how efficiently does diazotroph nitrogen move through the food web?',\n",
       " 'This research project will improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms and the spatio-temporal dynamics of laser filamentation in solids.  Laser filamentation is self-guidance of a high-power laser pulse propagating through a gas, liquid or solid material when self-focusing of the pulse is balanced by defocusing due to the laser-induced modifications in the material.  This remarkable phenomenon finds a lot of applications such as table-top ultraviolet and x-ray generation, lightning guiding, rainmaking, selective radiotherapy on cancer cells, long-lived waveguides in air, and remote sensing of pollutants.  This project will also promote basic science education to groups, such as grandparent-led rural families, who have been traditionally underrepresented in science.Laser filamentation is self-guidance of a high-power laser pulse when self-focusing due to the optical Kerr effect is balanced by defocusing due to material ionization and/or other nonlinear mechanisms.  Although laser filamentation has been studied mainly using near-infrared and visible wavelengths, recent progress in ultrafast laser technology enables the investigation of laser filamentation using longer wavelengths such as mid-infrared and long-wavelength infrared.  In this project, laser filamentation in solids will be experimentally studied by measuring plasma densities directly inside the filaments, with the experiments guided by 3-dimensional computer simulations of laser matter interactions.  The project will impact filament-based technology such as new ultrabroadband and ultrashort light generation for spectroscopy and optical communications.',\n",
       " \"Part 1:   The project addresses fundamental questions regarding the role of nitrification (the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by a two-step process involving two different guilds of microorganisms:  ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers)in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.  Specifically, the project seeks to evaluate the contribution of primary production supported by the energy in nitrogen compounds to the overall supply of organic carbon to the food web of the Southern Ocean.  Previous measurements indicate that nitrification could contribute about 9% to primary production supporting the Antarctic food web on an annual basis, but those measurements did not include the additional production associated with nitrite oxidation.  Additionally, the project will aim to determine the significance of the contribution of other sources of nitrogen, (specifically organic nitrogen and urea released by other organisms) to nitrification because these contributions may not be assessed by standard protocols. Such work will aid in better understanding the basis of the energy for the Antarctic marine ecosystems on an annual basis as well as better aid in understanding the energetics of the ecosystem in times and places where primary production based on light energy is limited (i.e. during the polar night or under sea ice cover). This project will result in training a postdoctoral researcher and provide undergraduate students opportunities to gain hand-on experience with research on microbial geochemistry. The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) activities have focused largely on the interaction between ocean climate and the marine food web affecting top predators. Relatively little effort has been devoted to studying processes related to the microbial geochemistry of nitrogen cycling, yet these are a major themes at other LTER sites. This work will contribute substantially to understanding an important aspect of nitrogen cycling and bacterioplankton production in the study area. The team will be working synergistically and be participating fully in the education and outreach efforts of the Palmer LTER, including making highlights of the findings available for posting to their project web site and participating in any special efforts they have in the area of outreach.Part 2:  The proposed work will quantify oxidation rates of 15N supplied as ammonium, urea and nitrite, allowing the estimation of the contribution of urea-derived N and complete nitrification (ammonia to nitrate) to chemoautotrophy and bacterioplankton production in Antarctic coastal waters.  The project will compare these estimates to direct measurements of the incorporation of 14C into organic matter in the dark for an independent estimate of chemoautotrophy.  The team aims to collect samples spanning the water column: from surface water (~10 m), winter water (50-100 m) and circumpolar deep water (>150 m); on a cruise surveying the continental shelf and slope west of the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral summer of 2018. Other samples will be taken to measure the concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and urea, for qPCR analysis of the abundance of relevant microorganisms, and for studies of related processes. The project will rely on collaboration with the existing Palmer LTER to ensure that ancillary data (bacterioplankton abundance and production, chlorophyll, physical and chemical variables) will be available. The synergistic activities of this project along with the LTER activities will provide a unique opportunity to assess chemoautotrophy in context of the overall ecosystem's dynamics- including both primary and secondary production processes.\",\n",
       " 'Spatial nonuniformity of the environment is important in the survival or extinction of many large-scale ecological and epidemiological systems. This project studies how movement of organisms in the environment affects ecosystem survival or epidemic outbreak/extinction. Examples of such movement include dispersal of marine larvae between different reefs under water flow, spreading of infectious diseases via holiday travel or environmental pathogen movement, and infection through movement of insects that carry disease. Several user-friendly quantitative indices and their computation will be introduced to biologists and other scientists as tools for detecting and preventing ecological extinction or epidemic outbreaks. The research will model and optimize the effect of vaccination, medical treatment, and quarantine in epidemic events, and harvesting and harvesting restrictions for agricultural/fishery/forestry systems, to provide answers to important questions about sustaining high quality living environments and preventing epidemic outbreaks. Sample applications of the proposed research include (a) preventing cholera epidemics spreading through a common water source and (b) restoring Chesapeake Bay oyster populations. The outcomes from application projects will provide actionable strategies for government agencies, and the results will improve economic productivity of fisheries. The impact of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal on key ecological indices and properties will be quantitatively defined and calculated, and a unified mathematical framework will be developed to study the persistence, stability and control of both single and interacting species in heterogeneous environment or networks. The focus is the impact of asymmetric movement on the dynamical behavior of the biological systems, and infusing graph theory, matrix theory and their continuous counterparts into the study of corresponding dynamical systems is a key to the new theory. Several classical concepts in dynamical systems and mathematical biology such as Lyapunov stability theory, basic reproduction number, maximum sustainable yield and a new concept of target reproduction number will be defined in a broader context and analyzed with the additional network structure and spatial heterogeneity. The project will train graduate students and undergraduate students, and the modeling skills and new mathematical techniques that students acquire from the project will make them part of a future workforce with strong quantitative and analytical ability.',\n",
       " \"As human populations increase, so will the demand for food. Nitrogen fertilizer production helps meet this need.  However, adding excess nitrogen drastically alters natural habitats such as salt marshes and others that receive water as runoff from land. Coastal wetlands provide several ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish and birds, storm surge protection, and nutrient filtration. Prior studies suggest that excess nitrogen may increase decomposition in these sediments, resulting in faster degradation of complex organic matter to carbon dioxide. What controls these processes, and the micro-organisms responsible for them is not well understood. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of added nitrogen on organic matter decomposition. This research will provide an in-depth analysis of the members of the salt marsh microbiome and their activities in marsh sediments. Data will provide insight into how  salt marshes are responding to nitrogen fertilizer runoff, information that is essential for the adaptive management of coastal wetland systems and their response to environmental change. This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use controlled flow through reactor systems to investigate the mechanistic effect of nitrate on microbial decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter. We hypothesize that, because nitrate is a favorable electron acceptor in heterotrophic, microbial respiration, it can promote oxidation of organic matter that would otherwise remain unprocessed. Current biogeochemical data indicate a significant increase in microbial respiration, particularly denitrification, in response to nitrate addition, with the most pronounced effect in deep sediments ranging from 150 to 200 years old. This is significant, because organic matter at this depth is typically thought to be more resistant to microbial degradation, which means that the capacity of salt marshes to store carbon may lessen with eutrophication. To further assess these results, we need to gain a better understanding of the microbial consortia responsible for organic matter decomposition. Microbial activity plays a critical role in controlling how much carbon is decomposed; though we know little about salt marsh sediment microbiome structure and function, and how it may change in response to nitrate addition. Accordingly, this dissertation improvement grant will contribute to existing data by taking an integrated 'meta-omics' approach. To complement flow through reactor experiments, the microbial genetic underpinnings of organic matter decomposition under conditions of nutrient enrichment will be investigated using metagenomics, and the metabolic activity of these microbial players will be assessed by measuring the expression of the microbial metatranscriptome. These data have the potential to reveal novel microbial lineages from deep salt marsh sediment, and draw unique linkages between microbial gene expression patterns and changes in organic carbon quality. Successful integration of these meta-omics approaches with existing geochemical rate measurements will vastly improve our understanding of the role of microbes in organic matter decomposition, and potentially allow for a better predictive understanding for how carbon storage capacity in salt marshes will respond to future nitrogen loading.\",\n",
       " \"Cancer's ability to evolve in response to the pressures exerted by therapy is the single most common causeof therapeutic failure and poor clinical outcomes, across all cancer types. Despite the definitive link ofcancer evolution to poor patient outcomes, we still lack a systemic framework to rationally designtherapeutic strategies to anticipate and counter this evolution.We studied the evolution of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which epitomizes the challenge posedto modern oncology by cancer evolution: despite effective therapies, the disease invariably recurs. Wehave developed novel methods to measure the critical dimension of intra-tumoral diversity, using genomicand epigenomic data (Cell, 2013; Cancer Cell, 2014; Nature, 2015, Nature Communications, 2016,Nature Communications, in press). Notably, we have shown that evolution with therapy is virtuallyuniversal, and is anticipated by pretreatment intra-tumoral diversity.To overcome this diversity, effective combination therapy is needed. However, combination therapydesign is based on limited data (overlapping toxicities, qualitative pre-clinical data), and fails to engagewith the large combinatorial space of drugs, dosages, and schedules. In addition, we lack the tools torobustly identify epigenetic modifications that contribute to cancer evolution with therapy ( epidrivers ), orstudy evolution in relation to its micro-environment.We aim to transform cancer therapy by building the knowledge infrastructure required for combinationtherapy to directly anticipate and address evolution. To do so, we will measure clonal growth rates directlyfrom serial patient samples collected under the umbrella of phase I/II clinical trials. We will utilize thesedata to prioritize and optimize combination therapy in a data-driven, iterative, personalized fashion.Furthermore, our studies show that genetic clonal complexity does not fully account for the evolutionaryplasticity of CLL. We will apply cutting-edge statistical inference to longitudinally sampled CLLs, profiled withbulk and single-cell bisulfite sequencing. Through these studies, we will identify candidate epigenetic andmicro-environmental determinants of evolution in response to therapy.Collectively, this novel set of tools will replace current empiric therapy trial design, which is based onqualitative data and takes years to yield insights. Instead, our foundational work will support data-drivencombinatorial therapy. The genetic, epigenetic, and environmental evolutionary potential of CLL will bemapped and personalized combinations will be nominated. Precision, real-time measurements of clonalkinetics will enable us to continuously optimize the drug combinations, dosages, and schedules in order tomaximize overall efficacy and overcome the central obstacle of tumor evolution.\",\n",

This E/I imbalance in DS is largely resulted from overproduction of GABAergic interneurons. Tostudy the mechanisms of intellectual disability of DS, we must better understand how interneuron productionfrom neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is regulated during development. OLIG genes, including OLIG1 and OLIG2,are mapped to HSA21 and triplicated in DS. Studies in mouse models demonstrate that during embryonicdevelopment, both Olig1 and 2 are abundantly expressed in the ganglionic eminence, a brain structure locatedin the ventral embryonic telencephalon and from where most cortical interneurons are born. Moreover, Oliggenes critically regulate interneuron production. Notably, expression of OLIG genes is starkly different in thehuman versus rodent developing ganglionic eminence. We found that differentiation of human inducedpluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) to ventral forebrain NPCs recapitulated the previous findings in human braintissue that OLIG2 was expressed in a subpopulation of human NPCs in the ganglionic eminence. In contrast,OLIG1 was expressed in very few of these NPCs and had a complimentary expression pattern with OLIG2. Upto now, the functions of human OLIG genes in the development of human GABAergic neuron is largelyunknown. Using DS patient-derived hiPSCs, we further identified that OLIG2 was overexpressed in the DShiPSC-derived ventral forebrain NPCs. Therefore, we hypothesize that abnormal expression of OLIG genes,particularly OLIG2, in human DS ventral forebrain NPCs determines the overproduction of GABAergic neuronsfrom these progenitors, which leads to E/I imbalance and significantly contributes to intellectual disability of DS.To test the hypothesis, I proposed three specific aims. Aim 1: to determine the role of OLIG2 in regulatinghuman GABAergic neuron production from normal hiPSCs. We will employ OLIG2 knockout hiPSCs generatedby using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to study the role of OLIG2 in human interneuron development. Aim 2: todetermine whether OLIG2 is a causal gene of the overproduction of GABAergic neurons in DS. By usingcontrol and DS hiPSCs, as well as the DS hiPSCs with normalized OLIG2 gene dosage, we will determinewhether overexpression of OLIG2 causes the overproduction of GABAergic neurons in DS. Aim 3: by using anovel humanized neuronal chimeric mouse model, we will further examine interneuron specification of thenormal and DS hiPSC-derived ventral forebrain NPCs and their integration and contribution to E/I imbalance invivo within intact neural circuits. Findings from this proposed study will provide novel insights into the functionof OLIG2 in regulating human GABAergic neuron production and shed new light on developing potentialtherapeutic applications for DS by regulating the expression of OLIG2 gene.',\n",
       " 'Summary AbstractPredicting the efficacy of an antibiotic in a patient is a critical component of successfully treating infection.Currently, there is an over-reliance on susceptibility assays involving pure bacterial cultures and controlledgrowth conditions. These conditions are drastically different to those experienced by the bacteria duringinfection. Hence, these assays fail to account for extrinsic factors that influence antibiotic susceptibility in theinfection environment. This contributes to unacceptable rates of treatment failure. Staphylococcus aureus isresponsible for numerous difficult-to-treat infections and antibiotic treatment failure is common. Theidentification of novel extrinsic factors that significantly influence S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility in vivo willgreatly improve our ability to predict antibiotic efficacy in patients, leading to improved treatment outcomes.These factors may include host interactions, nutrient and oxygen availability and interactions with othermicroorganisms during polymicrobial infection. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that P. aeruginosa produced molecules dramatically alter S.aureus antibiotic susceptibility. We find the production of these molecules is highly variable among P.aeruginosa clinical isolates. Preliminary experiments in mice suggest these interactions play an important rolein determining antibiotic efficacy in vivo. We hypothesize that P. aeruginosa strongly influences S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility in patientsduring polymicrobial infection.In Aim 1, we propose to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this altered antibiotic efficacy.Elucidation of these mechanisms will improve our understanding of S. aureus antibiotic tolerance and may alsolead to the development of novel adjuvants for the eradication of S. aureus populations. In Aim 2, to determine the importance of P. aeruginosa/S. aureus interactions in patients, we willexamine clinical isolate pairs from burn and cystic fibrosis patients. In Aim 3, to determine the relevance of these interactions during infection, we will examine antibioticefficacy against S. aureus mono-infection and during co-infection with P. aeruginosa using two complimentarymouse models of infection. Together, these experiments promise to reveal the role of bacterial interaction in determining theoutcome of antibiotic treatment of S. aureus. This will facilitate the future development of more sophisticated,more accurate susceptibility determination and improved treatment outcomes in patients.',\n",
       " \"Remote-controlled robots have the potential to allow humans to perform useful tasks without putting themselves in danger, or without travelling long distances. This project explores how humans can control nursing robots that can communicate with patients, collect vital signs, and perform routine cleaning tasks in quarantine environments. The use of these robots has the potential to protect nurses from infection during disease outbreaks, and to protect patients with weakened immune system. A significant challenge in this effort is to make the user interface to the robot easy enough for nurses to use without significant training. Because engineers are not experts in nursing, the research will let nurses customize the user interface by teaching the robot about objects, places, and tasks that are typically used in nursing. After training, artificial intelligence algorithms will then automatically estimate which actions the nurse wants to perform, and these will be presented in a simple user interface that allows the nurse to select those actions quickly. This project will continue an interdisciplinary collaboration between Duke's School of Engineering and School of Nursing. Research will be conducted in three thrust areas: 1) smart human operator interfaces for supervised autonomy that learn mappings between multimodal sensor input streams to provide simple, interpretable task options and status feedback; 2) hierarchical task learning algorithms for helping human experts train novel composite tasks; and 3) real world evaluation of human-robot system speed, reliability, operator workload, and operator learning curve using registered nurses and nursing students performing simulated clinical tasks in training environments.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Bioreactors can remove contaminants from wastewater while providing valuable products such as biofuels. Bioreactor function relies on an appropriate bacterial community structure for efficient conversion of waste. However, the bacterial community can be affected by bacteria present in the incoming waste stream. A less known way that the bioreactor bacterial community can be affected is by the presence of bacteriophage, viruses that only infect bacteria. Although phages are known to affect bacterial populations in marine environments, very little is known about bacteria-phage interactions in engineered bioreactors. The proposed research will evaluate the role of bacteriophage life-cycle on bioreactor bacterial communities based on the basic science of bacteria-phage interactions. This research will also shed light on whether phages participate in gene transfer with the bacterial communities. Results from this research will help define mechanisms for the removal of nitrogen, carbon, and pollutants from waste streams to protect ecological and human health, while producing valuable products like biofuels to enhance the Nation's energy security.The overarching goal of this project is to study the genomic content of viruses infecting key bacteria from activated sludge processes (ASP) and anaerobic digester microbial communities in lab-scale reactors and anaerobic digesters. Three broad questions have been proposed: (1) What is the genomic content and diversity of viral communities infecting key ASP bacteria and microbiomes in organic waste valorization anaerobic bioprocesses?; (2) How does phage genomic content change with process configuration, and what is the role of phages during process upsets?; and (3) Are the bacteriophages present in ASP bioreactors and anaerobic digesters contributing to gene transfers between different prokaryotes? Three sets of lab scale reactors will be used to simulate commonly used treatment scenarios in the wastewater community. These reactors will be subjected to various external perturbations and disturbances to study bacteriophages dynamics in these reactors. High throughput sequencing of bacterial and phage DNA, followed by a genome extraction exercise, will allow the study of bacterial-phage interactions in engineered bioreactors. Overall, this project will answer several fundamental questions related to phages in engineered bioreactors and add to the science of wastewater treatment. The fundamental knowledge gained in this research will be applicable in other natural and engineered systems This research project will contribute to graduate and undergraduate education, and U.S graduate students will learn new techniques related to ecosystem research and virology.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\",\n",
       " \"Developing efficient and cost-effective intervention and monitoring strategies for preventing the spread of infection in the plant and human world requires an understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which infection spreads spatially and temporally, and of the quantitative effect of different intervention strategies. In the case of plant pathogens, long-distance dispersal phenomena and spatial heterogeneity of infection spreading can lead to failure of disease-control strategies that are based on naive models. Furthermore, such weak control strategies are often uneconomical and use copious amounts of pesticides on crops. In the case of human-contagious diseases, better intervention strategies can be developed if quantitative effects of quarantine are known. By analyzing spatial epidemic models with long-distance dispersal and certain intervention strategies, this research project aims to provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of dispersal on features of plant epidemics, and into the effects of quarantine strategies on restraining the spread of contagious infection among humans. To guarantee that the results are relevant to epidemiology, a part of the project will be carried out in collaboration with ecologists and epidemiologists. The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology. This project addresses challenges in developing more effective and economical intervention strategies for preventing the spread of infection in the plant and human world. Most of the epidemic models that have been analyzed rigorously to investigate the role of space in infection spreading are nearest-neighbor in nature. However, there are many plant diseases where the infection spreads via long-distance dispersals. To understand the effect of long-distance dispersal on infection spreading, several complex agent-based models have been analyzed using simulation and some heuristic methods in the theoretical biology literature. These non-rigorous treatments of the epidemic models sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions. One of the primary goals of this project is to understand rigorously the effect of long-range interactions on the spread of infections and associated features. In this project, the investigator plans to study several aspects of long-range first-passage percolation models by adding  long-range interaction  features to the standard (nearest-neighbor) first-passage percolation models. The investigator also plans to study intervention strategies for SIS models, which are frequently used for modeling spread of recurring disease among humans, in one dimension and on complex heterogeneous graphs. The rigorous analyses of these models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques. These techniques are expected to lead to a deeper understanding of a broad class of spatial stochastic epidemic models.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"]"
