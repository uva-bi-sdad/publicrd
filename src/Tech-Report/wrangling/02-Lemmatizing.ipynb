       "\"The aggregation/fibrillation of alpha-synuclein is a critical factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). Alpha-Synuclein is a significant component of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies that are the pathological hallmark of PD and mutations and gene triplication of alpha-synuclein have been associated with rare cases of familial PD. Our overall goals are to design molecules that will inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation, and disaggregate existing alpha-synuclein fibrils. There is a critical need for an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease, since current therapies are only partially effective in treating the symptoms. Our preliminary data indicate that some catechols, flavonoids and related compounds have the potential to inhibit fibrillation of alpha-synuclein and disaggregate existing fibrils.  The aims of this proposal are:  1) To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of the inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibrillation by catechols, flavonoids and related compounds. Our preliminary investigations suggest that it is an oxidized form of the catechol that is most effective in inhibiting fibrillation. 2) To identify the active species, and the mechanism of disaggregation of alpha-synuclein fibrils by catechol-type compounds. 3) To determine whether catechols and related compounds prevent alpha-synuclein fibrillation and disaggregate fibrils in vivo. We will also perform a systematic investigation of the most promising compounds (as inhibitors and  disaggregators ) to identify key structural features in order to identify additional molecules that might be more suited for potential therapeutic uses.  The results of the proposed research should provide leads for inhibitors of alpha-synuclein aggregation and lay the groundwork for potential therapeutic approaches. In the long-run this research could provide new strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease\""

      "This award, co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering, aims at the synthesis and characterization of novel self-assembling nanostructured thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) biomaterials based on polyisobutylene (PIB).  Specifically, efforts to synthesize new  Entropy-driven  TPEs (ENTPE) will continue. Under the current NSF support it was discovered that the dendritic (arborescent or tree-like) arbPIB midblock of ENTPEs facilitates phase separation and TPE behavior even with very short plastic and elastomeric end blocks.  These novel ENTPE materials were further reinforced with nano-size fillers (carbon and silica) to yield strong rubbery nanocomposites (ENTPEC), and their biocompatibility was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in rabbits. Based on this discovery, new ENTPEs will be synthesized with short end blocks, capable of hydrogen bonding (e.g., polypeptides). Compounding these materials with nanofillers will yield new ENTPEC nanocomposites. In order to control surface chemistry and patterning for improved tissue integration, a new  modular  approach using ElectroNanoSprayingTM is proposed, which allows the construction of gradient surfaces with various chemistries and topologies. Spraying ENTPE onto the surface of ENTPEC will yield well-controlled nanopatterns of the same chemistry.  Surface chemistry will be controlled by spraying low molecular weight (MW) functionalized PIBs (PIB-F)  where F is a biologically active compound (nucleic acid base, peptide, protein, etc.) onto the surface of ENTPECs. The PIB-Fs will be precision synthesized from PIB-OH made by living carbocationic polymerization and functionalized using a novel enzyme-catalyzed transesterification process that yields complete conversion under mild conditions  this also emerged from the current grant. The  modular  approach will give unprecedented control over surface chemistry and surface patterning independently, and will contribute to new fundamental understanding of the effects of surface properties on the biocompatibility of polymeric materials.  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This project is aimed at the synthesis and characterization of novel biomaterials based on polyisobutylene (PIB). These materials are soft and transparent like silicone rubber, but self-assemble into a network without any chemical treatment which is necessary to make silicone rubber. In 2004, one PIB-based material was FDA-approved as the coating on drug-eluting coronary stents. More than a million of those stents have been implanted into patients, saving lives. The proposed new materials will have improved combination of properties. In addition, a new approach to surface modification to improve biocompatibility will be tested in this project. For this goal new polymers will be synthesized via  green polymer chemistry  using enzymes as catalysts, and sprayed to the surface of the novel biomaterials. This new  modular  approach will give independent control over surface chemistry and patterning, providing unprecedented insight into the effect of these properties on biocompatibility. The new materials may replace silicone rubber in certain applications (for example, as the shell of breast implants where impermeability is required). This project is interdisciplinary, building on collaborators (Nanocopoeia Inc. Minnesota, BioMedical Research Associates Akron, the University of Washington, Pomeranian Medical Academy of Poland, University of Bordeaux, France). It is complementary to a recently approved grant by German Research Foundation (DFG) as well as the grant approved by the Polish Ministry of Science and Education, to test various properties of the new biomaterials. The grant will support 1 partial female Post-doctoral fellow (Nanocopoeia's NSF grant will complement this to full time), four Ph. D. students (3 Americans - two of them females, one Hispanic), future REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) students, an RET (Research Experience for Teachers), and high school students. It will also support international student exchanges and project meetings directly, and international students indirectly. The project will expose students to a great variety of scientific disciplines (polymer chemistry, organic chemistry, material science, biochemistry, surface science, polymer engineering, biomedical engineering, proteomics etc.).

      "This award, co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of International Science and Engineering, aims at the synthesis and characterization of novel self-assembling nanostructured thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) biomaterials based on polyisobutylene (PIB).  Specifically, efforts to synthesize new  Entropy-driven  TPEs (ENTPE) will continue. Under the current NSF support it was discovered that the dendritic (arborescent or tree-like) arbPIB midblock of ENTPEs facilitates phase separation and TPE behavior even with very short plastic and elastomeric end blocks.  These novel ENTPE materials were further reinforced with nano-size fillers (carbon and silica) to yield strong rubbery nanocomposites (ENTPEC), and their biocompatibility was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in rabbits. Based on this discovery, new ENTPEs will be synthesized with short end blocks, capable of hydrogen bonding (e.g., polypeptides). Compounding these materials with nanofillers will yield new ENTPEC nanocomposites. In order to control surface chemistry and patterning for improved tissue integration, a new  modular  approach using ElectroNanoSprayingTM is proposed, which allows the construction of gradient surfaces with various chemistries and topologies. Spraying ENTPE onto the surface of ENTPEC will yield well-controlled nanopatterns of the same chemistry.  Surface chemistry will be controlled by spraying low molecular weight (MW) functionalized PIBs (PIB-F)  where F is a biologically active compound (nucleic acid base, peptide, protein, etc.) onto the surface of ENTPECs. The PIB-Fs will be precision synthesized from PIB-OH made by living carbocationic polymerization and functionalized using a novel enzyme-catalyzed transesterification process that yields complete conversion under mild conditions  this also emerged from the current grant. The  modular  approach will give unprecedented control over surface chemistry and surface patterning independently, and will contribute to new fundamental understanding of the effects of surface properties on the biocompatibility of polymeric materials.  NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:This project is aimed at the synthesis and characterization of novel biomaterials based on polyisobutylene (PIB). These materials are soft and transparent like silicone rubber, but self-assemble into a network without any chemical treatment which is necessary to make silicone rubber. In 2004, one PIB-based material was FDA-approved as the coating on drug-eluting coronary stents. More than a million of those stents have been implanted into patients, saving lives. The proposed new materials will have improved combination of properties. In addition, a new approach to surface modification to improve biocompatibility will be tested in this project. For this goal new polymers will be synthesized via  green polymer chemistry  using enzymes as catalysts, and sprayed to the surface of the novel biomaterials. This new  modular  approach will give independent control over surface chemistry and patterning, providing unprecedented insight into the effect of these properties on biocompatibility. The new materials may replace silicone rubber in certain applications (for example, as the shell of breast implants where impermeability is required). This project is interdisciplinary, building on collaborators (Nanocopoeia Inc. Minnesota, BioMedical Research Associates Akron, the University of Washington, Pomeranian Medical Academy of Poland, University of Bordeaux, France). It is complementary to a recently approved grant by German Research Foundation (DFG) as well as the grant approved by the Polish Ministry of Science and Education, to test various properties of the new biomaterials. The grant will support 1 partial female Post-doctoral fellow (Nanocopoeia's NSF grant will complement this to full time), four Ph. D. students (3 Americans - two of them females, one Hispanic), future REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) students, an RET (Research Experience for Teachers), and high school students. It will also support international student exchanges and project meetings directly, and international students indirectly. The project will expose students to a great variety of scientific disciplines (polymer chemistry, organic chemistry, material science, biochemistry, surface science, polymer engineering, biomedical engineering, proteomics etc.). They will also have a chance to carry out part of their research in Germany, Poland and Ireland. Exposure to different cultures, organizations and work ethics will prepare the students to work better in the global economy, making them more attractive to potential employers. We will also embark on a new program connecting science and art, in collaboration with the Myers School of Art at the  to broaden the horizon for students of both disciplines\n"

The exhibit's conceptualization is anchored in the learning research vision of the NSF-funded workshop Cyberinfrastructure for Education and Learning for the Future (Computing Research Association, 2005).  The incorporation of VR and AR technologies into the Franklin Institute's electricity and Earth science exhibits is an innovation of traditional approaches to hands-on learning and will improve the quality of the learning experience for the primary audience of families with children and elementary school groups. The project has implications for future exhibit development and more broadly, will provide new research on learning on how to incorporate cyberlearning efforts into traditional exhibits. Fifteen participating exhibit developers across the ISE field will assist in the evaluation of the new exhibit; receive training on the design and development of VR and AR exhibits for their institutions; and receive full access to the exhibit's new software for implementation at their informal learning sites.  The technology applications will be developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center--leaders in the field in Virtual Reality design and development. Front-end and formative evaluation will be overseen internally by the Franklin Institute. The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the summative evaluation. Research will be conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education on the effects of AR and VR technologies on exhibit learning\",\n",

It will also build on an increased understanding of the importance of ECD to expand civic engagement around this urgent social issue. The overall goal of the project is to help its audiences understand child development, how environment and experiences impact development, and what we as a society can do to support our youngest citizens. Specifically, audiences will explore: How the brain develops from birth until kindergarten (or age five); how a childs environment and experiences sculpt the brain, with some experiences enhancing the child's self-control and learning, and other experiences that actually impede development; and what the project audiences can do to ensure that all children have a strong foundation to learn and thrive\",\n",

This interdisciplinary and inter-institutional team of researchers will (1) study electrical and opto-electronic properties of graphene-molecule-graphene and CNT-molecule-CNT devices with mechanical adjustability, electrolytic gating, and optical access; (2) use AFM and STM to characterize the molecule-graphene interface; and (3) use advanced laser microscopy to identify and excite individual electrically-contacted molecules. This work will be enabled by the development of novel experimental platforms and techniques, synthesis of molecular architectures of deliberate design and function, and the development of a theoretical framework. Fundamental chemical processes such as self-exchange rates in redox reactions, the distance dependence of electron transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer can all be studied by precisely modulating the spacing in graphene-molecule-graphene structures.These studies will provide the knowledge base to enable revolutionary advances in technologies such as energy conversion and storage, sensing, information technologies, and catalysis.

       " 'DRU: Integrated optimization of evacuation and sheltering for hurricanesPI: Rachel Davidson, University of Delaware (UD). Participating Institution: Cornell University.ABSTRACTThe goal of this project is to improve understanding of and decision support for evacuation and mass case sheltering in hurricanes. The task of moving tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from a wide geographic area in only a few days or hours under uncertain, dangerous conditions, getting them to safe locations, and keeping them safe until they can return home is an extraordinarily complicated process, and as Hurricane Katrina made abundantly clear, the stakes are high. Despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions assure us that many challenges remain. The traditional, conservative approach of evacuating everyone thought to be at risk is no longer feasible in many areas in which there are simply too many people and too little transportation capacity. We propose a fundamentally new approach. In the past, math modeling in this application has been limited to estimating the time required to clear a region, assuming many characteristics of the problem are uncontrollable input (e.g., shelter locations). Instead, we will develop sophisticated optimization models with an expanded decision frame that focuses on higher-level objectives, such as minimizing life loss, cost, and inequity, and considers the full range of strategic and operational evacuation and sheltering strategies in meeting those objectives, including for example, vertical evacuation and strategically locating shelters. These models will be developed through a tight interaction between sociologists and engineers to ensure they are firmly grounded in the reality of people?s behavior. For the first time, the models will be based on individual hurricane scenarios instead of conservative aggregations of many events, and they will be dynamic, accounting for the fact that officials can update their decisions as an event unfolds and information about the situation changes. The project has 5 main steps: (1) determine a set of hurricane scenarios for use in evacuation and shelter models such that they appropriately represent the full range of possible events, but are few enough to allow detailed analysis with each; (2) conduct focus groups of key decisionmakers and stakeholders to identify and characterize appropriate decision objectives, constraints, assumptions, and possible evacuation and shelter management strategies; (3) using the focus group input, develop two mathematical optimization models?one long-term strategic and one short-term operational?for evacuation and sheltering decisions; (4) conduct surveys of affected citizens to ensure that the optimization model assumptions and results make sense; and (5) demonstrate the models through case studies in North Carolina and Florida. Any evacuation and sheltering planning effort is only as effective as its weakest link, so it requires a broad range of expertise from marine science, transportation engineering, risk modeling, optimization, and behavioral research collaborating closely. We have assembled this expertise on the project team.This project will help begin to transform the way hurricane evacuation and sheltering are conducted in the U.S., addressing many of the known limitations of the current approach. The new understanding and optimization models developed in this project will help local and state emergency managers better plan for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, thus reducing the deaths, injuries, and unnecessary expense associated with poorly planned or executed response in future hurricanes. By collaborating throughout the project with state and local emergency management departments and the American Red Cross, the key agencies in charge of hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we will ensure that study results are disseminated to practitioners as quickly and effectively as possible. Three graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research, each with at least two of the co-PIs on their committees to ensure tight integration. By providing a substantive example of truly interdisciplinary disaster research, the project will help facilitate the transformation of the well-known Disaster Research Center, historically based in sociology, into an interdisciplinary center. It will also help to launch the new interdisciplinary graduate program in Disaster Science and Management at the University of Delaware',\n",

       " \"The overall goal of this project is to reconstruct the low-frequency behavior of the climatological Aleutian Low on decadal to millennial time scales, and to assess how its variability has related to past shifts in the mean state of climate during the Holocene. To confidently reconstruct past climate change, the inter-related processes that control the proxy climate indicators must be well understood. This project will continue on-going monitoring and lake-core-based investigations at nine lakes in southern Alaska with the dual aims of (1) understanding the primary controls on the sedimentary changes, and (2) applying this understanding to generate the highest quality time series of paleoclimate proxies that relate quantitatively to summer temperature and winter precipitation. The investigators recently discovered two lakes that contain annually laminated (varved) sediment. These are among the few varved lakes currently known in Alaska, and they present an opportunity to develop annually resolved time series of past climate variability. The low-frequency component of lamination thickness and grain-size variability at these glacier-fed lakes probably reflects the extent of ice cover in the catchment, while inter- and intra-annual variability is likely related to melt-season temperature and hydrologic factors, particularly large rainfall events. In addition to the new laminated lakes, this project will generate complementary records from lakes more suitable for ecologically based proxies, including chironomid and pollen/macrofossil assemblages, and lake-productivity indicators that respond to growing-season temperature. In addition, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms will be analyzed to reconstruct moisture-source variations, and geomorphic evidence will be used to assess Holocene glacier fluctuations within the lake catchments. The intellectual merit of this study includes its multi-proxy approach designed to probe a key feature of ocean-atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific: the Aleutian Low pressure system. This prominent center of action is linked to indices of climate variability across the Pacific. It is most strongly expressed in winter when it steers southwesterly storms inland, thereby governing the spatial pattern of surface temperature and snowfall across northwestern North America. This project includes glacier and glacial-lacustrine records because glacier size depends on winter precipitation, which varies with the Aleutian Low. Glacier size also depends on summer temperature necessitating complementary time series of summer temperature. The basic study design is to pair a glacial-fed lake (lamination record) with an organic-rich lake (chironomid record) in each of three study areas separated by 2100 km: Adak (middle Aleutian Islands) in the far west, Ahklun Mountains in the southwest, and Chugach Range in the Gulf of Alaska. These three areas straddle the prominent dipole in the influence of the Aleutian Low. When the Aleutian Low strengthens, winter precipitation and temperature increase in the Gulf of Alaska, while it decreases in the west. Moisture sources also shift with the Aleutian Low, and these are recorded in the oxygen-isotope ratios of lake water and the diatoms that grow within it. The multi-proxy time series will extend through the Holocene, with higher-resolution analyses over two periods that encompass past warm intervals, namely the Holocene thermal maximum, which took place early during the current epoch, and the last 2000 years, which includes the so-called medieval warm period, a key benchmark for 20th century warmth.The broader impacts of this study involve its synergistic activities with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a premier environmental monitoring program in the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, geoscientists at the US Geological Survey's Alaska Volcano Observatory who are striving to assess the frequency of eruptions of Aleutian Arc volcanoes and to identify widespread tephra-stratigraphic markers, and the broader community of multi- and inter-disciplinary scientists aiming to understand the causes and effects of climatic change around the North Pacific, the Arctic, and globally. This project contributes to understanding climatic variability, a key challenge facing society. The US Climate Change Science Program identifies  Past Climate Variability and Change in the Arctic and at High Latitudes  as one of its primary research objectives. The project is training three graduate and several undergraduate students in global-change research, and supports a Research Assistant Professor in her early career.

In the modern era, issues of security command the attention of policymakers and the general public, both within the U.S. and beyond. Surveillance has become the key mechanism employed in both public and private sectors to contend with the uncertainty raised by threats of terrorism and other criminal activities. With the rise in surveillance apparatuses and security forces, however, public concerns have multiplied, not only about the cost and efficacy of such safeguards, but also about encroachments upon privacy, civil liberties, and public spaces. These tensions have not gone unnoticed by social scientists and humanities scholars studying surveillance.The objectives of these two three-day workshops are 1) to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on contemporary surveillance issues, 2) to map core areas of surveillance research to locate collaborative opportunities and existing research gaps, and 3) to facilitate graduate student training. The choice of participants will provide a balanced representation of both junior and senior scholars, disciplinary training, and international perspectives.

       " 'Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease',\n",
       " 'The United States over the past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards across a wide variety of technologies, and a dramatic increase in the volume of patent litigation between rivals. Numerous commentators have suggested that the proliferation of these awards, known as  patent thickets , has had socially detrimental consequences since overlapping intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new innovations. Patent pools, which can be defined as formal or informal organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties, have been proposed as a way in which firms can address these  patent thicket  problems. Patent pools have been most plentiful and well established for decades in the information technology and communications industries. In the past few years, the biomedical research community has expressed increasing interest in patent pools as a potential solution for increasingly prevalent patent licensing issues in biotechnology-related fields. This project builds on the existing work on patent pools, trying to understand how the issues faced in the biomedical industries are similar and different to the issues in information technology and communication. The project combines empirical and theoretical research in this endeavor in an academically rigorous manner. The project is deepening our understanding of a crucial  knowledge-sharing organization , an institution, like a standard-setting organizations or open source project, where firms can strategically share knowledge. BROADER IMPACTS For scientists and others interested in innovation policy, this project advances understanding of how patent thicket problems can be addressed, and the strategies that are most likely to be effective (as well as more problematic approaches). The project leaders are ensuring that the findings of the study are diffused in a variety of outreach efforts, in order to insure that the ideas can have the most impact. This takes several forms. First, the project leaders are involving practitioners as well as life scientists in the academic conference that is being organized on this topic. As in earlier projects, the project leaders are participating in the public policy process, explaining their findings. Finally, the project leaders are disseminating the ideas more broadly through outreach to the popular press',\n",

       " 'This multidisciplinary project draws upon sociology, computer science, and linguistics to study how ideas are created and propagate through scientific communities, how these communities are formed and change over time, and how multidisciplinary networks spanning these communities shape scientific innovation. It creates sophisticated new computational models for extracting and representing ideas and measuring their impact and novelty, and for extracting and representing social relations and identifying forms of multidisciplinary collaboration. Its methods integrate the network analytic tools of social science with the language processing tools of computer science. It uses network analysis to improve the ability of computational tools to identify ideas in scientific texts, as well as the tools of computational linguistics to help explain the co-evolution of scientific collaborations and innovations. The models of ideas and their diffusion can be used to investigate hypotheses such as whether multidisciplinary research accelerates or decelerates scientific innovation, and how multidisciplinarity influences student and faculty careers. A relatively shallow but large-scale study of the MEDLINE corpus is combined with a richer organization-level study of Stanford University faculty (their publications, grants, affiliations, advising, and teaching) in order to explore and analyze the complex interrelationships of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration.The research agenda of this project is to produce new and unique data, create new computational tools, and extend theory so that scholars change their conceptions of scientific innovation, multidisciplinarity, and research communities more generally. The integration of social network and natural language processing techniques is helping to develop a new vein of research in computational social science, simultaneously offering empirical rigor and scale to the sociology of science and extending natural language processing from its previous engineering focus toward true explanatory social science models',\n",

       " 'The overall goal of this project is to investigate joint influences of genetic propensities and social-control on delinquent behavior. Previous sociological work has demonstrated the critical importance of social structural conditions, family processes, school structure, and peer networks.  These serve as informal social controls that bond individuals to social norms and ultimately may reduce delinquency.  The project draws data sources from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address the question of why some individuals become serious and violent delinquents while others do not, despite growing up in a similar social context and participating in similar social processes.  Dr. Guo and his research teams will investigate the role of genetic propensities, especially as they interact with social control factors, in delinquency.  Specifically, they will use genotype data focusing on the genes that are known to be involved in aggressive behavior in mice to explore how genetic factors might influence delinquency and how those influences may depend on social control processes measured at the levels of friends, peers, family, school, and neighborhood.  This research is based on the premise that genetic effects on delinquency are best understood within a social science theoretical framework, which provides the basis for understanding delinquent behavior as socially produced and socially organized human activity. The newly created molecular genotype data will be merged with the rich social and behavioral longitudinal data in Add Health for other researchers to use.  The results of this study would contribute to the understanding of aggression and delinquency across the life course and could inform intervention efforts',\n",

       " \"Scientists, inventors, writers, and other creators have attested to the importance of inspiration in the creative process. In contrast, creativity researchers have generally dismissed the concept of inspiration, arguing that ascription of creative insight to the intervention of a supernatural source ( muse ) is outmoded myth. However, it is possible to reconcile creators' accounts of inspiration with contemporary science. Specifically, consistent with creators' accounts, inspiration is posited to be an effect of creative insight, not its cause; inspiration is posited to be a motivational state that is aroused in response to a creative insight and that compels the individual to translate the creative insight into a creative product. This perspective exposes an important gap in the research literature. Creativity researchers have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive, neurological, and contextual origins of creative insight (thus debunking the notion of Muse) but have largely ignored the state of inspiration that promotes the translation of creative insights into creative products. This oversight is striking, because the failure to translate creative ideas into tangible products is likely to be among the most important obstacles to innovation. This project involves three primary goals. The first goal is to develop methods for the assessment of inspiration and to provide evidence of their validity. Several methods of assessment are being developed, including self-report questionnaires and objective indicators derived, for instance, from digital video of nonverbal behaviors and from electronic monitoring of the creative process. The second goal is to demonstrate that inspiration is a robust predictor of creativity and other socially valued outcomes, including work productivity and efficiency. Several types of creative activity are examined, including invention, scientific writing, and the writing of poetry. In each case, creativity is assessed objectively (e.g., receipt of patents) or through a peer-review process. The third goal is to establish the functional significance of inspiration by integrating it with contemporary theories of personality and human motivation. For instance, the personality traits that predict the creativity of an initial insight are expected to be fundamentally different from the traits that predict the tendency to become inspired to actualize the insight. In addition, mysterious aspects of the subjective experience of inspiration, such as the feeling that one is functioning as the mouthpiece of a power beyond oneself, are expected to be explained by the involvement of implicit (unconscious) processes.This project will have important impacts beyond advancing the motivation, inspiration, and creativity research literatures. For instance, the findings will be widely disseminated in the form of research articles, book chapters, and conference presentations; tools for the assessment of inspiration, known to be predictive of creativity, productivity, and efficiency, will be available for use in the workplace and in educational settings; and policy makers and others concerned with societal adaptation to changing physical and sociopolitical environments will be equipped with well-validated models of the processes through which innovative and transformative ideas are translated into concrete products and solutions\",\n",
       " 'This proposed project is an empirical study that falls within the contextual research strand of the REESE program.  The aim is to conduct research about STEM education relative to achievement gaps that exist between minority and disadvantaged students and their non-minority counterparts. The outcomes of this study will help in addressing the convergence of several trends that may exact increasing costs to individuals on the lower end of the gap, the economy, and to social and political ideas.   The achievement gap is a deceptively complex scientific problem that will increasingly require studying the origin and evolution of gaps from earliest childhood.  In that regard, this study will integrate research trends in the developmental sciences, the cognitive and neurosciences and economics, and education research and other strands of social science to develop interventions to address gaps in more efficient ways. The first large nationally representative longitudinal data collection will be used for this study.  This large database includes information from nine months to grade eight that will be used to test and compare the leading hypotheses about the origin and evolution of gaps.  To meet the challenge of turning such data into credible evidence that might inform intervention plans and further research, two statistical estimation strategies (growth and econometric models), information from supporting meta-analysis, and an extensive advisory network of experts will be used to conduct the study.  The research will focus on: (1) Building better theoretical and empirical research models directed toward understanding how these gaps develop from conception to school entry; (2) Identifying effective strategies and inventions that might efficiently narrow gaps prior to school entry; (3) Building better explanations about why gaps are so difficult to close during schooling; (4) formulating stronger suggestions about why gaps for some minority groups expand during schooling, while gaps for other minority students narrow; and (5) Identifying the conditions associated with significant positive changes in learning trajectories during schooling for the small proportion of minority and disadvantaged students who narrow their score differences with white advantaged students.Broader Impacts: The study is likely to advance knowledge and discovery in the field in that it brings together researchers from many fields to examine ways to better understand the achievement gap in STEM areas.  The results could benefit education stakeholders interested in improving STEM education for all students.  Potentially, this study could inform and influence current policy considerations regarding mandatory pre-school enrollment, and in that regard could be transformative.  State and local policymakers will assist with dissemination as well as national outlets established through earlier studies',\n",

Biomolecules such as these are of increasing health and security concern to society and this program will help to open new approaches to mitigation and treatment. Investigating ARG directly as pollutants using genome-enabled tools, rather than culture-based methods, is an innovative aspect of this research. For the past two years the PI has been studying the spread of ARG in the front range Colorado watershed, which provides an excellent model system for studying the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment because the primary source is snowmelt with minimal anthropogenic input. Thus the PI is uniquely poised to succeed in this research and to make significant contributions to the field. Institutional support is substantial, including newly renovated labs, reduced teaching loads, TA support, travel funding, and mentoring.The intellectual merit of this project will provide a firm foundation for teaching, training and learning.  New courses that integrate MB&B into the engineering curriculum will be further developed, evaluated, and improved. Inquiry-based learning and peer-learning with a laboratory component will be especially valuable for training engineers in an interdisciplinary field. MERGE activities will also specifically address the need for representation of women and minorities by focusing on topics that have been demonstrated to attract underrepresented groups. Graduate students will also benefit from MERGE by actively participating as mentors to undergraduate students and in taking the lead in publishing and presenting the results of their research. Furthermore, students will help organize K-12 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) outreach activities. Results will be broadly disseminated through conducting workshops in partnership with other Colorado/Wyoming universities and withEuropean collaborators (University of Barcelona and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique).  Finally, the overall results will be summarized as best management practices (BMPs), which will be a helpful practical guide to farming and water professionals. The activities are considered to be beneficial  to society in that they will take an important step in involving environmental engineers in helping solve a critical problem that has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most pressing health issues of this century',\n",
       " \"This project involves the study of Galois groups of extensions of global fields obtained by adjoining preimages of a rational point under iterates of a morphism of varieties.  The inverse limit of all such groups for a given point and morphism form what we call an arboreal Galois representation.  Piecemeal results on these representations have existed for some 20 years, but the PI has recently developed a more unified theory, and discovered several new applications. These include properties of the p-adic Mandelbrot set, sets of prime divisors of non-linear recurrences, and reductions of a given point on an abelian algebraic group. The PI plans to pursue applications further, into the domain of dynamics over finite fields, which is a natural direction. Several cryptographic algorithms, including the Pollard rho algorithm, make use of dynamics over finite fields, and the research proposed here is likely to have applications in this area. Further research plans include the determination of the image of arboreal representations in certain analogues to the case of CM elliptic curves; the further development of the analogy between arboreal representations and linear Galois representations, with the ultimate goal of attaching interesting L-functions to arboreal representations; and finally, an examination of irreducibility properties of iterates of polynomials with integral coefficients.Generally speaking, this projects blends ideas from two a priori different fields, number theory and dynamics.  The study of extensions of the rational numbers Q by algebraic numbers -- that is, roots of polynomials-- is one of the most basic areas of number theory.  The field of dynamics seeks to understand how processes evolve over time, and the most basic dynamical system consists of repeated application (or iteration, as it'sknown) of a map f from a space to itself.  The PI proposes to study the extensions of Q obtained by adjoining roots of iterates of certain polynomials.  Of particular interest are the Galois groups of such fields, namely the group of field automorphisms fixing pointwise the base field. When the Galois groups of all iterates of a single function are taken together, we term it an arboreal Galois representation.  Even in seemingly simple cases such as the polynomial x^2 - 1, this arboreal representation is not well understood.  These representations turn out to encode density information regarding a variety of dynamical phenomena.  Moreover, they furnish an interesting and potentially fruitful analogue to the well-studied case of linear l-adic Galois representations, namely the study of fields whose Galois groups embed in certain matrix groups. These have had a myriad of important applications\",\n",

A central and persistent problem confronting biomaterials design is the uncontrolled adsorption of proteins to material surfaces. There is currently no general consensus on how to design a protein-resistant coating.  A major gap in current knowledge is the limited understanding of the basic mechanisms of protein adsorption to polymer interfaces in aqueous media. Absent this information, it is difficult to define engineering approaches to control specific behavior. This research plan will address this knowledge gap by using a combination of synthetic chemistry and complementary experimental approaches that probe the mechanisms by which proteins interact with grafted polymers. In Objective 1, polymer gradients will be used as high throughput screening platforms to identify polymer brush properties that support protein adsorption. In Objective 2, a combination of fluorescence techniques will quantify the diffusivity of adsorbed proteins as a function of the brush parameters. In Objective 3, neutron reflectivity measurements with deuterated proteins will determine where adsorbed proteins localize relative to the polymer brush. Finally, Objective 4 will quantify the magnitude and range of attractive and repulsive forces between proteins and polymers that are responsible for protein adsorption behavior.  The work will help to develop an understanding of the interactions of proteins with polymer brushes and could advance the design and preparation of surfaces resistant to protein adsorption and biofouling.BROADER IMPACTS:  Success of this project will shed new and useful light on the mechanisms by which polymer brush coatings may protect surfaces from unwanted protein adsorption.  With respect to broadening participation, the project will continue the PI's on-going efforts to involve students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering in the research endeavor.  These efforts will include inclusion of females and underrepresented minorities in graduate level research and participation in the Summer Research Opportunity Program that provides opportunities for minority undergraduate students to participate in research\",\n",

       " 'Species in the carabid beetle genus Paussus (340 species) exhibit an extraordinary diversity of unique morphological structures, in part because they are obligate symbionts of ants (i.e., myrmecophiles). The taxonomy of Paussus is in a state of turmoil, as evinced by multiple contradictory classifications of the group. This is to some degree due to the striking phenotypic uniqueness of these beetles, which tends to obscure similarities that can be used to infer evolutionary relationships between species. The objectives of this project are to: (1) infer the evolutionary relationships within Paussus based on DNA sequence data; (2) examine the evolution of morphological characters using the resulting phylogenetic framework; (3) produce a novel species-group classification within Paussus and an electronic interactive key to those species groups; (4) produce a systematic revision of those species of Paussus endemic to Madagascar, one of the most diverse and threatened regions of the world; and, (5) provide georeferenced biodiversity data to environmental non-profit organizations and governmental agencies in Madagascar for science-based conservation planning. The phylogeny produced with this research will provide a stable evolutionary framework for the proposed systematic revision of the Malagasy fauna, as well as for all future revisions and biogeographic analyses within the genus. Analyses of character evolution will reveal patterns of evolution of some very unusual traits associated with myrmecophily. Distributional and life history data, species- and higher-level classifications, phylogenetic hypotheses, and paper and web-based identification tools will be made available to ecologists and conservation biologists as facilitated by Réseau de la Biodiversité de Madagascar (REBIOMA).

       " \"This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition. Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen & Soskice 2006, Persson & Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout.

Successful use of AVs depends on both the availability of quality educational materials and their proper deployment. The field of AV has progressed little from the mid 1990s in terms of adoption levels or total educational impact. Many developers are not making use of lessons learned. Since effective ways of developing and deploying AVs are known, these difficulties can be overcome by a cohesive community of AV developers and users. The goal of this project is to build this community. The first step to building this community is to establish a steering committee of active members in the field who help to guide creation of an integrated collection of resources and infrastructure to serve as a communications hub and information clearing house. These resources leverage the progress already made by AV developers and users to bring about wider adoption and greater successful impact in the classroom.The intellectual merit is the improvement of the computer science education community's understanding of how AVs can be made pedagogically effective. The broader impact is improving on the general availability and quality of AVs, which can affect the educational outcomes for many students every year in computer science and related disciplines.

       " 'Eye tracking has become a widespread tool throughout the cognitive sciences and has attracted particular attention as a behavioral measurement tool for children with developmental disabilities. However, there are no standardized quantitative tools for assessing broadly defined attention skills in young children, and there is a lack of analysis techniques that would allow gaze patterns to be compared across individuals, across populations, or for a single individual across time.  This study will develop methods of quantitatively measuring attentional capacities by (1) designing a Visual Attention Assessment Suite (VAAS) which examines the interaction and impact of particular features of scenes on visual attention; (2) constructing novel computational analysis techniques for comparing gaze patterns across individuals, populations, and time; (3) validating these techniques against both standard behavioral assessment protocols and through an embodied modeling approach to ensure that our models capture the behaviorally important aspects of gaze.  The regulation of attention has been hypothesized as one of the fundamental factors affecting early development of children with autism.  This project will develop quantitative measures that can be used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and to evaluate the effectiveness of particular treatment approaches.  This project represents the first integrated and interdisciplinary attempt to develop a much needed full-scale diagnostic instrument that operates purely through eye-tracking, computational techniques, and individual modeling.   Although our primary focus is the interpretation of gaze data with respect to autism, eye tracking is used extensively in psychology, primatology, usability studies, marketing, and human-computer interaction experiments.  The models and analysis tools constructed under this project will be equally applicable to these other domains.  This project also has the potential to produce novel methods of assessing attentional abnormalities in other developmental disorders (e.g., mental retardation, attention deficit disorder, specific learning disabilities), novel educational assessment methods of pre-kindergarten readiness, as well as to develop training methods for teaching clinicians and educators behavioral assessment using a robot as a model illustrating various attentional patterns in children with disabilities',\n",

       " \"A tree has been the organizing image to explain the relationships among living creatures since before Darwin's explanations for natural descent. The modern practice of comparing DNA and protein sequences to discern these relationships, however, has revealed complexities in the process of descent never before imagined. Organisms, particularly microbes, evolve by horizontal as well as vertical inheritance of traits with different groups of organisms exchanging genes, in addition to passing them down to the next generation. This research project addresses the question: Can the large scale structure of the tree/web of life be discerned? While the current data may be interpreted to mean that the depiction of life's history as a single bifurcating tree is incomplete, this should not be seen as justification to give up on reconstructing life's history. The working hypothesis underlying this research is that a reconstruction of life's early history is indeed possible, provided care is taken to guard against artifacts and that new, informative molecular characters are added to the analyses. Four complementary approaches will be used to address the question through analyses of microbial genome sequences. (1) Genome sequence data will be examined to find ancient horizontal gene transfer events that created useful taxonomic characters. An automated genome analysis pipeline will be developed to find these events, and these characters will be incorporated into new examinations of evolutionary relationships. (2) Complete genome sequences allow comparisons of all the genes of an organism with those of others to measure their evolutionary relatedness. However, the impact of horizontal acquisition of genes on these analyses is unknown. Computer simulations and genome sequences from two unrelated groups of microbes that have undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer, the Haloarchaea and the Thermotogales, will be used to gauge the extent to which different phylogenomic approaches are impacted by highways of gene sharing between different groups of organisms. (3) A public database will be constructed to store information on all putatively identified gene transfer events. This database will be a valuable resource for the wider scientific community to trace the role of gene transfer in the assembly of metabolic pathways and to examine the adaptation of organisms to new ecological niches. (4) The nature of the last common ancestor of all living creatures, the trunk of the tree of life, has been difficult to discern given all the changes in nucleotide composition that have occurred during evolutionary time. A compositional analysis will be used to detect the remaining signal of the genetic code's expansion that occurred early in life's history in order to  root  the tree of life. These in-depth analyses of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes will offer insights into the impacts of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution and phylogenetic reconstructions, as well as identify natural groups in the tree of life and help to resolve its deep structure. Unraveling the structure of the tree of life will have percussions in all fields of biology.This research program and its associated education activities will provide an ideal training ground in which high school, undergraduate, and graduate students along with postdoctoral fellows can learn about genome and organismal evolution. Plans are for three postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, and about twenty undergraduate and high school students to be trained through computational and laboratory research experiences. The goal is to train computer scientists and biologists to become experts in their respective disciplines and to become effective in trans-disciplinary communication; thereby enabling successful interdisciplinary collaborations.

       " 'Channel bifurcations, wherein one channel splits into two, are the building blocks of braided, anastomosed, and distributary channel networks. Recent work has shown that the most common flow partitioning at bifurcations is asymmetric, and that this asymmetry seems to promote stability. Why and under what hydrographic and sedimentologic conditions this should be so, remain a puzzle. Here we propose an integrated field and theoretical investigation of the morphology, flow, and sedimentary processes of higher shear-stress, natural river bifurcations, with the objective of understanding and predicting their dynamical behavior. The field studies will be conducted to encompass two bifurcating systems with different sedimentation characteristics: i) distributary channel bifurcations of the Mossy Delta of the Saskatchewan River, where we have conducted pilot studies concerning bifurcation morphodynamics, and ii) bifurcations within the Wax Lake delta system, Louisiana, where active sedimentation is leading to rapid distributary channel growth. Several bifurcations at each site will be chosen to span a range of morphologic types. Bed morphology, water surface topography, flow velocity, and sediment transport rate will be measured at each bifurcation on a closely spaced grid at several flow stages. The field data will provide boundary and initial conditions for numerical experiments designed to define the processes and morphological conditions that lead to inherently unstable bifurcations, and detail the controlling boundary conditions for stability. Earlier numerical models will be improved by using Delft3D-FLOW, a morphodynamic model that accounts for: (1) three-dimensional turbulent unsteady, nonuniform flow, (2) interaction between bed topography, flow, and both bedload and suspended load, and (3) morphodynamically interacting erodible banks and bed. Numerical experiments will allow us to determine the feedback processes that promote stable bifurcations and predict which channel configurations are stable in the face of perturbations. We aim to yield a stability diagram for channel bifurcations and assess the influence of barform dynamics and downstream channel change in influencing bifurcation stability. A better understanding and predictive capability of channel bifurcation behavior would improve flood forecasting, planning and development of floodplain and channel structures, channel designs, and the success of stream restoration efforts. The results of this study also will advance our knowledge of when and where river avulsions will take. Insofar as it is transformative, it will resolve the differences among competing stability theories, and produce a model, constrained by the best-available field data, which can be used to predict the stability and behavior of these ubiquitous hydrologic and geomorphic nodes.

       " \"Understanding how animals perceive and act upon complex natural environments is one of the most pressing challenges in neuroscience, with applications that have potential to revolutionize not only our understanding of the brain, but also machine vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Until now, studying the neural basis of active vision - how visual stimuli give rise to eye movements under diverse task conditions - has largely been restricted to simplified laboratory stimuli, presented to overtrained animals performing stereotypical tasks. With funding from the National Science Foundation, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Dr. Douglas Munoz at Queens University in Canada and Dr. Laurent Itti at the University of Southern California will combine neurophysiology and computational modeling to investigate free viewing in natural environments. Using multi-electrode arrays, this project will record in a deep brain structure, called the superior colliculus (SC). The SC is a layered structure comprising several well-understood neural maps, from purely sensory representations in the superficial layers, to sensorimotor representations linked to the control of eye movements in the deeper layers. The project will start by characterizing responses of neurons in the SC under simple stimulus conditions: When the animal is simply looking at a central fixation cross on a display while small isolated patterns are presented at other visual locations; when the animal searches for an oddball item among an array of distracting items; and when the animal inspects natural images and video clips. The  project will extend the investigators' salience map theories and models, and develop a new model of the SC. The complete model will predict, from any image or video clip, which visual locations are more salient, task-relevant, and candidate targets for eye movements.The project leverages a cross-disciplinary collaboration between a neurophysiology lab (co-PI Douglas P. Munoz) and a computational modeling lab (PI Laurent Itti). This will allow, through the combination of experiments and modeling, the interpretation of an otherwise undecipherable mass of data collected during natural viewing. Conversely, the theories will guide further experiments. Coupling multi-unit recording with modeling during free-viewing of natural videos has never been attempted before, and it is expected that it will lead to new understanding of how percepts map into actions under natural conditions. The project will support undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, who will benefit from exposure to combined physiological and computational techniques, as will the investigators' teaching. In addition to publications, all theory and algorithm source code will be freely distributed, and data will be available through the CRCNS data sharing web site. This research is hence expected to lead to new and broadly accessible fundamental advances in the understanding of how animals use visual information to guide behavior, and how one could build machines which act in similar ways when faced with the complex natural world\",\n",
       " 'This study is intended to develop better understanding of why changes in reform-based practices in higher education are slow to develop.  The project aims to increase understanding of the relationship between mental models of faculty about effective pedagogy in STEM fields and the extent of consensus about such pedagogy. The research will also examine individual and institutional factors that may influence mental models and consensus and the individual and group level factors that are related to teaching practices and changes in cognitive structure and consensus over time. The study will use cognitive frameworks to explain institutional inertia and will develop methodological approaches to examine several different units of analysis using both cognitive and cultural frameworks.  The investigators will create an evaluation design that will be tested in higher education institutions.  It will describe the mental models held by individual faculty about effective pedagogy, describe the groups that have consensus on these structures, and describe how individuals and institutions vary in teaching approaches.   The study will measure changes in faculty views of pedagogical practices over time by following faculty over time.  Data will be gathered from faculty in math, life science and physical sciences over a three year period. The primary source of data will be a survey instrument given in the first and third year. There will also be in-dept interviews with subsets of faculty',\n",
       " \"The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry. Specifically, a combination of methodologies ranging from geometric scale-space theory to singularity theory and geometric variational principles, combined with optimal algorithms for computing special curves on surfaces, will be exploited to derive a complete and automatic analysis of the topography at multiple relevant scales\",\n",

       " \"This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]This project uses a new national survey with which to systematically measure American welfare attitudes in cross-national perspective. This research has two complementary goals. One is to field for the first time core items from the highly successful European Social Survey (ESS) to better enable comparisons between European nations and the United States. Cross-nationally standardized items are essential to survey measurement, and this project will build from the ESS data collection, extending measurement of welfare attitudes to the key case of the United States. The project's second thematic goal is to make use of an experimental design in which hypotheses about causal sources of welfare state attitudes can be adjudicated. Embedded survey experiments hold considerable promise in advancing scholarly understanding of attitude and preference formation. The dual focus of this project is on framing (in which the description of a social policy or its beneficiaries are varied) and sponsorship (in which the source of these descriptions are varied). Together, framing and sponsorship are essential elements of social and historical context that are typically held constant in opinion surveys. Building from the conventional social survey, the methodological benefit of survey experiments is to unpack these elements of context so that hypotheses about specific frames and competing sponsors can be evaluated. This project and data collection provides American and European scholars with a new survey with which to evaluate how and why social policy attitudes vary in the contemporary historical era. It provides for the principal investigator and larger European research team (of which this project is the United States component) the data with which to conduct survey based individual and multi-level analysis. Subsequent research projects are expected to offer novel explanations of why mass opinion on social welfare continues to differ across the worlds most developed nations. In fielding embedded survey experiments, this project offers new insights into mechanisms behind the formation of policy preferences. These experiments contribute to a firmer understanding of the United States in cross-national perspective. It is hoped that knowledge generated through these experiments may stimulate further applications of experimental surveys in cross-national research\",\n",
       " 'The proposed workshop, to be held at the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery, aims to capitalize on a major new direction in research on formal models of human cognition, exploring probabilistic models of learning and cognitive development. The technical advances that have been made in the use of probabilistic models over the last twenty years in statistics, computer science, and machine learning have made this research enterprise possible, resulting in a set of mathematical and computational tools that can be used to build explicit models of psychological phenomena. By indicating the conclusions that a rational learner might draw from the data provided by experience, Bayesian models can be used to investigate how nature and nurture contribute to human knowledge. Although computational models have been used to aid empirical research on learning in the past, the lack of communication and collaboration between formal theorists and experimental laboratories has always been a stumbling block. This workshop will bring together two groups of researchers: experts in computational modeling and scientists studying cognitive development. The goal is both to report and to discuss the progress we have made so far with existing collaborative research and to foster future collaborations between computational scientists and learning researchers, leading to new insights and new models of how people learn and develop. A special emphasis will be placed on developing strategies of the application of these insights to educational research and practice',\n",

To meet the growing need for engineering teachers in Texas, and to serve as a model in engineering education across the nation, UTeachEngineering has the following four professional development pathways to teacher preparedness, two for in-service teachers and two for pre-service teachers:     1.  UTeach Master of Arts in Science and Engineering Education (MASEE);     2.  Engineering Summer Institutes for Teachers (ESIT);     3.  Engineering Certification Track for Physics Majors; and     4.  Teacher Preparation Track for Engineering Majors. Key elements of the four UTeachEngineering pathways are four new engineering courses focusing on engineering content and pedagogy: Fundamentals in Engineering and Design, Knowing and Learning in Engineering, Engineering Energy Systems, and Design of Machines and Systems.  Leveraging these four courses in combination with existing UTeach pedagogical courses, UTeachEngineering anticipates reaching 650 teachers (80 pre-service and 570 in-service) over the first five years.  In the future, it is expected that UTeachEngineering will be sustained as a vital program at the University of Texas at Austin.UTeachEngineering is firmly rooted in current research in the field of engineering education and affords a much-needed opportunity to study the teaching and learning of engineering.  During the development phase, UTeachEngineering is examining impacts on three specific groups: (1) Engineers involved in the creation of curricular materials and course design, (2) participants (current and future teachers) enrolled in the engineering courses, and (3) the students of these teachers.  While the focused goal of UTeachEngineering is to train a cadre of secondary teachers, the project's vision is that all students are  engineering enabled,  acquiring the design and interaction skills that would enable them to be successful in an engineering career should they choose one, while enhancing their lives and participation as global citizens even if they do not become engineers\",\n",

Over the last decade these effects have increasingly been recognized to be important in ocean systems. Identifying sites and times where these metals cause negative environmental outcomes is greatly hampered by their comparatively sparse datasets. This problem is a direct consequence of the analytical challenge of obtaining accurate Fe and Cu determinations in saline waters at very low (trace) concentrations, and the limitations of ship-dependent sampling regimes. The PI's request funding to build on research and technology advances in the Tripp, Wells and King laboratories to develop active nanostructures that can serve as platforms amenable for detection of a wide range of environmentally important dissolved metals in seawater. Preliminary work has validated a biologically-inspired sensor platform in the subarctic N. Pacific, providing the first demonstration of dissolved Fe measurements at very low (Broader Impacts:This project has the potential to further develop a sensor that will provide unique information about the chemical speciation of the biologically important metals Fe and Cu. The work proposed here fills an important need for high spatial and temporal resolution data of these metals identified as priority by researchers in marine chemistry and marine biogeochemistry. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to fill an analytical void for data that continues to stymie efforts to understand how and Cu and more specifically Fe availability in the oceans modulates the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the marine environment. The proposal is well balanced in its goal of marrying nanotechnology with IR spectroscopy to address a analytical void while providing specific support for the training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

College Ready intends to build vertical and horizontal learning communities among school and college faculty in order to improve major articulation issues that impact the successful transition of students from high school to college.  College Ready focuses its work on a number of critical junctures and therefore is centered on articulation issues between school and college - teacher preparation in college for work in schools and student preparation in school for college mathematics and science - and among colleges and disciplines.The major intents of College Ready are to:1)  Prepare students for college success, especially in STEM Areas    a.  Smooth the transition to college by improved articulation    b.  Provide improved placement mechanisms for college mathematics2)  Enhance teacher capacity to deliver rigorous, successful courses and      curricula    a.  Build learning communities of school and college faculty    b.  Sort out and negotiate competing standards and accountabilities3)  Build vertical and horizontal learning communities to improve articulation 4)  Prepare teachers to serve as curriculum and pedagogy leaders who can    a.  serve as peer mentors to fellow teachers    b.  encourage pedagogy that is correctly connected to content, and     c.  create synergism between mathematics and science classes 5)  Make effective learning resources available, including the production of    supporting materials for ongoing professional development and embedded     English Language Learner (ELL) instruction 6)  Strengthen pre-service education7)  Improve the number of pre- and postsecondary teachers, including     recruitment and retention.Ultimately, College Ready will demonstrate an impact on student outcomes through decreases in college remediation rates in mathematics, increases in student proficiency scores on state assessments, increased numbers of students enrolling in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics and physics courses and scoring 3 or better on the AP exams, and increased graduation and college-going rates.College Ready will achieve these ends through a series of interconnected activities including vertical alignment of high school and college expectations, intensive content driven workshops, articulation conferences, university course revisions, the creation of professional learning communities, and the opportunity to earn advanced degrees and endorsements.  It builds on and looks to establish synergy between established efforts of PhysTEC and PMET. The College Ready endeavors are complemented by a set of three research questions to be pursued:  Is there a unifying construct in the way units are used in physics, economics, public discourse, and in 9-14 mathematics? What measures best determine college readiness and placement in mathematics, and how can placement testing in mathematics be better aligned with high school curricula?

This will be achieved through a series of laboratory testing complemented with advanced computer modeling. The specific research objectives focus on assessing how wall made out of earth bricks can be engineered for optimal performance with respect to: 1) Water vapor permeability; 2) Hygroscopicity, and; 3) Capillarity.

The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.

It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether surface states could explain the recently observed magneto-transport behavior in bulk Bi.  Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies',\n",
       " \"People's perceptual judgments and actions depend on the pick-up of informative energy patterns arriving at the senses. As examples, a driver's detection of certain optical variables informs the decision of whether it is safe to pass another car; another variable might inform the driver whether the current braking action will stop the car in time, or if force on the brake needs to be increased. One key function of perceptual and perceptual-motor learning is to change the variables that the perceiver-actor attends to in making their judgments or in controlling their actions. Perceiver-actors educate their attention to variables that permit more accurate judgments and more effective motor activities. A central question, however, is how perceivers improve. While experience can make clear that judgments and actions are not accurate and that change is needed, until recently it has been unclear how (or if) experience actually directs the improvement. A new theory, called direct learning, lays out how change is guided by information. The current project explores: How should one arrange a perceptual learning situation so that learning proceeds as quickly and accurately as possible? Can perceptual learning be shown to be indifferent to the probabilistic value of sensory information? Does learning to detect some information entail exploratory movements that create it? If so, can goal-directed movement also be aimed at information-production? The findings could have broad practical applications to attempts to train perceiver-actors to discriminate objects (letters, faces, aircraft), events (deceptive intention, impending collisions), and to control movements (aircraft landing, skilled athletic or dance performance\",\n",

Additionally, the fiber will be deployed outside the borehole casing. The strainmeter will be deployed at the Piñon Flat Observatory (PFO) to compare data with existing strain-measuring instrument packages. A goal of this development is to extend the useful measurement frequency range. Strain is an integral part of understanding fundamental tectonic processes in the surface crust. An existing borehole at PFO will be used and data will be compared and validated against horizontal strain volume from existing sensors. The interferometric processing system has already been developed. Two main intellectual goals are sought: 1) to improve and evaluate the prototype instrument design and performance, and 2) to thoroughly test the assumption vertical strain can be related to horizontal strain through existing models.

       " 'Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D. This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty. The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models',\n",

       " \"A compelling issue that emerged from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report,  AR4, in 2007 was the interest in  short term  climate projections out to about 2030.  This is a time frame of interest for many decision support activities and impacts, but is not explicitly addressed with current models and experiments.  Any short-term climate information currently provided is simply taken from relatively coarse grid global coupled climate models in the early stages of 21st century simulations that began in the late 1800s and are run to 2100 and beyond.  While this provides some information regarding the response of the climate system to external forcing on near-term time scales, it has recently been recognized that a different type of experiment using models with higher spatial resolution and possibly an observed initial state could provide better regional climate change information for decision support and other applications over the next few decades. An Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) session in the summer of 2006 first proposed an experimental design for the next round of coordinated climate change experiments that explicitly included short-term climate predictions to be performed for assessment by the international climate modeling community. Since then this has been taken up by World Climate Research program (WCRP), International Geosphere/Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the IPCC, with the WCRP's Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) targeting decadal prediction as the next big research challenge for the climate modeling community. The AGCI session in 2008 takes up where the 2006 session left off, and carries this concept to the next level by tackling not only the formidable science issues involved with designing and running short term climate projections (now more commonly referred to as  decadal prediction ).  The session also addresses the important issues of the utility and application of this information for decision support and impacts research.  The organizers invited U.S. and international experts from modeling groups doing research in decadal prediction, as well as representatives from the decision support and impacts communities who would use this information.  Output from this session will be a white paper summarizing the current state of knowledge on decadal prediction, the degree of success one could expect from such experiments, possible solutions to the scientific challenges involved with this problem, and an assessment of how this type of climate change information could be used for decision support and impacts analyses the next few decades.

       " 'Much of the literature on technological innovation focuses on analyzing measures of the scientific, technical, or commercial productivity of specific types of innovation-related activities in isolation, and does not consider the overall productivity of the linked sequences of these activities that constitute an innovation chain, from scientific discovery through commercialization. There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects',\n",

As a two-year workshop, the program gives a two-week session during the first year that presents IA theory and practice, and then gives a three-day follow-up session during the second year where participants present their initial outcomes and results to their peers. This method integrates three main components: technological knowledge, pedagogical support and an individual curriculum development plan',\n",
       " \"The research objective of the project is the design of a photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system for remote rural health clinics in Egypt. The work encompasses data collection of load and weather parameters, selection and comparison of PV grid-connected system configurations, modeling and simulation of PV-grid-connected operation, design of power management system, economic assessment of the proposed system and specification of the proposed system.This project is being supported by the U.S.-Egypt Joint Board For Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.  Intellectual Merit:The project represents a natural continuation of the scientific cooperation between the Electronics Research Institute and the University of Nevada in the new research area of photovoltaic (PV) energy as an alternative and clean energy source. The project will focus on a detailed study of PV-grid connected energy system configuration, components, mode of operation and control, and costs. The second main objective of the project is to study the utilization of PV grid-connected energy systems to supply remote rural emergency health clinics in Egypt with electrical energy. This includes assessing the required size of the PV system. Broader Impacts:The project's objectives are to develop new approaches to energy systems that will provide reliable service to remote hospitals in Egypt where grid power is currently unreliable. Moreover, the approach to PV grid-connected energy systems will encourage government and private investment in PV energy in Egypt. This will provide currently underserved areas with access to reliable clean energy while saving fossil fuels and protecting the environment from harmful emissions. In addition, some of the developed solutions will benefit states with remote sparsely populated areas, like Nevada. As part of the effort young Egyptian scientists will be trained in the use of sophisticated software for power system analysis that is not available in their institutions\",\n",

With support from the National Science Foundation, Julie McIntosh (Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California) and her team will document the nearly extinct Northwestern Maidu language (also called Konkow or Concow Maidu).  It is now believed to have no more than four fluent speakers, and thus the urgency of the documentation effort is great. Although other Maiduan languages, particularly Northeastern (Mountain) Maidu, have received scholarly attention, Northwestern Maidu has so far been the subject of only limited study, and virtually none within the past forty years. The project will make video and audio recording of the speech of the remaining speakers; transcribe selected recordings; create a lexical database from both earlier sources and current speakers, and create an inventory of all extant written and electronic materials relating to the language. All language documentation materials will be prepared in a variety of paper, analog, and digital formats to make them maximally available both to the local indigenous communities and to researchers. With the silencing of hundreds of languages in the past decades, it has never been clearer that every human language represents a unique intellectual achievement, and that the loss of any language is a loss of knowledge that has repercussions far beyond the local community. The documentation of the Concow Maidu language will set the foundation for integrated research activities for the Maidu community, as well as for linguists. These first steps in documentation will prepare the way for the creation of a variety of resources to be used in language revitalization, both pedagogical materials and a grammar',\n",

       " 'Introduction: This proposal is prepared in response to the devastating floods in Eastern Iowa and nearlythe entire Upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin during May-July 2008. In UMR Pool 16, above Lock andDam 16 at Muscatine, Iowa, waters abruptly rose from a highly managed stage of approximately 10 feetto 20 feet and then to nearly 24 feet from May-June 2008. This historic flood event coincided withintense spring cultivation and nutrient application activities in the heavily farmed landscape of theUpper Midwest resulting in a significant pulse of agricultural contaminants to the UMR system. This hasled scientists to predict an almost unprecedented delivery of sediment and nutrients to Pool 16, thebroader Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.This event presents a unique, and short-lived, opportunity to test scientific hypotheses related to ahighly perturbed, large river ecosystem. This ecosystem of braided channels and natural backwaters isalready known to inadequately process nutrients such as nitrate to the degree required to protect theGulf from hypoxic episodes. Extreme, flood-related sediment deposition almost certainly impacts thenutrient processing cycle in the short and long term. It is also known that mussels and bacteria play amajor role in nutrient cycling in the broad food web containing phytoplankton, zooplankton, microzooplankton,dissolved & particulate organic matter, and benthos. Given this confluence of events, andthe importance of understanding nutrient cycling, we wish to test the following hypothesis:Intense deposition of particulate organic matter from extreme flooding alters the freshwater mussel andmicrobial food webs through physical and chemical means.Immediate Need: The principal investigators feel this hypothesis can only be tested via the quickresponseSmall Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) funding mechanism since the highly perturbedecosystem in question is actively returning to more steady-state conditions. The research team must bedeployed very soon to study the perturbed nitrogen cycling rates such that comparisons with baselinenitrogen processing rates can be made in the future.Broader Impacts: Floods occur around the world on a regular basis, but the frequency and extremity ofthese events will increase given the influence of global climate change. This research will contribute tothe development of a ?theory of floods? that is proposed by colleagues at the University of Iowa. Thistheory will seek to unify research related to hydrology, ecology, socio-economic, environmental andhuman consequences and influences on flooding. The impact of such research can be expressed inbillions of dollars, millions of acres of habitat, thousands of species, and centuries of human enjoyment.Intellectual Merit: This research will expand our knowledge of large river nutrient processing dynamicsresulting from extreme flooding events and during baseline moments. Abrupt changes in nutrientloading and extreme shifts in algal compositions can influence food quality which may adversely affectdesirable and invasive freshwater mussels. This work will further characterize the relation betweennutrient conditions and food quality for mussels and other biota in an important reach of the UpperMississippi River. Water quality, nutrients, and their effects of biological processes are key managementconcerns in the Upper Mississippi River',\n",

       " 'Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  The work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming HIT and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems',\n",

       " 'Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement award seeks to improve observational modeling and analysis of high elevation hydroclimatology by strengthening the instrumentation and modeling infrastructure. A second goal is to address a critical state problem with global significance ? understanding and forecasting the effects of climate change on water supply and water quality in arid regions. Climate changes are affecting natural environments around the world. In New Mexico, climate changes are altering processes associated with water supply, which sustains New Mexico?s economy and determines, to a large extent, the quality of life. This multidisciplinary effort will transform climate change science and policymaking in New Mexico by providing the tools required for quantitative, science-driven discussion of difficult water policy options facing the state, and will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources.Project Major Foci: The research will address the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations on regional and local atmospheric processes and explore how hydrometeorological fluctuations propagate into changes in surface flows downstream.Given the uncertainties associated with global coupled model projections across southwestern North America, the research will examine the covariability of precipitation and land anomalies in these projections as they relate to the Southwest. Land-atmosphere feedbacks associated with snowpack at high elevation may be of first-order importance in modulating the transition from winter to summer precipitation in the current climate. Thus, characterizing and properly simulating the full seasonal hydrological cycle in regions with winter snowpack is critical for process-based analysis and for projections of stream flows in New Mexico, motivating the proposal?s focus on the upstream portion of the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico.Intellectual MeritThe impacts of climate change on New Mexico are profound and are altering processes associated with the water supply for the region. Proposed research infrastructure improvements will enable scientists to observe processes at the watershed scale and to understand the effects of climate change on water supply, water sources, and water quality in arid regions. New Mexico EPSCoR proposes to strategically invest in building a robust hydrologic infrastructure to develop a better understanding of the relationship of high elevation events to downstream water supplies. This capability is needed for meaningful forecasting and decision support. New cyberinfrastructure will support multi-scale modeling and rapid delivery of climate change data and information to scientists, educators, decision-makers, and the public.Broader ImpactsNew Mexico EPSCoR research foci are of global scientific and societal importance. The investment in research, cyberinfrastructure and human infrastructure will establish New Mexico as a laboratory for climate change and a model for science-based public policy that can serve science and society. Education, outreach and diversity programs will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources',\n",
       " \"Many neurons in the auditory system respond to sounds nonlinearly; that is, its response to two sounds played simultaneously differs from the sum of its responses to each sound played alone. Nonlinearities are necessary for many computational functions, but unlike nonlinear models that allow closed-form solutions, nonlinear models are often too hard to characterize in practice. To make nonlinear models tractable, this project will combine single-unit recording in awake marmoset monkey with automated online stimulus design by parallel computing. The goal of this stimulus design is not to maximize the firing rate of a neuron, but to extract the most information about the global stimulus-response relationship.  Optimal sounds will be designed  on the fly  according to a neuron's response history, with the help of a fast parallel computer whose running time is compatible with the single-unit recording experiment. The proposed research is expected to produce practical and widely applicable methods for characterizing nonlinear sensory neurons. The auditory system is an ideal system for this type of online experiment because sound space is of lower dimensions and allows faster computations. The methods developed here are expected to generalize to nonlinear problems in other sensory modalities.Theory and algorithm development will focus on generating sound stimuli which can either most accurately estimate a given model, or maximally distinguish competing models. Nonlinear models with various degrees of complexity, including neural network models, will be used simultaneously, and contrasted against one another in the automated experiment. The model-based sound design method will be used to characterize complex response properties of neurons in auditory cortex and inferior colliculus of awake marmoset monkey, a vocal primate. This project focuses on the auditory cortex because studies of its pronounced nonlinearities may potentially benefit most from the new method. For comparison the same method will also be applied to the inferior colliculus, the inputs to which are better known, allowing more realistic hierarchical models to be developed. The models obtained from this method should provide a concise summary of the global stimulus-response relationship of a neuron that generalizes across all types of stimuli. Neural network models may also help extract additional information about the connectivity between different neuronal types, thus providing a link between the stimulus-response function and the structure of the underlying neural circuits\",\n",
       " \"On an ordinary day, people perform actions that affect other people's behavior resulting in outcomes that affect both.  Such social interactions are dynamic, far ranging, and usually require an exchange of information between the parties involved. A simple example is two persons modifying their approach to an elevator to accommodate each other's passage through the narrow space. More complex situations involve a teacher providing guidance to a pupil based on the pupil's own actions or training foreign military personnel to accomplish some function that depends on the latter's previous experiences. How are such social interactions to be quantified and understood? What goes on in a person's brain when they interact with another and what principles and mechanisms govern the coordination between brains?  The investigators of this project constitute an interdisciplinary team whose expertise spans physics, cognitive science and neuroscience. They use the concepts, methods and tools of coordination dynamics, the science of coordination, to investigate both the behavioral and neural underpinnings of social behavioral interactions. The basic experimental paradigm involves coordination of movements between two people or between an individual and a computer avatar endowed with human-like capabilities. Pairs of people perform simple actions in front of each other and the investigators monitor key behavioral and neural variables that reveal how strongly each affects the other. By testing specific predictions of a mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, the investigators aim to understand how social coordination evolves in time and to determine the respective strength of one person's influence on another. Modern technology is always seeking to enhance human experience and productivity. The notion of 'others' has been expanded to include not only real human beings but also cyber-individuals, as evident in the increasing roles played by robotics and virtual environments in everyday human transactions.  In crucial experiments, a human subject interacts with a virtual partner, an avatar driven by the investigators' mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, thereby allowing the investigators to manipulate parameters (the 'personality' or 'attitude' of the virtual partner) that are not normally accessible in studies of live interactions. Thus the present project may not only uncover rules of ordinary social coordination but also offer a principled approach to human-machine interaction. In addition, the project will disseminate knowledge about complex systems and dynamical approaches to human social behavior. The investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced methods and analysis techniques that cut across the behavioral and social sciences, the physics and mathematics of coupled dynamical systems, and neuroscience and brain imaging. The development of new measuring instruments that may apply to any arbitrary social interaction is a target. Such training aims to bring forth a new generation of interdisciplinary scientist who will be equipped to integrate studies of brain, behavior and social function within a much needed dynamical framework\",\n",
       " \"This project will address the development of catalysts for the stereoselective formation of C-C bonds using nitroalkanes.  The ease of deprotonation adjacent to nitroalkanes along with their facile conversion to other functionality such as amines and ketones makes them attractive targets for reaction control.  Organocatalysts have been developed that achieve asymmetric conjugate addition of nitroalkanes with a variety of substrates, presumably through non-covalent stabilization of the anionic intermediates.  Catalyst design continues through investigation of additional scaffolds that are complementary to nitroalkane structure as well as expanding the scope of applicable nitroalkanes. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Linton of the Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College.  Professor Linton's research efforts revolve around the development of molecular catalysts that control the reactions of nitroalkanes.  Since stereoselective syntheses are required for numerous pharmaceutical and biological substrates, these catalysts have broad applicability to a wide variety of relevant target molecules.  Additionally this approach uses environmentally friendly organocatalysts that can perform these reactions with minimal use of reagents and minimal production of waste\",\n",

Balint-Kurti, North Carolina State UniversityPlant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that respond to pathogen invasion by triggering a rapid, localized  hypersensitive reaction  (HR), in which host tissue immediately adjacent to the site of infection undergoes programmed cell death. Although, HR is a fundamental part of the immune response in plants, very little is known about the genes that trigger, signal, execute, and then contain it. Exhaustive mutagenesis screens have been conducted in Arabidopsis, but have turned up only a few genes linked to HR, possibly because of genetic redundancy or lethality of HR mutants. An alternate and potentially huge resource of HR variation is available in natural germplasm.  If effectively tapped and delineated, this resource has the potential to advance considerably our understanding of HR . By taking advantage of a constitutive-active allele of the Rp1 gene, which confers resistance to the common rust disease of maize, we have demonstrated that the maize germplasm contains vast amounts of variation capable of impacting HR. This project will test the broad use of an innovative approach, which looks for naturally occurring alleles that suppress mutant phenotypes to rapidly detect and explore natural variation underlying HR. Using this approach, one HR-modulating locus (Hrml1) has already been identified and mapped in a preliminary test using the IBM population of maize; this QTL will be cloned.  In addition, many more QTL will be identified and characterized by broadening the screen to the 5000-line Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population currently available to the maize community. The broader impacts of the project are many-fold.  First, the approach of discovering and harnessing genetic diversity is likely to be broadly applicable to a large number of important traits in most plant species. Second, an outreach component will bring the uses of biodiversity to middle school curricula (Grades 6-8) and the topics of DNA sequence analysis and quantitative trait analysis to high school curricula, with the development and test of teaching materials that can be widely distributed.  Third, these teaching modules will be developed for and with students from a wide range of cultural, racial and educational backgrounds, and their teachers.  This approach will allow development of several versions of these modules, using different examples, different assessments and different forms of presentation so that they can be applied  effectively in a variety of settings.  The goal is to overturn the stereotype that these subjects are too complex for middle and high school students to grasp, and to prime student to investigate plant diversity and genetics in greater detail later in their education so that they are better able to understand the issues.  These topics are not generally covered in most science curricula at these levels, despite their increasing importance scientifically and socially.

Due to long use, the system is currently in need of repair for corrosion damage, recalibration and upgrades to provide data logging and modern sensor capabilities. The upgraded system will allow research on soil hydrogeologic processes in arid environments which comprise a considerable area of the US southwest. The facility will be used to study the coupled ecosystem and soil hydrological processes - at the mesoscale. The sustainability of water resources in arid environments will be evaluated in collaboration with researchers at the Desert Research Institute (DRI). Vegetation and hydrologic responses to varying precipitation patters will be evaluated in different desert environments (e.g. Majove vs. Sonoran desert). The facility will interface with large-scale studies at the University of Arizona?s Biosphere 2 which will be instrumental in predicting landscape processes. The upgrade will consist of repairs, instrumenting real-time lysimeter data streams, producing a web resource which will create an Instructional Environmental Observatory (IEO), and create a foundation for collaborative research on coupled soil hydrological and ecosystem processes in arid environments. Funding will be shared with PIs' startup monies. A part-time technician will be provided by the Department of Soil, Water & Environmental Science. Water issues in the desert southwest carry tremendous societal impacts. Pumping rates in arid regions vastly exceed recharge rates for sensitive aquifers.

       " 'Humans have an amazing facility in switching attention between two or more ongoing tasks. This kind of cognitive flexibility allows for successful navigation of the demands of everyday life, but it declines with aging. Recent results have shown that such age-related declines are not as severe in lifelong bilinguals; speaking more than one language on a regular basis since childhood seems to provide some protection from this general effect. Current cognitive models suggest that the basis of this boost relates to the fact that bilinguals are constantly switching between multiple languages, which serves to strengthen task switching and related executive control processes. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Brian Gold and his colleagues at the University of Kentucky will conduct experiments designed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological bases of bilingual advantages in executive control processes. The methods used will include standard behavioral experiments and neuroimaging studies conducted with monolingual and bilingual participants. In behavioral studies, participants will engage in task switching and working memory paradigms and reaction time and accuracy data will be recorded. Results will explore whether bilingualism strengthens just those processes that directly replicate the bilingual experience, or if it serves to bolster other executive control processes, such as memory updating. The neuroimaging studies will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods to understand the neurobiological bases of bilingual performance advantages. The fMRI experiment will identify variations in bilingual brain activation patterns that correlate with their advantages on executive control tasks. The DTI measures will identify variations in white matter microstructure in bilinguals, ones that correlate with the advantages on executive control tasks. The experiments will provide a more precise understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological variables that seem to be protected by lifelong bilingualism. Results from the present project will be relevant to the question of how accessible lifestyle variables can influence neuroplasticity and/or compensatory brain reserve in aging. It will also provide research training and mentoring to a postdoctoral fellow and two undergraduate research assistants. Trainees will acquire knowledge in neuroanatomy, and the analysis of neuroimaging data. This project will provide information about the relationship between second language learning and neurobiology, an issue of fundamental relevance in our increasingly multilingual society',\n",

Over the last decade these effects have increasingly been recognized to be important in ocean systems. Identifying sites and times where these metals cause negative environmental outcomes is greatly hampered by their comparatively sparse datasets.

The project, therefore, has three goals: (1) to characterize cyber-enabled learning using a case study; (2) to identify the assessment and psychometric issues related to assessing cyber-enabled learning; and (3) to propose methodological solutions to modeling learning in such complex learning environments. The focus of the stduy is on a substantial case study in geoscience, which employs science content that is accessible to a wide range of the education community, and which draws on known areas of research, particularly scientific visualization: the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and related phenomena. This project asks: What is the character of analytical reasoning for geoscience within a networked, cyber-infrastructure framework, and what counts as evidence for such reasoning? What assessment and psychometric issues must be addressed? What are the methodological challenges in modeling and assessing learning within this cyber-infrastructure project?

       " \"The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles.

Increased understanding of STEM concepts helps remove the fear factor and allows students to achieve a comfort level characterized by curiosity and creativity in these areas, inspiring them to continue to pursue STEM projects and classes and make relevant connections between STEM concepts and the analysis and solution of real world problems. Teachers will become an integral part of a dynamic, supportive network of college faculty and business and industry partners that will provide sustained support and be responsive to the changing needs of both teachers and students\",\n",

       " \"This award supports research and education on emergent properties of highly correlated electronic systems. The main thrust of the research undertaken here is the effort at  theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e. new states of matter) as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In addition, some of the research explores qualitatively the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work is based on an analogy between classical liquid crystals and corresponding phases of strongly interacting electrons.  Electronic liquid crystals are quantum states with behaviors intermediate between a Fermi liquid and a Wigner crystal. Examples of such states have recently been observed experimentally: the anisotropic states (quantum Hall nematics) that are seen in high mobility quantum Hall devices and the metamagnetic nematic phase that has recently been identified in Sr3Ru2O7. The more microscopic issues to be addressed involve the physics of the superconducting Tc. A number of questions are addressed theoretically.  What is it about superconductivity that causes transition temperatures, generally, to be so low, while other orders, such as ferromagnetism, frequently onset at much higher temperatures? Why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which Tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? Are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? The research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. The research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. The broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. This research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.The  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. The questions are quite basic.  What is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low? Why is there, in some high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' composition at which the working temperature is highest? Are there optimal ways of creating structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance performance? The research is motivated by a need to clarify which experimental  observations are complicating details and which are essential clue to discovering to the mechanism needed to explain high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences.

       " 'The Alboran Sea was created in the wake of the young subduction zones that swept across the Western Mediterranean in the Neogene during the convergence of Africa and Europe.  The Gibraltar Arc and Alboran Sea are the westernmost part of the system and one of the most confusing.  The mixture of westward rollback, extension, strike-slip, volcanism, uplift and subsidence has defied attempts to compose a consistent scenario that explains all of the obervations.  Partly as a result of inadequate data, there are many models that have been proposed involving subduction, slab breakoff, delamination and drips.  There is credible evidence that the lithospheric mantle of the overriding plate of a west-facing subduction zone has been thinned by both back-arc stretching and some type of convective removal (e.g. drips, delamination, etc.).  The process of convective thinning is poorly understood but is believed to be important in driving uplift and subsidence of the Earth?s surface, influencing rates of deformation in active orogens, and contributing to recycling of continental materials back into the mantle.  This award provides for a multidisciplinary, international investigation of the Alboran Sea, Gibraltar arc, Atlas Mountains and surrounding areas in the western Mediterranean using passive and active seismology, magnetotellurics, geochemistry, petrology/structural geology, and geodynamic modeling.  The overall goal of the project is to study the processes responsible for convective thinning in the Gibraltar-Alboran Sea region.  The project, known as PICASSO, has now been funded in Spain and Ireland as a colloaborative EU-US program, with proposals from a number of other EU nations submitted or in process.  The project was selected as the pilot experiment for TopoEurope, an EarthScope-like initiative recently approved by the European Science Foundation.  A large part of the field deployments will be done by European scientists, including a 3D EarthScope-type rolling array (IberArray), with additional targeted field experiments by US investigators.  The IberArray is already underway with ~60 stations deployed in the PICASSO field area',\n",
       " 'An award has been made to Dr. Gregory Buck of Virginia Commonwealth University for a study of genomic diversity and evolution in the Euglenozoa, a diverse group of microscopic unicellular protists..  The group includes model organisms as well as important human parasites.  The evolutionary relationships of these poorly studied unicellular organisms are not well understood. Euglenozoa are micro-organisms of enormous significance to the environment, the economy, and to public health. One group, the trypanosomatids, which are responsible for human and agricultural diseases, have been extensively studied. However, other members of the phylum have only been loosely characterized, and their taxonomic relationships are very poorly defined.  In this project, the genomes of five exemplar species will be examined in detail, and a smaller set of genes from each of several hundred strategically selected species of Euglenozoa will be also examined and compared for a broad study of the group. The goal is to use state-of-the-art gene sequencing technologies to elucidate the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships of group. Novel strategies of computational biology will be applied to develop new insights into how the diverse feeding and life history traits of these organisms have evolved. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral trainees at Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Georgia, and Michigan State University.  Students will be recruited for a summer program in bioinformatics and bioengineering to conduct independent research related to this project.  High school teachers and students from underrepresented groups will also participate in the program.  Three of the senior research personnel on the project are Hispanic.  The research on Euglenozoa will be incorporated into several summer workshop programs for high school students, as well as a graduate level course in evolutionary biology',\n",
       " 'CBET-0828655BarthelmieOptimal spacing of wind turbines in large wind farm arrays depends in part on turbine interactions, i.e. wind turbine wakes that are maximized at close spacing. Wakes are the volume downwind of individual turbines where wind speed is reduced and turbulence is enhanced due to energy extraction at the preceding turbine. In large offshore wind farms, power losses due to wakes can exceed 20% of total potential power production and lead to an increase in fatigue loading reducing turbine lifetimes. The objective of the research is to quantify and improve predictive capability for the development, propagation, combination and dissipation of wind turbine wakes in large onshore wind farms.  Wake models used in current wind farm prediction tools under-predict power losses in large wind farms. There are two potential explanations; (1) large wind farms create additional turbulence which fundamentally alters the structure of the overlying boundary-layer, (2) combining wakes from individual turbines both downwind and laterally is mis-specified by the current generation of wind farm models. Evaluation of the models in small wind farms (three rows or smaller) indicates that models are able to capture power losses due to wakes which lends support to these two hypotheses that pertain to large multi-row arrays. This project will combine statistical analysis of observed wind farm data with evaluation and development of three classes of models (from the analytic to computational fluid dynamics codes) to improve predictions of wake losses. The goal is to produce a model that accurately captures wake propagation and interactions in different wind speed, turbulence and atmospheric stability conditions, to model wake combination in a more realistic way and to account for changes in the structure of the boundary-layer. Ultimately, this will produce a model which accurately quantifies wake losses for existing wind farm layouts and will allow assessment of wind farm layouts (turbine spacing) which are optimized for wake losses.  The outcome from this project will contribute unique insight into how wakes propagate through large wind farms, and transform the ways in which wake impacts on power output are modeled.This project will be led by Professor R.J. Barthelmie, a renowned leader in wind energy research, and will be conducted in collaboration with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Airtricity/E.ON, a world leading renewable energy company. Both have agreed to provide data from operating large wind farms and to collaboration on model application and evaluation. This collaboration will both enhance the project and increase symbioses and knowledge transfer. The project will also enhance educational and training opportunities at Indiana University',\n",

       " 'Collaborative Research: Project IBORC: Interaction between Building and Occupant Responses during CollapseAbstractThe primary objective of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary investigation ? at the intersection of structural engineering, social science, and computer science ? of how building occupants respond to signals issued by a building during and immediately after a compromising event that threatens its integrity. Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research. The project will furthermore contribute to the state-of-the-art in hazards research by developing knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help building occupants, their rescuers and city officials respond appropriately during extreme events',\n",
       " 'Evaporation from the soil largely determines both water availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and the partitioning of solar radiation between sensible and latent heat. It is key to both hydrology and climate. The evaporation process is complex, involving movement and phase change of water, varying with depth and time. Following water inputs, evaporation occurs at the soil surface, controlled by atmospheric demand. As surface soil water is depleted, evaporation becomes soil-limited and shifts below the surface; nonetheless it is generally viewed as a strictly surface process. As a result, measurement methods and understanding of these near-surface phenomena have lagged behind demand for accurate data. Much current research emphasizes large-scale areal estimates of soil moisture and temperature, but poor understanding of the soil water evaporation process causes low accuracy in water and energy balances. This poor understanding is largely due to our current inability to make the needed measurements.The purpose of the proposed research is to develop and test a new approach to measure evaporation within the soil. Recently developed sensors and concepts enable us to quantify sensible heat transferred into and out of mm-scale near-surface soil layers, as well as the change in sensible heat stored within each layer. Combined with conservation of energy, these measurements can locally quantify subsurface evaporation, showing the temporal patterns of in situ evaporation. Research will test four hypotheses: (1) that a sensible heat balance method can accurately estimate the mass of water evaporated from subsurface soil layers, (2) that the heat balance method can be extended to determine the latent heat flux from the soil surface layer (0-3 mm), (3) that through combined heat and mass balance, estimates of other hydrological components (transpiration and soil water flow) will be quantified or constrained, and (4) that the sensible heat balance method can quantitatively partition ET into evaporation and transpiration. Hypotheses 1-3 will be tested with both laboratory and field experiments, and Hypothesis 4 only by field experiments. Laboratory experiments will measure soil thermal properties, water content, and water flux under a combination of 2 energy regimes, 3 surface conditions, and 3 soils. Calculated evaporative loss via heat balance will be compared to evaporation measured by mass balance. In the field experiments, independent measurements of evaporation and transpiration will allow rigorous testing of heat balance estimates of transpiration and soil water evaporation.The intellectual merit of the proposed work is a new measurement-based methodology for quantifying soil water evaporation. The proposed research addresses current knowledge gaps by developing and testing in situ soil water evaporation measurement with novel sensors and analysis. Information obtained in the study will elucidate important evaporative processes. The research will quantify observation of soil water evaporation at and below the soil surface. This represents a notable advancement over descriptions of evaporation as a surface-only process.The proposed work carries broader impact by providing educational, scientific, and societal opportunities. Fundamental experience is provided for an early-career scientist, graduate students (including a minority student who is a NSF AGEP Fellow), and undergraduates. Results will be widely disseminated to the scientific community via website and published articles, and measurement techniques will have immediate repercussions for weather, climate, and environmental monitoring. Achieving the project goals will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental critical-zone properties and processes, enable better environmental monitoring and management, and enhance our predictions of large-scale hydrological and climate dynamics',\n",
       " 'SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots',\n",
       " \"The  Mathematics Teacher Transformation Institutes  (MTTI) project is a research-based investigation of how leadership emerges and is expressed through mathematics knowledge, student-focused instructional practices, and influences on schools' mathematics outcomes.  In particular, this research is broadening the knowledge base on teaching and learning in mathematics through new understanding of how the study of conceptually-challenging mathematics, particularly in algebra and geometry, benefits second-stage teachers (4-10 years' experience); of how classroom-based action research contributes to critical and analytical understanding of the relationships between teaching practices and student learning; and of how multi-levels of support prepare second-stage teachers for leadership roles. To achieve these research objectives, the City University of New York (CUNY), Herbert H. Lehman College is partnering with New York City Department of Education Districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Lehman College faculty in mathematics and mathematics education, staff of education centers and institutes who work in Bronx schools, and the Superintendents of Bronx districts work together to engage 80 experienced middle or high school teachers in the Bronx in 330 hours of professional development over 3 years to strengthen their leadership abilities, mathematics abilities, and educational practices.  These MTTI teacher participants are further supported on-site at their schools and through on-line discussion forums and are provided opportunities to showcase their work.  MTTI cultivates a professional network of mathematics teacher leaders who provide leadership to 200 additional middle and high school mathematics teachers as they enact a variety of roles including mentor, peer coach, presenter, conference participant/speaker, and active member of school curriculum and professional development teams.  Additionally, they participate in local and national discussions of current policy, practice, and research, and they develop informed understandings of the strengths and challenges of culturally and linguistically diverse classes.

Drawing on three well-documented frameworks, Culturally Relevant Pedagogical practices (CRP), Social Justice Youth Development Framework, and Future Time Perspective, this after-school and summer program fosters in IT/STEM related outcomes for 100 adolescent (grades 8-12) girls from several Phoenix high needs districts and schools. COMPUGIRLS takes place at two sites, ASU and the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton. Already, 40 girls have completed one-year of the program. This project expands the program to include another 60 students, their parents, ASU graduate students and in-service teachers, and peer mentors. COMPUGIRLS provides hands-on technology experiences that include internships, Advanced Placement credit, conference and community presentations, and parent workshops that will ultimately develop participants' techno-social analytic skills for real world problems.As part of their experience, students visit ASU. For many, this is the first time they have been on a college campus. Students participate in 6 multimedia courses: 1) social justice and the media, 2) SCRATCH, user-friendly computer programming, 3) modding SIMS, designing, modifying, and troubleshooting simplified simulations, 4) choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, 5) advanced choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, and 6) teamwork to create neighborhoods in Sim City using all skills learned. Participants' projects will be disseminated semi-annually through community ceremonies, web pages, and presentations.The project builds upon a pilot program (Summer 2007 to present) that accommodated 40 girls from under-resourced districts in the Phoenix metro area. The COMPUGIRLS program is a two-year curriculum using multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking. The project advances understanding of how to encourage girls (including girls from underrepresented groups) to pursue ICT fields. It builds upon established research and includes evaluation of the impact on participants' computational thinking, techno-social analytical skills, attitudes about and interest in pursuing further education and careers in ICT/STEM fields. The goals are:1) To use multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking; 2) To enhance girls' techno-social analytical skills; and 3) To provide the building blocks for Arizona girls from underrepresented groups to successfully traverse an ICT and/or any work force roadmap. The evaluation of the project consists of a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative), incorporating the use of survey instruments, student journals, focus groups, interviews, document review, observation and an intensive case study. A comparison/control group is incorporated into the pre- and post-test design to determine the extent the participants' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors changed relative to where they would have been without participation in the project\",\n",
       " 'In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program',\n",
       " 'Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D.This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty.The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models',\n",
       " 'CBET-0838607DozierThe WATERS Network is an initiative to transform science and engineering of the water environment.  The goal is to create a national capability to better predict and manage the behavior of water-and its nutrients, contaminants, and sediments-everywhere in the U.S.  Population growth, evolving land use, and climate change make the future water environment uncertain, so prediction and management require understanding along with statistical relationships, and thereby require integration among people who study how water moves and transforms landscapes; who manage and treat water to ensure potable supplies and prevent floods; and who consider how humans, institutions, and managed systems respond to and superimpose variability on quality, scarcity, or hazard. Driving the requirement for an integrated, collaboratively developed infrastructure is the recognition that we have to predict and manage water nationwide.  Predicting Water Quality and Quantity Everywhere at All Times (WQ2EAT) requires a judicious integration of models and syn-thesis, cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach, existing networks, and remotely sensed data, along with new measurements, analyses, and experiments at a realistic number of carefully chosen sites or basins.  A network of observational and experimental facilities, where processes are studied and manipulated, will provide knowledge that can be transferred to any location on the continent.  The proposed network spans the domain of water environments-pristine, rural, and urban areas and constructed networks and facilities for management and treatment.  The capacity for prediction ranges from episodic events such as floods and storm-water overflows, through seasonal spring runoff and surges of agricultural wastes, to multi-decadal projections.The task of the investigation is to create a prototype network design that will enable detailed specification and budgeting to prepare for a conceptual design review.  The investigation will analyze existing sources of data across a domain representing the extant human-influenced water environment, conduct modeling exercises to identify new measurement needs and predict in locations where we lack intensive measurements, and scrutinize emerging technologies and different variables to observe at different scales.  Alternative observational designs, as well as experimental facilities and campaigns, will be evaluated according to their capability to support key scientific objectives. The WATERS Network will help us understand and predict the ways in which heterogeneous processes interact with one another at different scales to produce the variability found in the water environment.  Knowledge about explicitly scale-dependent processes will thereby inform options for management and engineering design. Water for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial processes is perhaps humanitys most fundamental need.  Our traditional methods of predicting and managing water and its quality are based on statistical relations developed when human impacts were isolated and climate was relatively stable.  These boundary conditions are changing, hence the need for new fundamental understanding.  The WATERS Network focuses on the U.S., but the knowledge gained and the technologies developed will apply globally',\n",

The project uses Earth Systems Science(ESS)content and inquiry-based instructional practices to emphasize themes that unite all sciences and mathematics. MITEP includes both summer and academic-year components, and uses a variety of on-site, residential, field, distance, and in-service delivery methods. Components promote leadership skills, collaboration, urban place-based inquiry, access to cutting-edge data and materials, technology, engagement of diverse learners, study of key scientific concepts that cross disciplinary boundaries, pedagogical innovation. The project will also implement and test lessons and units that challenge students and prepare them for further science study. Teachers receive stipends and credit as incentive for participating in the project and testing its approach to reform.    The project is based on the premise that successful reform depends on the full involvement of teachers who have the skills to lead their colleagues through the process of developing and implementing new instructional approaches. MITEP teacher-leaders and research university faculty are full partners in the process. Teacher-leaders are at the forefront of their schools' and district's efforts to evaluate, design, implement, and test new inquiry-based instructional programs. MITEP teacher-leaders help develop common pacing schedules and  course assessments. They assist with planning  professional development activities and providing ongoing assistance to colleagues. MITEP teacher-leaders are encouraged to disseminate information about the project through presentations at state and national conferences, to submit papers for publication.     Teacher-led reform is strongly supported by the administration of the core school district partner as an innovative way to generate enthusiasm for curricular and instructional change. To encourage development of leadership skills, school administrators give teacher-leaders progressively increased responsibility for strengthening curriculum, improving instructional strategies, and designing assessments. District administrators are providing the resources required for teachers' success in implementing and coordinating the project by assisting with the selection of teachers with exceptional leadership qualities for participation in MITEP;assisting in the design of professional development activities that meet the needs of teachers and their students; providing flexibility in teachers' schedules; utilizing middle-grade teachers' expertise in the dissemination of information to primary and high-school teachers; recognizing, rewarding, and encouraging teachers who serve as leaders; fostering growth of a teacher network; and creating a district-wide atmosphere that nurtures teacher-led reform efforts\",\n",

(MSP)2 proposes to establish a strong, multifaceted partnership among the essential P-16 players in one of the largest minority-majority counties in the country, Prince George's County, Maryland, in order to expand the minority student pipeline in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education.  (MSP)2 will employ four strategies engaging STEM faculty, teachers, undergraduates, and high school students: 1.  Working with approximately 750 teachers in grades 4-8 over five years,     science faculty will develop two different types of professional     development programs designed around principles of teaching and learning     through inquiry science. 2.  A total of 110 high school science teachers will engage in summer research    experiences over five years with college and university STEM faculty. 3.  At least 375 high school students over five years will be offered     opportunities to take challenging science courses through an innovative     early college/dual enrollment programs. 4.  100 undergraduate underrepresented minority college undergraduate students    will be offered opportunities for teaching experiences (with 100 PGCPS     science teachers to mentor them) and 50 undergraduate will be offered     research experiences over 5 years. (MSP)2 will explore four research strands through four implementation strategies:  (1) In what ways do different inquiry-based professional development experiences and training for elementary and middle school teachers influence students'interest in science? Are different models more effective at achieving different outcomes? How do these possible effects compare for underrepresented minority students and teachers versus non-minority?  (2) What characteristics of summer research opportunities for secondary science teachers, paired with intentional learning communities focused on the nature of scientific inquiry, lead to enhanced curriculum and greater success for students in science, particularly underrepresented minorities?  (3) In what ways do opportunities for secondary students to take early-college and dual-enrollment courses affect the likelihood that students, particularly underrepresented minorities, will attend college and choose science majors? And (4) How do opportunities for undergraduate science majors to teach science lessons in elementary and secondary schools affect the likelihood that science majors will consider a career in teaching? How do early research experiences affect the likelihood that STEM majors will complete science degrees\",\n",

       " \"The earliest detailed records of Australia's indigenous languages date from approximately two hundred years ago, and therefore our only access to the prehistory of Australia's indigenous past is through reconstruction in archeology and linguistics. While we know that humans have lived in Australia for more than 40,000 years, we do not know how speakers of the 250 currently attested languages came to live where they do today. This project uses linguistic evidence to trace the history of Aboriginal people in prehistoric times. Systematic similarities between words in these languages can be used to reconstruct various properties of prehistoric languages. These techniques will be used to determine the structure of the Pama-Nyungan language family, which will shed light on prehistoric population movements.Australia's linguistic prehistory is important for several reasons. It has been claimed that methods developed for Europe and the Americas do not work in Australia. If true, such a finding would be highly important, since these methods are based on properties of language change which until now have been assumed to be universal. However, preliminary work indicates that Australian languages show the same characteristics that we find elsewhere. Small speech community size, widespread multilingualism, and other factors have obscured relationships between these languages. These languages are an excellent laboratory for modeling what language change might have been like before the spread of agricultural communities. If we are ever going to be able to model accurately what prehistoric global language spread might have looked like, we need to understand how it operated in Australia\",\n",
       " 'The number of scientific journals and the number of papers published in those journals is increasing at a fast pace: currently, there are roughly 9,000 scientific journals, a twenty-fold increase from the 400 scientific journals available in 1955. The size and growth of the research literature places a tremendous burden on decision-making agents, such as funding agencies, university administrators, and reviewers, who have to evaluate the quality of research of individuals and institutions in a fast and efficient manner. In addition, the evaluation of individuals and institutions relies heavily on the assessment of the ultimate impact of published research, typically measured as the number of publications or the number of citations. Despite the oversimplification of using just a few numbers to quantify the scientific merit of a body of research, the entire science and technology community is relying more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research performance of individuals and institutions and the development of tools that facilitate the evaluation task is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality standard for funded research.A major challenge is that stakeholders often want an estimate of the impact of a paper long before citations start to accumulate. This project aims precisely at facilitating such a task by developing tools to predict, soon after publication, the ultimate impact of research. This project uses longitudinal data available for papers published since 1955, drawing upon the concept that one can infer patterns of citation accumulation from large-scale analysis of historical data. Broader Impact: The outcome of this research is of relevance to decision makers that are called on to evaluate the productivity of researchers and institutions, as well as the impact of their work. The goal of this project is to develop transparent statistically-sound methods in order to enable institutions and funding agencies to make better informed decisions based on an objective assessment of the impact of published research',\n",
       " 'Scientific communities in cyber-enabled infrastructures are socio-technical innovation systems that exhibit the characteristics of self-organizing complex adaptive systems. Using empirically grounded and conceptually valid agent simulation models of science, the project explores minimal structural and behavioral conditions, that is, the simplest set of assumptions, for the emergence and sustainment of creativity and innovation in Scientific Commons (SCs). The computer-aided ethnography software, called SC Browser, facilitates ethnographic observation of the social and technical networks in communities such as CreativeCommons, Scholarpedia, CollabRX, and OpenWetWare. Inspired by the Actor-Network Theory that focuses on translation networks involving human, symbolic, and physical actors, SC Browser is an advanced analytical tool that aggregates views of interaction among actors and at the same time preserve access to raw research material data sets for qualitative analysis and foundational hypothesis generation to construct computational simulations and to study co-evolution of scientific knowledge, community, and domain practices in the context of systems model of creativity.The simulation study (1) considers the discourse of scientific activity, including the contribution of new knowledge in virtual scientific commons, growth of the domain knowledge, and the clustering of research into specialties, (2) views science as an autonomous and self-regulating socio-cognitive system through the introduction of motivation and competitive nature of knowledge production, and (3) explores the impact of alternative community cultures (e.g., exploration-oriented, service-oriented, and utility-oriented), peer evaluation styles (e.g., centralized, decentralized) on the sustainability and innovation potential of SCs. Besides advancing the socio-technical and cultural understanding of cyber-enabled innovation communities, the project produces an integrated and customizable agent simulation framework, called SciSIM, for science policy mechanism design and decision analysis for virtual scientific communities to improve sustainable innovation.  Using SciSim, the project demonstrates how social networks and market mechanisms provide a sound formal basis to study dynamics of scientific communities using reliable and valid structural and organizational climate metrics.Broader Impacts: The project aims to facilitate training of students to develop computational thinking skills in Science and Technology (S&T) studies. As such, this research is expected to advance the state of the art in S&T curriculum via introduction of computational models as pedagogical instruments. Furthermore, the simulation environment and its associated models can be used by NSF administration for use as a computational laboratory for science policy analysis. Along with the findings of earlier work on Open Source Communities, this project aims to derive of common unifying principles innovation in scientific commons and their documentation via a book on the topic of Sustainable Creativity and Innovation in User Innovation Communities',\n",

       " 'Tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. Energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. Although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. Despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to Holocene and younger deposits. Although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. Within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. The largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms.Carbonate strata within the Proterozoic Atar Group, Mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. The wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the West African craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). Furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. This project, a collaboration between the University of Tennessee Knoxville and Ohio University, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact.This project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two Investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. Both investigators have a long history of public outreach. The University of Tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. These exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers inimplementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern Tennessee',\n",
       " \"Enhanced Science of Science and Innovation Policy depends on better metrics. You can't manage what you can't measure.  This is particularly true for interdisciplinary research, which currently has few generally agreed-upon measures with acceptable degrees of accuracy.  Researchers at the University of Sussex have begun to address this problem by developing a conceptual framework to gauge research diversity.  The current project builds upon that conceptual framework to empirically test metrics that gauge the interdisciplinarity of particular bodies of research.  One proposed key measure assesses the degree to which particular research papers, or collections of such, integrate research knowledge from diverse research domains.  A second measure determines the degree of specialization of collections of research papers (e.g., those published by a particular research center or those of a research area such as quantum dots).  The resulting measures help track and characterize the emergence of new (interdisciplinary) research areas.  The project described in this proposal seeks to generate analytical algorithms for indicators of interdisciplinarity.  It also seeks to visually depict knowledge interchanges among areas of research activity.  Such science maps can help identify and characterize focused areas of research--domains--that are sources of knowledge used by other domains.  They can also show the extent of intellectual and social networking among both domains and contributing institutions.  This project will, through US-UK collaboration, develop effective means to apply and test these new metrics.  The proposed project focuses on nanoscience and nanoengineering ( nano ), an emergent research domain of considerable significance that extends well beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.  Georgia Tech has assembled a substantial nano dataset that will serve as the main testbed for computing and assessing indicator variations.  The research team will generate indicator sets and maps of selected nano sub-topics (e.g., molecular motors research).  These indicator sets and maps will be shared with researchers and R&D managers to gauge their validity and utility. Taking into account feedback, the research team will then develop a taxonomy of nanotechnology research activity based on identification of coherent research sub-areas.Broader Impacts: These tools better enable scientists, science managers, and Federal science and regulatory agencies to gauge and track cross-domain knowledge transfers.  Failure to recognize the full extent and complexity of these patterns could result in major funding and regulatory mistakes.   The new indicators and accompanying maps help identify leverage points likely to spark advances in science, technology, and innovation.  They can also facilitate graduate education by identifying convergent knowledge domains - potentially emerging  interdisciplines.   Better understanding of research landscapes can help orient graduate curricula and spotlight promising dissertation topics.  More accurate interdisciplinarity measures also contribute to an ongoing National Academies initiative to bolster interdisciplinary research across the US\",\n",

       " 'Channel bifurcations, wherein one channel splits into two, are the building blocks of braided, anastomosed, and distributary channel networks. Recent work has shown that the most common flow partitioning at bifurcations is asymmetric, and that this asymmetry seems to promote stability. Why and under what hydrographic and sedimentologic conditions this should be so, remain a puzzle. Here we propose an integrated field and theoretical investigation of the morphology, flow, and sedimentary processes of higher shear-stress, natural river bifurcations, with the objective of understanding and predicting their dynamical behavior. The field studies will be conducted to encompass two bifurcating systems with different sedimentation characteristics: i) distributary channel bifurcations of the Mossy Delta of the Saskatchewan River, where we have conducted pilot studies concerning bifurcation morphodynamics, and ii) bifurcations within the Wax Lake delta system, Louisiana, where active sedimentation is leading to rapid distributary channel growth. Several bifurcations at each site will be chosen to span a range of morphologic types. Bed morphology, water surface topography, flow velocity, and sediment transport rate will be measured at each bifurcation on a closely spaced grid at several flow stages. The field data will provide boundary and initial conditions for numerical experiments designed to define the processes and morphological conditions that lead to inherently unstable bifurcations, and detail the controlling boundary conditions for stability. Earlier numerical models will be improved by using Delft3D-FLOW, a morphodynamic model that accounts for: (1) three-dimensional turbulent unsteady, nonuniform flow, (2) interaction between bed topography, flow, and both bedload and suspended load, and (3) morphodynamically interacting erodible banks and bed. Numerical experiments will allow us to determine the feedback processes that promote stable bifurcations and predict which channel configurations are stable in the face of perturbations. We aim to yield a stability diagram for channel bifurcations and assess the influence of barform dynamics and downstream channel change in influencing bifurcation stability. A better understanding and predictive capability of channel bifurcation behavior would improve flood forecasting, planning and development of floodplain and channel structures, channel designs, and the success of stream restoration efforts. The results of this study also will advance our knowledge of when and where river avulsions will take. Insofar as it is transformative, it will resolve the differences among competing stability theories, and produce a model, constrained by the best-available field data, which can be used to predict the stability and behavior of these ubiquitous hydrologic and geomorphic nodes.Resulting from This Study: This work constitutes the dissertation topic and financial support for one Ph. D. candidate and will support one post-doctoral researcher. Two Native American high school students from the Cumberland House Cree Nation, Saskatchewan will be trained in its scientific methods. All students will benefit from exposure to a problem requiring the integration of geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamic modeling',\n",

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Public Schools, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College have solidified their continued commitment as core partners to this unique collaboration among a large urban district, a four-year urban university, and a two-year technical college. Student achievement has increased in most grade levels with an accompanying decrease in the gap between state and district proficiency. Evaluations indicate that building school capacity through a math framework and distributed leadership via school learning teams and math teacher leaders is associated with improved student achievement.Phase II will investigate three specific research topics. The first topic involves continued study of the impact of distributed leadership through varied mathematics teacher leader models on school professional communities and on student achievement. The MMP initiated a no-release time model of teacher leaders and is transitioning to a partial-release time model with funds from the Office of the Wisconsin Governor. A second area of research is the transition of students to post-secondary mathematics. The MMP will study the impact of a new district post-secondary mathematics readiness exam on high school course enrollments and post-secondary placements into remedial and non-remedial courses.

       " 'The research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. One aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. This especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. Another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). The main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. The solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the Moving Balloon Algebra (MBA) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the Network Algebra (NETALG) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the Moving Object in Network (MONET) Algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. The resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. Examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few.

       " 'The investigators propose to develop and test new instructional techniques aimed at teaching high-school science students how to use the diagrams that appear in their biology textbooks. Research from a range of disciplines has shown that people have difficulty making sense of diagrams. The investigators had previously found that inference and other high-level processes that are important for learning from text are even more important for learning from diagrams. They further showed that students show little gains in content understanding from textbook diagrams. The investigators will capitalize on commonalities among several theories of diagrammatic reasoning to develop four interventions, following an additive design, aimed at improving classroom instruction in how to use diagrams. In each iteration, one additional intervention feature is added to the initial intervention. In the first intervention, they will teach the components of diagrams (i.e., how to read captions, color keys, and other conventions of diagrams). In the second, they will also teach the coordinating of text and diagrams. In the third, they will also have the students engage in self-explanation. In the fourth, they will also have students construct their own drawings.

       " \"The Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC) will focus on research and action on social, psychological, and educational development among African American children and youth.  The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities. The CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents\",\n",

       " 'Government policy today targets firms rather than firm ecosystems.  Given the increased fragmentation of firm activities and increased technological interdependency of these firms over the past 20 years, this mode of policy-making may be outdated.  This research leverages a natural experiment in the converging telecommunications and computing industry to examine the impact on the innovation ecosystem of removing a critical set of innovating firms. Drawing on the results, the researchers seek to define characteristics of innovation ecosystems that could provide resiliency against future shocks.Despite extensive study, there is little agreement within the academic, industrial, or policy communities on the impact of moving firm activities offshore on innovation back in the U.S.  Previous work by the P.I. has shown that moving manufacturing offshore changes technology development incentives.  Specifically, her results show that when U.S. firms shift production from the U.S. to developing East Asia, the most advanced technologies that were developed in the U.S. no longer pay.  Production characteristics are different abroad, and earlier technologies can be more cost-effective in developing country environment.  Building on these results, this project seeks to understand the impact of manufacturing offshore on (1) the innovative activities of the firms that moved manufacturing offshore, and (2) the continued advance of the advanced technologies within the same or other institutions in the U.S. In the case of the first part of the study, the results demonstrate whether firms which relocated manufacturing offshore are following a different technology trajectory from those firms still manufacturing in the U.S.  In the case of the second part of the study, the results shed insight into whether the relocation of manufacturing offshore has, in the case of the ecosystem of study, shifted the institutional locus of innovation. Broader Impact: In recent years, there has been rising concern over the ability of the U.S. to remain competitive in the global economy. Understanding how innovation ecosystems react to a set of innovating firms moving activities offshore is critical to redefining U.S. science and innovation policy and to improving the resiliency of such systems. The results of this study shed insights into the significance of institutional location -- small versus large firms, universities, or government labs -- on the quantity and direction of innovation.  Leveraging these results, the project characterizes critical metrics of innovation ecosystems that may aid in their resiliency against shocks such as a large set of innovating firms moving manufacturing offshore.  Metrics may include such units as coupling intensity between manufacturing location and innovative output, institutional fluidity, firm-university patent-publication interdependency, and other metrics that emerge from the result of the study.  These metrics can be used immediately by policy-makers to assess ecosystem resiliency, and will enable academics to build on them in future work characterizing industry ecosystems. Finally, the particular technology of study -- optoelectronics -- is critical to advance in communications, computing, and sensing.  Understanding the policy levers to continue technology development in optoelectronics may be essential to U.S. economic and military leadership',\n",

       " 'SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking',\n",

       " 'Immigration is a major area of concern shaping contemporary policy, practice and debate in the United States. As a large scale agent of change, shifts in policy and perceptions concerning immigrants ripple through social networks, affecting household arrangements and resources that impact not only individuals, but families and whole communities. These impacts are felt by immigrants, naturalized citizens and natives who share the same communities, households and families. Recent research suggests that social networks among the urban poor can be eroded by macro-level economic and political uncertainty and instability, but comparatively little is known about how this process unfolds. Clear scientific evidence demonstrating how people are affected by such policy shifts can provide evidence for developing immigration-related policy and practice with fewer negative unintended consequences. With backgrounds in sociology, anthropology, human biology, geography and demography, the project team examined Latino households with at least one Spanish-speaking adult in south Phoenix, Arizona. Households were recruited by partnering with Latino community educators who are well-established in the area. Field interviews were conducted by bilingual students at Arizona State University. Using a range of tools and methods, including social network analysis and mathematical modeling, researchers determined if and how the households reorganized in response to changing immigration policy and practice. The study examined the social networks that link household members to each other and larger networks, and model the implications of this for the resource flows to household members and ultimately for household resiliency and the well-being of family members. Agent-based models were then applied to examine the potential impact of future large-scale shifts in immigration perceptions and policies.By focusing on the mechanism of social networks?as the framework in which decisions concerning resource flows are made, played out, and constrained?the study empirically ties well-being of household members to social policy shifts outside the household in new and more explicit ways. The project?s unique approach to data construction makes it possible to clarify the potential for changes in immigration enforcement or employer sanction laws to impact individuals who may or may not be directly targeted by these policies. At the local level, the data, findings, and related outreach activities will contribute to the development of research capacities within the target community and raise public awareness. Research findings, such as determining which factors enhance household stability and how social networks can be leveraged to move limited resources where they are most needed, were shared with local stakeholders to support their goals of building healthy communities',\n",

       " \"It is important to understand how people in our society, including our leaders and people in mission-critical positions, make decisions in various stressful contexts.  A major area of research in cognitive psychology describes how people make decisions as a process of information accumulation over time.  These theories state that people make better (more accurate) choices if they have enough time to accumulate relevant evidence. A strength of the information accumulation theories is that they explain why speedy responding, perhaps under stress, is often erroneous responding.  Much experimental evidence supports the information accumulation theories.   However, this evidence comes from experimental tasks embedded within a larger experimental context, a context that includes temporal constraints such as when the different components of the task are presented and when decisions are required.  That is, psychology experiments (and many real-world decision problems) have a rhythm within which decision problems are framed and solved, and this rhythm also exerts an influence on decision performance.  The importance of task rhythm is underscored by another theoretical perspective which emphasizes the dynamic aspects of the choice environment.  In this perspective, attention is viewed as a dynamic process attuned to the underlying task rhythm, and understanding how the pace of the environment interacts with how effectively people focus attention is critical for understanding the decision-making process.  This proposal offers an integrated theory  that formally combines the information accumulation and dynamic attending approaches.  The proposed experiments test predictions of the hybrid model with regard to effects of task difficulty, pacing and rhythm, and the role of instructions and feedback.  This research is significant because it links choice behaviors to contextual factors that shape people's attention, thus allowing them to  tune in  to relevant information more or less effectively.  It will improve our understanding of choice performance of healthy individuals who must render sometimes critical decisions under time stress, and also, eventually, choice performance of individuals who suffer from a variety of attentional dysfunctions (e.g., attention deficit disorders, autism, etc\",\n",
       " 'Vision is the dominant sensory modality that people use to interact with the external environment and to learn about it. There is behavioral evidence that even relatively short periods of training with action video games can improve performance on some kinds of visual abilities, especially those that allow people to analyze spatial relationships among objects in the environment. For example, after action video game training, people are able to keep track of more objects moving around in the visual world than they could before. This exploratory research addresses three gaps in current understanding. First, the full range of visual abilities that can be improved by action video game training remains unknown. Second, it is not known whether such training could improve learning speed itself during visual tasks, such as those that involve predicting sequences of spatial locations. Third, little is known about the brain changes that enable such improvements. The proposed research will measure performance and brain activation in a group of participants (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) on a battery of visual tasks before and after a two-week action video game training period. The pattern of performance and brain activation changes will reveal the specific visual and learning abilities and brain networks that are modified by video game training.The proposed study will provide preliminary data potentially leading to training-based applications that are important for society. Specifically, the visuospatial abilities that can be improved after action video game practice are used in a broad range of professions. For instance, mathematicians, engineers, architects and many other individuals routinely engaged in tasks that require performing complex mental spatial transformations may benefit from action video game training. This research may be eventually lead to developing effective training video games that maximally take advantage of adult brain plasticity. Information about the precise neural bases of these processes may also lead to innovative educational practices that enhance learning abilities themselves, help people with visuospatial learning disabilities, as in attention deficit disorder, or even to future pharmacological methods to improve performance',\n",
       " \"The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.  Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone. The project also continues the PIs' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public\",\n",
       " 'Automatic, unconscious processes are frequently assumed to be responsible for the systematic patterns of apparently irrational behavior documented by cognitive psychologists.  However, some recent experiments suggest that deliberate conscious thought actually lead to poorer decisions in complex choice situations.  The purpose of this research is to understand what conditions result in automatic / deliberative decision making resulting in superior performance and the sources of these performance advantages.Two sets of experiments will investigate these questions from two opposite directions.  Several studies will examine recent experimental evidence for the efficacy of  unconscious thought  processes.  These experiments ask: (1) is the apparent unconscious thought advantage found in these recent experiments normatively and psychologically real?  And, if so, (2) what are the cognitive mechanisms underlying this unconscious thought advantage; and (3) does this advantage extend to choice situations involving inter-temporal trade-offs and moral dimensions?A second set of experiments starts with biases observed in conscious judgment, and asks whether similar biases in information processing influence the automatic processes engaged by subliminal images.  When participants are exposed to masked images, presented so briefly that they fail to reach conscious awareness, these images nonetheless can  prime  - i.e., facilitate or interfere with - responses to subsequent clearly visible images.  By modifying the content of the subliminal images and the structure of the task, it is possible to ask whether factors that inappropriately bias explicit conscious judgments have similar effects on implicit unconscious priming from subliminal images.This research promises to deepen our understanding of the functions of consciousness, the mechanisms of intuition, and the general relationship between consciousness and rationality.  It should help us to better understand the conditions under which, and the mechanisms by which, conscious and unconscious thought processes lead to improved decisions',\n",
       " \"As team members gain experience working together, team performance improves significantly. These  learning curves  have been observed in many team settings, including software development teams, hospital surgery teams and coal-mining crews.  This research project will examine constituents of team experience in order to learn more about the specific phenomena that underlie learning curve gains. Researchers have attributed some of the performance gains associated with team longevity to the development of  transactive memory  (TM) systems, which involve awareness of who knows and does what on a team. When a team has a well-defined TMS, team members know whom to rely on for specific skills or expertise. A series of laboratory studies will manipulate the match between team members' knowledge and roles and the extent to which team members share a common language. The experiments will examine the separate and interactive effects of these variables on team performance as well as the nature of the task (e.g., its uncertainty, urgency), characteristics of team members (e.g., member diversity), and features of the work context (e.g., whether team performance occurs in a virtual or co-located setting) in order to identify which component of transactive memory (or which interactions) increases team performance.  This research has theoretical and practical implications. Due to the rapid organizational and technological changes prevalent in today's workplace, teams often do not not have the luxury of staying together for extended periods.  By unpacking the constituents of learning curve effects we learn how to promote these effects more quickly. Conversely, we can learn to recognize the conditions in which there can be no substitute for time\",\n",
       " \"This project remedies one of the greatest impediments to rapid progress in the science of science and innovation policy (SciSIP) both as a field of study and as a guide to policy: the lack of an integrated database which can trace the links from government investment in R&D through the path of knowledge creation, its transmission and codification, and ultimately in many cases to commercial uses yielding a better standard of living and better jobs. Specifically, the project completes, validates, demonstrates the utility of, and makes available to the research community the Science & Technology Agents of Revolution (STAR) Database which is a transformative platform technology for analyses in whole or part of the creation, transmission, and use of new scientific and engineering knowledge, the creation of new commercial technologies in pre-existing and/or new firms, and the success of those firms as engines of wealth creation and employment growth. The STAR database integrates and complements key databases on science and innovation by a system of unique IDs for firms and other organizations and for individual scientists and engineers as they appear as principal investigators, authors, dissertation writers or advisors, inventors, and/or firm officers, directors, and key employees. Especially the most productive of these scientists ? the ?star innovators? ? wear many hats simultaneously. The STAR database integrates data on government grants, journal articles, dissertations, patents, venture capital, initial public offerings, and other firm data. It links to major public databases via widely used financial market identifiers. In collaboration with the Census Bureau, the STAR and the Census firm and worker databases are linked by a concordance for use by researchers with access to the Census data. The STAR database will have three tiers: a public graphics-based site primarily oriented toward policymakers and the media, a public site providing access to researchers for downloads and database queries limited to the public constituent databases or aggregates derived from the licensed commercial databases, and on-site access at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) providing researchers access to the complete STAR Database for building take-away analysis datasets.Broader Impacts: This project is designed specifically for broader impact. It will provide a shared database that will advance discovery, and enable research otherwise impossibly expensive for nearly any dissertation student or faculty member not located at one of the few elite institutions where significant parts of the STAR Database are available. Real data will bring excitement to classroom assignments on topics that in the abstract can deaden students' interest. Most of the data are available on-line with the commercially licensed part of the data available for building take-away analysis data sets at the NBER and for use within all the Census Bureau?s Research Data Centers.

       " \"PI: Ghovanloo, MaysamProposal Number: 0828882Problem Statement: The number of people with disabilities is increasing among all age groups, especially the elderly (+65) who currently comprise 12% of the U.S. population. Individuals severely disabled as a result of various causes from spinal cord injuries to stroke, cerebral palsy, and ALS find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help. Despite the wide variety of assistive technologies (AT) available for individuals with lower levels of disabilities, the above population is still considered underserved, and would greatly benefit from having more choices, particularly in utilizing adaptable ATs that can take advantage of whatever remaining capabilities that they might have. We intend to help individuals with little or no upper extremity functions to improve their quality of life by enabling them to control their environment, drive their powered wheelchair (PWC), and access computers by simply moving their tongue. Intellectual Merits: The main purpose of the proposed research is to develop an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low cost, and wireless AT called the 'Tongue Drive' system (TDS), which can potentially substitute some of the arm and hand functions in people with quadriplegia. Conceptually, the TDS consists of an array of small magnetic sensors located inside the mouth, on an orthodontic brace (internal version - iTDS), or outside of the mouth, mounted on a headset (external version - eTDS). The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnet, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping. The sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to an external ultra-portable PC, which is worn by the user. The received data is processed to determine the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors in real time. This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC screen, and to perform all other functions that can be done with a mouse pointer or a joystick. The principal advantage of the TDS is that a few magnetic sensors and an inherently wireless permanent magnet could potentially capture an unlimited number of tongue movements, each of which can represent a specific user command. A set of dedicated tongue movements could be tailored for each individual user based on his/her preferences, lifestyle, and remaining abilities, and mapped onto a set of customized functions for computer, PWC, and environmental access. Thus, TDS can offer a high degree of adaptability and cover a large group of users with different levels of disabilities. In addition, the TDS has the potential to provide its users with proportional control, which makes it a lot easier to maneuver PWCs in crowded and confined spaces. This research also involves a thorough evaluation of the TDS efficacy, usability and user acceptability.Broader Impacts: We intend to help the most severely disabled individuals to live active, selfsupportive, satisfying, and productive lives, equal to the other members of the society. Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities. Solutions such as the TDS could help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in the society, while relieving their family members or dedicated caregivers.Educational Plan: The PI's main educational objective is to stimulate the interests of undergraduate and graduate students by taking advantage of the 'multidisciplinary' nature of the proposed research. Undergraduates will be recruited through senior design and presidential undergraduate research award (PURA) to participate in development of the TDS graphical userinterface. A graduate student will also be involved in the proposed research by developing the TDS hardware and sensor signal processing algorithms as well as helping with human trials\",\n",

The MRSEC's research is centered on studies of new magnetic materials and structures at the nanometer scale, with the aim of developing fundamental understanding of their properties and related phenomena important for advanced technological applications.  QSPINS is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1 'Nanoscale Magnetism: Structures, Materials and Phenomena' focuses on fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials issues in nanoscale magnets, addressing important quantum, electronic structure, nanofabrication, high-sensitivity measurements, and magnetization-dynamics problems.  Nanostructuring has reached a length scale where quantum approaches are needed, and this IRG brings a unique combination of theory, modeling, and new fabrication and measurement methods to the study of novel materials and phenomena.  The expected outcomes are new insights into phenomena and structures important for the development of novel cluster-assembled materials, higher energy-density permanent magnets, and information-technology materials. IRG2 'Magnetoelectric Interfaces and Spin Transport' employs the electron spin in a synergistic combination with novel nanoscale magnetic and ferroelectric structures to manipulate spin-dependent properties to yield new scientific concepts and achieve enhanced functionalities. Designed magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic heterostructures are to be investigated where the interplay between electricity, elasticity, and magnetism across interfaces manifests interesting unexplored phenomena, such as electrically-controlled exchange bias and magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and ferroelectrically-tailored spin transport. QSPINS's education and outreach programs encourage gifted young people to pursue scientific careers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through targeted programs, and improve materials literacy among the general public.  As an integral part of the Center, QSPINS offers interdisciplinary training for the next generation of materials scientists and engineers by providing regional four-year institutions experience and tools to improve their materials science programs and curricula, offering opportunities for middle- and high-school teachers and their students to learn about materials science, and by addressing pre-college segments of the educational pipeline via targeted outreach activities.  QSPINS maintains shared experimental and computational facilities and supports exploratory Seed Projects to provide continual revitalization of the projects and investigators and promote new interdisciplinary collaborations.

Lucas (University of California, Davis)Plants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. Two research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. Several approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. A significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research.

       " 'Despite evidence that innovation has become increasingly collaborative, our understanding of collaborative creativity and its impact on economic productivity remains incomplete.  For example, how should firms structure the collaborations of their inventors, given that networks which enhance the generation of a new idea also appear to hamper the dissemination of that idea?  How does knowledge flow within and between regions and how can policy makers influence those flows for maximal social welfare?  How does investment in scientific research result in peer-reviewed publication, the diffusion of knowledge, invention, and patenting, and ultimate gains in economic productivity?  These questions remain unanswered because social network data are difficult to gather, particularly across time, space, and boundaries.  This proposal allows answering these questions by calculating and posting millions of relational data, based on all co-authorship ties between inventors of U.S. patents, from 1963 through the present.The database complements the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent database by providing the social networks of patent co-authorships.  It creates a standard social network patent database at the individual inventor and aggregate levels including organizational, regional, and technological.  It reduces barriers to entry to scholars who lack the requisite programming skills and hardware to create the data on their own and enables real time graphing of patent co-authorship networks.  It provides a website by which actual inventors can assess the accuracy of the algorithms used to uniquely identify them in the patent database.  Finally, the project provides data on a public website accessible by scholars, business analysts, and students.  Just as the original NBER database has unleashed broad and diverse scholarship on innovation (over 500 papers cite it, according to Google Scholar, by early 2008), the social network database project will unleash a similar wave of research, focused on collaborative creativity and the social networks of inventors and their organizations.Broader Impacts: The research will publish social network data from all U.S. patent co-authorships (1963-present) for use by researchers, students, and business analysts.  It will provide real-time ability to visually illustrate these networks, with a variety of variables illustrated by color and size of the nodes and co-authorship links.  It will enable answering how managers should structure collaborative relationships and how information flows across organizational, regional, and technological boundaries.  It will enable tracing the career productivity and mobility of millions of inventors around the world.  In conjunction with other databases on research grants and scientific publication, it will illuminate the process of knowledge creation and dissemination at many levels of analysis, from the individual, to the organizational, and international.The primary purpose of this project is to make social network data, based on the co-authorship of U.S. patents from 1963 through the present, available to researchers and the public at large.

Increase the number of disciplinary faculty who are contributing toward teacher preparation and who, through inter-departmental, inter-college and school-university partnerships, assume increased responsibility for the mentoring and induction of beginning teachers and the professional development of career teachers;     c.  Address and make demonstrable progress toward overcoming the challenges that impede the ability of universities to strengthen their science teacher preparation programs;      d.  Widely disseminate the results and lessons learned from this and other related projects, especially the lessons learned about: (1) changes in institutional policies and practices that enhance science teacher preparation programs and increase the participation of disciplinary faculty; (2) the programmatic features of exemplary science teacher preparation programs, (3) the features of successful Noyce Scholarship Programs; (4) securing the ongoing and active commitment of top institutional leadership to making teacher preparation - particularly in science and mathematics - a central university enterprise; (5) the role of the disciplinary societies in strengthening science teacher preparation and in the support of practicing teachers; and (6) state policy efforts that can facilitate improvement of science teacher preparation and that remove the disincentive for pursuing a career in teaching; and     e.  Provide support to the national networks of MSP and Noyce Scholarship programs, facilitating communication across these and other networks of science and mathematics education programs',\n",

       " 'It is often difficult to distinguish whether the graduates of a challenging academic program are successful because of their educational experiences, or whether the program simply selected individuals destined for success into the program.  It is usually impossible to conduct a true experiment with random assignment of students to educational opportunities.  However, large-scale shifts in policy can serve as  natural experiments  that change the way students are matched to educational programs and allow us to identify causal consequences of education.The specific research question addressed by this project is:  Do institution-level shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred lead to measurable changes in graduate outcomes?for example: higher earnings, increased participation in the science and engineering workforce, or a larger probability of filing patents?relative to similar earlier graduates? And how does the research inform the science of science policy?Writing in 1994, William Trent and John Hill described a concerted effort by a group of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to expand educational opportunities in engineering, computer science and other technical fields,  to prepare their students for expanded career choices.   Preliminary evidence suggests that a shift in the relative participation of black college graduates in occupations related to engineering, math, computer science, or physical sciences (EMS) occurred at about the same time.  Furthermore, growth in EMS college majors was particularly strong among students most likely to attend HBCUs:  those who attended high school in the South.  The initial phase of this project is designed to distinguish whether the growth was driven by HBCU policies, or by change at other southern institutions.  The second phase involves assembling more than 30 years of data on the number and type of degrees conferred by each U.S. institution of higher education (collected annually by the U.S. Department of Education), analyzing the data to find other examples of large institution-level (or state-level) shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred, and combining this information with data from other sources to discover the resulting educational and economic impacts.The initial phase of this research is designed to reveal the institution-level processes underlying recent expansion of science and engineering participation by a persistently underrepresented minority group.  More generally, the research project expands knowledge about the extent to which exposure to science or engineering education at the undergraduate level changes the set of skills college graduates bring to the labor market, and whether that change is substantial enough to affect a whole host of outcome measures including earnings, occupation, and patent activity. Broader ImpactsThe knowledge gained from this research project informs individual-level career-path choices as well as educational and workforce policies.

       " 'Trace metal sample handling and analysis have led to the discovery that tiny (nanomolar) levels of metals such as iron are having profound influences on the diversity, abundance, and carbon fixation of primary producers in the oceans. One of these important primary producers, marine cyanobacteria, have similarly been shown to be affected, positively and negatively, by copper (natural and anthropogenic) levels and may also be influenced by cobalt and nickel levels. At the same time, cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton are changing the distributions of metals and their reactivity through uptake, which causes measurable depletion of metals in surface waters, and through the extra-cellular production of metal binding ligands. Because of the importance of copper in aquatic environments, the PIs will characterize copper metabolism in marine cyanobacteria using model Synechococcus strains from oligotrophic environments and from coastal environments that have very different metal physiologies revealed by the whole genome sequencing projects. They will characterize how the strains respond to different copper levels using whole genome microarrays that probe the global response of the cell and will combine these studies with state of the art characterization of intracellular metal levels and other measures of cellular physiology and photosynthetic capacity. Molecular genetics studies of diverse copper associated genes will be undertaken to determine their function in the cell. Preliminary results have found a potential candidate for an intracellular copper binding protein that is conserved in all marine cyanobacteria. At the same time, preliminary results have found that coastal cyanobacteria have greater resistance to copper than open ocean species and this might be due to a novel copper binding or efflux system. The PIs will illustrate the importance of copper in aquatic environments by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science.Broader Impacts This research will reveal some of the major mechanisms by which marine cyanobacteria have adapted to metal levels in coastal and oligotrophic environments. Thus these results will help us understand the distribution and diversity of these organisms in relation to global primary productivity. They should lead to more robust biomarkers for metal stress and pollution in coastal environments. The PIs will expand on a previous outreach activity like their museum exhibit on marine genomics at the Birch Aquarium, La Jolla CA, by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science, inspire environmental action, and increase exposure to marine habitats.

The assessments are in the areas of (1) number and operations, (2) pre-algebra and algebra, and (3) geometry and measurement and are based in the literature on student's cognitive growth in these mathematical domains.  The instruments are aligned with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Focal Points and with existing  mathematics knowledge for teaching  (MKT) classroom observation instruments.  These assessments differ from existing assessments in that the questions require more complex responses than typical multiple-choice problems.  Yet, they are still machine-scoreable so they can easily be used in studies with large student samples.  Additionally, these assessment instruments enable researchers to capture student growth nested within classrooms, which provides a tool that is able to identify teacher effects on learning.  By comparing students of teachers without MSP  treatment  to students of teachers with MSP treatment in a quasi-experimental design, this research project examines the effects of teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) growth on classroom instruction and student achievement.  The project expects to find that high teacher scores on the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) measures are correlated with the size of student gains on the new assessment instruments.  Additionally, this project adds to the suite of instruments available from the LMT for exploring the connection between teacher learning, teachers' MKT, their classroom instruction, and student outcomes\",\n",
       " 'Salinity variations in the geologic past are difficult to reconstruct, yet important for understanding climate, ocean circulation, evolutionary biology, and carbon storage in the geologic record. In an effort to develop a new indicator of water salinity we will build on recent experimental results indicating that hydrogen isotope fractionation in algal lipids decreases as salinity increases.Intellectual Merit: Motivated by a recent report by Schouten et al. (2006) that salinity altered hydrogen isotope fractionation in lipids from cultured coccolithophorid algae, and the prospect this finding raises for paleosalinity and paleohydrologic reconstructions, investigators propose to test the generality of a salinity influence on lipid D/H fractionation in a variety of algal, microbial and archaeal lipids in a wide diversity of natural saline systems with salinities between 0.4 - 277 ppt.  Their initial results from Christmas Island and the Chesapeake Bay support the hypothesis of Schouten et al. (2006) that D/H fractionation in algal and microbial lipids decreases with increasing salinity. At Christmas Island they find a strong inverse correlation between salinity and lipid D/H fractionation in several algal and bacterial biomarkers and total lipid extracts over the salinity range 17 - 149 ppt . In the Chesapeake Bay they observe a strong inverse relationship between salinity and D/H fractionation in the dinoflagellate lipid dinosterol at salinities between 8 - 31 ppt.The proposed study will use water, particulate and surface sediment samples from 39 globally dispersed saline basins in Canada, the USA, Bolivia, Israel, South Africa, Kazhakstan, and the Galapagos Islands. This highly diverse set of lakes was chosen to span the widest possible range of salinities, limnologies, water chemistries, and climates. They will measure the &#948;D values of several different lipid biomarkers from algae (e.g., dinosterol, highly branched isoprenoid alkenes, fucoxanthin, botryococcenes), bacteria (e.g., diploptene, hopanoids, bacteriochlorophyll a-e) and archaea (glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol-tetraethers) in suspended particles and surface sediments in each lake, and compare those values to the &#948;D values of lake water. They possess all samples for this study.Broader Impacts: This project will support a female graduate student and facilitate the education of undergraduate and high school students in environmental research. Of 11 lab members, 5 are women, 4 are undergraduates and 1 is in high school. Two undergraduates, along with the PI, conducted the fieldwork to collect the saline lake samples for this project in June 2007.

       " \"This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists. It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project's main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students' relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. This Project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This Project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border\",\n",
       " \"This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&D over U.S. R&D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future\",\n",
       " \"NEBRASKA MATH is to improve achievement for all students and narrow achievement gaps among at-risk populations by focusing on three key transition points along the mathematics continuum: the mathematics education of children in transition from kindergarten through early primary to grade 3; the algebra transition from middle to high school and the transition of new secondary math teachers from certification to the classroom.  The project is focused on four strategies; (i) Developing an active and mature partnership (sustained through state dollars after the end of NSF funding) by linking mathematics teachers and school administrators from across Nebraska with university mathematicians and mathematics educators and early childhood educators to improve mathematics education statewide; (ii) Strengthening the mathematical and pedagogical knowledge for teaching of participating teachers and their professional interactions with other teachers in their schools, while improving their attitudes to the teaching and learning of mathematics; (iii) Improving students' competence, beliefs and attitudes about mathematics, their appreciation of the importance of sustained effort, and their knowledge of mathematics; and (iv)) Contributing to the research in mathematics education through a mixed methods research design studying K-3 teacher's knowledge, attitudes, and leadership in relation to student disposition and achievement.A goal of the project is to create a model partnership, both on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) campus and nationally, where faculty in an academic discipline (in this case mathematics) and faculty in education work with teachers and administrators from the K-12 education community, sharing expertise and resources in pursuit of a world class mathematics education system.  NEBRASKA MATH partners the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with four school districts and 15 Educational Service Units (ESUs), in rural Nebraska, which provide support to 63 additional school districts.  The intent is to form a permanent K-16 mathematics partnership that is sustained primarily by local dollars.

       " \"The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone. The project also continues the PIs' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public\",\n",
       " \"SES 0601801Vilna BashiRutgers UniversityOver the last 10 years, the number of adoptions of foreign-born children completed by American parents has increased tenfold over a wide number of countries, to the point where such adoptions number over 20,000 foreign-born children each year. Prospective parents tend to be racially white, professional class, and wealthier than average. This project is designed to answer two research questions regarding this surging phenomenon. The first is: How do agents adopting American parents and international adoption agencies make decisions about how they racially identify foreign born adopted children and racially represent the nations from which the children come? The answer is not predictable from the large and growing literature on what has been variously called racial formation, racialization, and ethnoracial assignment. These writings reinforce the idea that race is a system constructed on a premise that some people are more deserving of privilege and preference than others, but they also suggest that racial advantage and disadvantage is not doled out in a manner fixed for all time. Racial privilege, instead, evolves with changing political and economic circumstances. Much of this work is historically based, using legal and historical analysis to re-tell the story of this historical change over time. The project differs in that it attempts to capture a contemporary and ongoing racialization process. A second question asks: What is the relationship between gender and race in the international adoption process? This search for the foreign-born can be said to be racially motivated, as scholars have suggested that American race and class dynamics have created a  shortage  of desirable This  project studies a more contemporary manifestation of the racial assignment process by looking at the ways agents involved in placing foreign-born children in American homes construct those children's races, and help to set their racial identities, and to examine the relationship between gender and race in these processes. The principal investigator will use qualitative research methods to study the racial assigning processes in  three sites in which they occur. The first site focuses on adoption agencies' representations, via a content analysis of the print materials they provide to prospective parents, and through their websites. A second site of research examines the growing cultural dialog on international adoption as expressed in advice books on  how to  undertake an intercountry adoption, raise a child different from oneself, and ensure your child learns his/her  culture.  There is also a nascent but expanding children's literature on international adoption meant to comfort children who are foreign-born and/or explain the adoption to them as they grow. The PI will use content analysis in order to examine how print and visual media and other sites for advice in international adoptive childrearing (e.g. cultural camps) contribute to or hope to influence the racialization of these children. Finally, the PI will interview parents who have adopted foreign-born children  to understand parents' thoughts and processes about the (inter-) racial aspects of international adoption, and learn about their  practices in raising their foreign-born child. The broader impacts of this work include training undergraduate and graduate students.  Results will be disseminated widely and the data will be made available to other researchers interested in replication and reanalysis. This data availability contributes to strengthening qualitative research methods\",\n",

Community of Soundscapes will employ newly developed mobile computing and collaborative mapping technology in programs that help users gain greater insights and stake into the shared environment in which they live and visit.  Sound Camera, a digital recording device outfitted with GPS mapping software, allows users to collect audio clips of their sonic experiences as they explore their cities, parks and other environments and upload them online onto a digital map through a Web 2.0 application.  They can then compose, annotate, and share soundscapes of the places where the sounds were recorded.  A Web site will be developed to expand the project?s reach to audiences not in the Boulder programs.  Professional development training will be provided for collaborators and through the Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education.

       " 'Packing and covering are dual notions that are basic in combinatorial optimization and in combinatorics, in general. They are different and yet very closely related. One important instance of combinatorial packing problems is that of graph packing. Graphs of size n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices. Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G. Important examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and Ramsey-type problems. These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models for many important applications. Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.The main thrust of the project is to explore a series of extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of their vertices. It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished. The particular packing problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning, and load balancing problems. It will be studied also from an algorithmic viewpoint. A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign',\n",

       " \"Public science and engineering (S&E) funding agencies worldwide rely on the peer review of research proposals to make their funding decisions.  Scientific and technical experts are best qualified to judge the scientific and technical merits of proposed research projects.  Increasingly, however, society is requiring that S&E funding agencies demonstrate a return on the public investment in S&E research.  In response, S&E funding agencies worldwide have incorporated considerations of broader societal impacts into the proposal review process.  But asking scientists and engineers to assess the potential societal impacts of proposed research projects takes them beyond the realm of their scientific and technical expertise.  The fundamental question of this three year research project is: What is the best way to incorporate societal impacts considerations into the grant proposal peer review process?  This research focuses on the ways in which different models of peer review incorporate the broader societal impacts of proposed research. The study assesses five different models of peer review across three US federal agencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and two non-US contexts: the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Dutch Technology Foundation (STW).  Using both qualitative and quantitative methods (data mining, literature review, surveys, and semi-structured interviews), this research develops usable knowledge by constructing a comparative matrix and analysis of these five models of peer review.The Broader Impacts of this project include: (1) funding 2 graduate research assistants, thereby laying the foundation for continuing work in the Science of Science and Innovation Policy; (2) integrating this research with teaching at the undergraduate level (in UNT's Ethics in Science course); (3) expanding the network of researchers exploring the Science of Science and Innovation Policy; (4) enhancing the understanding of the process of grant proposal peer review by informing all stakeholders in the peer review process (scientists and engineers, funding agency officials, policy makers, and members of the general public) of the project's results; and finally, (5) improving the peer review of grant proposals, especially in terms of the capacity of various models of peer review to assess the societal impact of proposed S&E research.  This project benefits society by improving the connection between the funding decisions rendered through proposal peer review and the societal impact of the funded research\",\n",
       " 'CAREER: A Theoretical Foundation for Achievability and Optimization in         Privacy-Preserving Data MiningData mining has been successfully applied to support a variety of applications, including marketing, weather forecasting, medical diagnosis, and homeland security. Mining data without violating the privacy of data being mined, however, is still a critical challenge. How to mine patientsÕ personal information, for example, is an ongoing problem in healthcare applications. Emerging privacy legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as the heightened public concerns about privacy protection, require immediate and resolute attention from the computing community on the protection of private information in data mining.This research involves the understanding, analysis, and optimization of the tradeoff between privacy protection, accuracy of data mining, and system resources in privacy-preserving data mining.  The methodology is to establish a solid theoretical foundation that defines the requirements for privacy protection in data mining, identifies the domain of privacy-preserving strategies, and determines the achievability of such strategies.  This theoretical foundation enables the design and optimization of privacy-preserving data mining algorithms that are realistic, generic, and efficient.  The research results of this project have broader impacts on the nationÕs higher education system and high-tech industries.  The ability to mine private data without violating the privacy of data owners is a must for a wide variety of corporations, universities, hospitals, and government agencies. Similarly, theoretically and empirically validated means to protect privacy in data mining would benefit all privacy-concerned individuals at large.  The impact of this project also extends to academia through educational efforts, including graduate and undergraduate student training, curriculum development, seminars, and outreach',\n",
       " 'For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms.  Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds.

This activity builds on work done during the Tougaloo?s first five year HBCU-UP project.  Other retention activities will include attention to co-curricular STEM activities, including support of STEM clubs on campus, and the development of a new one-credit freshman course for STEM majors.New pedagogy based on NSF funded Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) will be implemented in various courses, beginning with chemistry.  In addition to the focus on gatekeeper courses, the curriculum development will include the use of web-based laboratories and development of new upper level courses to prepare students use of current scientific tools.  Some courses proposed will incorporate informatics (including data mining tools), nano chemistry and biology, and in-silico biology and drug discovery.  Activities aimed at recruitment, as well as ensuring better preparation of incoming students, are the summer pre-matriculation program that will impact 40 high school students per year, and coordinating with surrounding secondary schools to offer Physics.  Tougaloo College is among US top 20 producers of female, undergraduate physics majors.  The proposal points to an acute shortage of persons qualified to teach physics in the surrounding schools.  In order to address this, the Tougaloo physics department will direct the offering of physics for high school students, which will be taught on weekends and evenings.Faculty and student research will be supported both on campus through the availability of faculty research grants, and off campus through collaborations with other institutions and laboratories',\n",

       " \"0754379MunnThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Michael R. Munn to work with Dr. Peter M. Topping at Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick in the UK.The aim of this project is to work closely with Dr. Peter Topping and the Geometric Analysis group of the Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick. First, the PI aims to continue his research studying the influence of volume growth on the topology of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Second, the PI aims to study the consequences of a lower bound on Ricci curvature in the more general setting of metric measure spaces. This concept is on the forefront of research in geometric analysis and has only recently been developed. As such there are many fundamental open questions. Lastly, the PI aims to study the behavior of Ricci flow in this more general setting and determine any topological or geometric consequences for the underlying metric space. Recently, Fields Medalist Perelman has used Hamilton?s Ricci flow to solve the century old Poincare conjecture. These fields are being actively pursued by researchers within the Mathematics Institute at Warwick, most notably by Dr. Topping, thus making Warwick an ideal place for this fellowship research. Dr. Topping is a leading expert in geometric analysis and has employed the techniques of geometric flows, such as Ricci flow and mean curvature flow, with great success. Dr. Topping is one of only a few mathematicians studying e nature of Ricci flow on metric measure spaces.  An understanding of Ricci curvature and Ricci flow in metric spaces is of great importance in geometric analysis and metric geometry. These original concepts have only recently been introduced and are on the forefront of research in geometric analysis. In Perelman?s work, he did not address the Ricci flow when singularities develop and this has been an important question of Hamilton, Lott, and others. In a very recent paper, Topping and McCann introduce a notion of Ricci flow for metric spaces. These advances are of great importance as they can be used to understand the development of these singularities. The PI?s current research involves prior work of Perelman?s involving Ricci curvature. The PI also extends these results to metric measure spaces. The Mathematics Institute at Warwick is a thriving environment and is undergoing rapid expansion. The large number of resources available within the Institute make this an ideal host site.  Currently there is great interest in the development of these new ideas for Ricci flow in metric spaces and these techniques have applications across the physical sciences. The ideas related to Ricci flow are closely related to those of mean curvature flow as well as crystal flow. Understanding the development of singularities in this context is essential. In particular, singularities describe the development of flaws in crystals. A deeper understanding of the implications of this research will enable the PI to be a better professor at a university with science majors and engineers\",\n",
       " \"This project develops a methodology and statistically implements a data collection and evaluation process for assessing the innovative performance of firms located on U.S. university research parks (URPs).  The results from the assessment phase inform the public and private sector about locational investments in science and engineering (S&E) activities occurring on URPs.  URPs have been an important element of our national innovation system for nearly half a century, and in 2007 the  Building a Stronger America Act  (S. 1373) was introduced in Congress under the stated premise that it is in the best interests of the Nation to encourage the formation of new parks and the expansion of existing parks in order to promote the clustering of innovation through high technology activities.  Surprisingly, very little research has been undertaken on science/research parks, in general, or URPs, in particular.  And, no research has been undertaken on the innovation benefits realized by firms that locate on U.S. parks.  This project broadens our understanding of URPs as a component of our national innovation system; develops an assessment tool for assessing the innovation benefits realized by firms as a result of locating on a park; collects relevant data to implement this methodology and offers empirically-based statements on realized innovation benefits from on-park research synergies; and offers prospective statements about the organizational structure of URPs that will be most conducive to enhancing the research synergies among park firms on new or expanded parks.BROADER IMPACTS:  The main intellectual outputs from this research are an assessment of the innovative performance of, and research outputs from, on-park firms relative to comparable firms that are not located on a park.  As such, this project's broader impacts include, from a national perspective, the development of park-based science metrics and policy prescriptions to enhance university-driven S&E-based economic development through park formations and park growth.  And, from a private-sector perspective, this project informs the locational consideration, and hence future research efficiency, of firms' S&E investments.  The project's resulting science metrics inform the consideration of new innovation indicators specifically related to parks.  The project's policy prescriptions inform not only Congressional deliberations related to the  Building a Stronger America Act  but also future state and regional S&E investment considerations for building new UPRs and/or expanding existing ones\",\n",
       " \"An extraordinary explosion of new information on the human genome is becoming available from scientific research. One of the many facets of this enterprise is the characterization of the variation in gene frequencies that exists among human populations. Gene frequency variation among the world's populations has arisen from the net effect of all the genetically relevant chance and systematic events in the history of those populations past and present population sizes, the relative degree of endogamous and exogamous mating practices and how they varied over time, natural selection dynamics as the disease environment and climate changed, and the numerous subdivisions and mergers of ancient populations as humans spread around the world. The knowledge scientists are accumulating of the extant patterns of genetic similarity among human populations provides useful information to the many different areas where researchers are working to understand the roles those diverse factors have played in human evolution. This includes human relationships with other species from microbes to the other great apes as well as the more recent relationships among the human populations of the world as reflected in written histories. The Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED), created at Yale University in 2000 with support from NSF, makes data on human genetic variation broadly available for research and education. This award will support 3 specific aims supporting the overall goal of integrating into ALFRED the data just now becoming available from various research teams studying enormous numbers of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a few to as many as several dozen populations from around the world. The number of SNPs studied in these 'very high throughput' or VHT projects ranges from several hundred thousand to about 2 million SNPs distributed across the human chromosomes. The first specific aim focuses on greatly expanding the contents of ALFRED by automating the curation process sufficiently to facilitate the addition of these very large data sets. Other data from the scientific literature will continue to be incorporated with priority given to SNP results from populations not already represented in the database. The second aim of this project enhances the educational and research value of ALFRED by improving the Geographic Information System (GIS) interface, especially by allowing greater flexibility in the graphical display of data. The third aim is to enhance the user-friendly interface generally in order to help users access the vastly expanded contents. New and more flexible methods will be created to facilitate assembling and downloading useful subsets of the huge multi-population and multi-marker datasets. These improvements will also include expanding the explanatory text and static graphics for educating the users about the use of the database as well as background information on the nature of the information contained in the database. Currently, ALFRED is a fairly large database with almost 280,000 gene frequency tables based on more than 650 human populations studied very unevenly on more than 14,700 polymorphisms along with detailed population and marker descriptions and links to other informative databases. The addition of the data from the VHT projects will vastly increase the scale of the database on the polymorphism dimension requiring a variety of adjustments to help users as outlined in specific aims 2 and 3 in order to take advantage of the wealth of new information. These improvements and expansions to ALFRED will magnify the value of this resource for research and education in anthropological genetics and many other interdisciplinary sciences (such as archaeology, demography, linguistics, forensics, ethnography, and medical research) that already make use of the database. ALFRED thus will be strengthened in the service of a variety of functions for education and for interdisciplinary research. The enhanced GIS interface will help summarize information for various emerging new disciplines such as geographical genetics and existing disciplines such as genetic epidemiology. ALFRED will be able to provide even more reference gene frequencies for comparison with new data sets that researchers develop. The database can also assist in the planning of future studies by helping researchers focus on combinations of genetic markers and population samples that can test various research questions or to identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled in by collecting new datasets. In the broadest sense, the expansion of ALFRED supports a wide array of disciplines and educational efforts aimed at providing a better understanding of our biological history as a species. Additionally, one of the most effective means to combat the misuse of genetic information is to make data regarding genetic variation in our species widely available through facilities like ALFRED\",\n",
       " \"The stable isotope chemistry of water is a powerful tool for probing the atmospheric water cycle and has been used to advance our understanding of water vapor dynamics around the globe. Until recently, measuring water vapor isotope ratios was a time-consuming and laborious process, but advances in spectroscopic techniques now allow automated, real-time, nearly continuous measurements of the 18O/16O and 2H/1H (or D/H) ratios in water vapor. In addition, advances in remote sensing of Earth's infrared emission spectrum at high resolution now allow the atmospheric deuterium abundance to be mapped globally. These new technologies are very promising for climate studies, but we do not fully understand the biases in these new measurements, nor do we know how measurements made with these new technologies compare with one another and with the more traditional and labor-intensive mass spectrometric techniques involving vacuum flask collection and cryogenic trapping. Before the full potential of the new spectroscopic methods for water vapor isotope measurements can be realized in climate research, a program of instrument validation and intercomparison must be performed. The PIs will make measurements of water vapor isotopologues at the NOAA observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii using three different laser-based sensors and two different satellites, which will be validated against traditional mass spectrometry techniques applied to samples collected on site. The goal of this study is to compare the different measurement techniques in order to assess of the fidelity of these new measurement technologies and to provide new data on the processes that control the humidity of the subtropical Pacific. This comprehensive set of measurements will be made from October 12-24, 2008, in conjunction with the AGU Chapman Conference  Atmospheric Water Vapor and its Role in Climate , which will be held in Kona, Hawaii. The opportunity for this project has emerged from recent discussions between the PIs and colleagues from industry, NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Service d'aéronomie in Paris. A number of important resources are being made available for this project at little or no cost to this grant. The timing seems to be fortuitous as several of the scientists involved are planning to be in Hawaii for the Chapman conference, and the other resources happen to be available at the same time. Intellectual Merit Measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues provide important information about the Earth's hydrologic cycle, and new technologies promise to expand our understanding of the use and limitations of such measurements. The project will help to establish the foundation for climate studies using these new technologies by providing the first intercomparison between different ground and satellite-based techniques. The results of this study will be used to better understand optimal system configurations for climatological studies of water vapor isotopes and determine biases in emerging remote-sensing technologies. Moreover, the data from this project will help to constrain models of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle by providing the first continuous measurements of water isotopologues from an arid subtropical mid-ocean site. Broader Impacts The results of this intercomparison project will be important for the broader community of atmospheric water vapor isotope researchers as they begin to make use of the new array of remote sensing and laser-based techniques. The low humidity conditions atop Mauna Loa will test the limitations of the surface-based spectroscopic techniques and provide a sound footing for understanding the reliability of the instruments under extreme but climatologically important conditions. The results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at national conferences and will inform algorithm and instrument development in the United States and in Europe. The project will promote the training of graduate students by including them in the field program and data analysis. During the first week of the program, JPL scientists will make informal presentations to the students from University of New Mexico and Colorado University on water isotope measurement techniques and algorithms. During the second week of the program, the students will participate in the Chapman Conference, and the PIs will invite other graduate students attending the conference to join them in the field, either before the conference begins, or during the planned field excursion to the Mauna Loa Lab by conference attendees, which will also include a presentation about this project. In addition, this project will foster partnerships with industry (Picarro and Los Gatos) and with European colleagues associated with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer instrument\",\n",
       " \"Adaptation to the impacts of climatic change is now at the forefront of scientific inquiry and policy negotiations, but the current debate has contributed little to the understanding of the decision-making processes that shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods.  This interdisciplinary research project hypothesizes that cyclical (loop) learning enhances people's anticipatory capacity, which is reflected in more flexible and dynamic local and regional adaptation plans.  The investigators propose a resilience-enhancing approach that emphasizes an iterative way of analyzing and learning about changes and uncertainties in the past, present, and future.  By focusing explicitly on learning processes and decision-support tools, this project is expected to reverse the deterministic notion of presumably vulnerable groups as passive victims of climate change by highlighting people's skills, knowledge, strategic responses, anticipatory capacity, and agency for adaptation planning.  Research will be conducted in selected rural communities in Ghana and Tanzania using methods from the learning sciences, rural sociology, cultural geography, and participatory action research to understand how anticipatory learning (learning that helps people anticipate and adapt to change) occurs on the ground and how it can be enhanced.The contributions of this project are expected to be threefold:  (1) a theory regarding how anticipatory learning works in the context of climate change; (2) initial measures of people's individual and collective capacity for anticipation; and (3) pilot interventions for anticipatory learning tools.  The project will address new and important questions in decision theory with respect to processes that permit some communities to better adapt to change than others; relationships among social configuration, learning practices, and decision making under climatic risk; and dynamics in knowledge creation and action.  The project also will provide immediate benefits for the study populations, training opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa, and findings that have high potential impact on the pressing human impacts of climate change.  Through co-design of adaptation tools and interventions in Ghana and Tanzania, the research will foster people's capacity to influence their future through iterative planning rather than learning by shock.  The study will involve students in the U.S. in three ways:  (1) graduate and undergraduate students educated and trained through their direct participation in the conduct of this project; (2) undergraduate students enrolled in a course on climate change adaptation and study abroad in Africa; and (3) an interdisciplinary graduate seminar to design anticipatory learning tools with African colleagues.  The U.S. investigators will work closely with researchers and practitioners at African partner institutions (the University of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, the University of Ghana, and the Afram Plains Development Organization (APDO) as well as with disaster risk and development organizations (CARE International and the Red Cross/Red Crescent).

A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases,when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a newassociation between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersiveenvironment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpectedperformance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on ourunderstanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments andcomputing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as acomputational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3Dtele-immersive spaces\",\n",

ICSU will conduct these activities in large part through the efforts of its Environment Science Officer.Other ICSU environmental activities will include: representation of science (especially research) interests in activities of the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), in particular in development of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS); promoting and encouraging international efforts to assure the effective and timely international exchange of scientific data and information; and the convening of international scientific meetings to advance research in the geosciences and environment, in particular, in the area of global change research.Assuming that ICSU's reviews of the ESSP and WCRP referred to above are positive, ICSU will continue its partial funding of the ESSP and WCRP program coordination activities.  The WCRP will continue to provide the structure that enables physical climate system researchers to develop long-term and short-term international strategic plans addressing key research questions, coordinate international activities on a tremendous range of scales, and engage in and seek out new opportunities for interdisciplinary research activities.  The WCRP will also be responsible for development of the increased knowledge and tools needed for operational and experimental climate forecasting. ICSU will expand and improve its efforts to advance research in the geosciences in developing countries - most especially in Africa - but in other parts of the developing world as well.A focus of ICSU's efforts will be to more effectively address the need to assure that the results of international research under its aegis are transmitted effectively to policy-makers and stake holders\",\n",
       " 'The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), which is comprised of 36 tribally-controlled colleges and universities (TCUs) in the United States, in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is developing an Indigenous Geosciences course series that integrates traditional American Indian knowledge and perspectives on climate, weather, and water with state of the art Geoscience tools and practices.  The series is focused on climate, weather, and water processes and issues that are particularly relevant to American Indian communities and tribal lands and is expected to provide a foundation for TCU students interested in climate change.  The courses are being designed to provide American Indian and other students the opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the physical, cultural, and technological issues associated with climate change and the mitigation of its effects on the earth and its people.  The course series has two components.  The first is a semester-long undergraduate climate change science course taught from the perspective of the traditional ecological knowledge held by Native peoples of North America.  The second is an Indigenous-based research practicum using Cyberinfrastructure-enabled access to Geosciences data, instrumentation and computing resource that provides an opportunity for Tribal College students to practice state-of-the-art e-Science, in collaboration with elders, community members, and research mentors at NCAR.   The project is being evaluated using the NSF-supported Indigenous Framework for STEM evaluation and should result in a program that can be used throughout all TCUs and other institutions of higher education',\n",
       " 'For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization',\n",

The approach is to develop and assemble sub-systems that can be programmed by neuroscientists to investigate scientifically and medically relevant neurophysiology.Intellectual MeritThe proposed wireless neural recording system consists of scaleable sub-system components that can be configures to acquire a broad range of neural signals.  Furthermore, it includes a digital-signal-processing architecture that performs on-chip spike detection and alignment steps in the digital domain, which are typically performed off-chip in software.  The proposed system also must operate while being subject to varying electrode conditions (i.e., impedance and offset voltage) while dissipating no more than several milliwatts of power to avoid tissue heating and enable (future) methods of wireless power transfer.Broader ImpactThe broader impacts include of the proposed work include: (1) technological transformation of important fields of research in neuroscience and neurology, (2) updating and enhancing the technological capabilities and experience of doctoral students training to be brain researchers or neuroengineers, (3) the involvement of undergraduate engineering students from underrepresented groups, and (4) the general education of California high-school teachers and community-college instructors that participate in annual UCLA-sponsored continuing-education events during the summer',\n",
       " 'Optical flow switching has recently emerged as a promising new approach to address the exponentially growing traffic demands in optical networks. In order to realize this new paradigm for optical networks, the core network must be capable of wavelength reconfiguration and service provisioning on time scales approaching one second or faster. The present methods used in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission are designed for static wavelength channels, which can increase in number over time and may be configurable to form different paths at the time of provisioning. Provisioning new wavelengths is a methodical, one at a time, step-wise process of ?turning up? the optical signal along the path, which requires minutes to hours in order to achieve the final stable state, appropriate for GMPLS networks. Furthermore, the extensive literature on optical transmission assumes this quasi-static network environment. The intellectual merit of this project will be to determine both the practical and fundamental limitations on optical flow switched networks imposed by physical layer constraints, including optical transmission in a dynamic, wavelength switching environment. This goal is particularly challenging because of the multi-layer nature of the problem. The network topology and signaling protocols will dictate physical layer transmission requirements, such as how fast the optical signal must achieve an error free condition and over what transmission distance. Likewise the physical limitations both in terms of performance and cost will motivate design choices for the architectures and protocols. In order to address the multi-layer nature of optical flow switched networks, this GOALI project is proposed as a mechanism to utilize the novel optically transparent mesh network testbed facility within Bell Laboratories to extend the network architecture activities within the NSF funded NeTS-FIND Future Optical Network Architectures program at MIT. In particular, targeted experiments will be conducted in the testbed in conjunction with the optical flow switched network optimization studies at MIT. This new testbed has recently been used to study both the power dynamics and the transmission performance of signals in reconfigurable optical networks. These two elements are essential for understanding the physical layer in a transparent switched network and this facility is unique in that it combines these in a broadband, long haul transmission configuration, typical of core networks. This university-industry collaboration will have broader impact at many levels. The problem of scaling optical networks to serve the dramatic rise in internet traffic has broad social ramifications. The project will enable cooperation between two synergistic research efforts to address this important problem: at MIT and at Bell Labs. The academic participants will have the opportunity to work in a premier industrial research laboratory and benefit from the knowledge and skills specific to that environment. In the process, the program will provide a unique opportunity to merge the traditions within both organizations of promoting individual driven',\n",

       " 'Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course',\n",

The prototype will be piloted to families and caretakers of deaf and hard of hearing children to study the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning technology and identify the activities that are most effective in helping deaf children learn life science at informal science centers. The project team will also compile a dictionary of science terms with the intention of including the terms in a full version of the Pictionary. The final Pictionary will be comprehensive; including scientific terms from life, physical, Earth, and space science and will be presented in animated sign language accompanied by written explanations and pictorial illustrations. The project will also produce a video guide with a description of activities that parents can implement with their children. The planning project will result in a prototype with 100 life science terms of species found at the three informal science centers the children and parents will visit to test the prototype. These informal sites are hands-on and exploratory featuring marine organisms and a range of terrestrial flora and fauna to touch and interact with. To prepare for the site visits, parents and caretakers of deaf or hard of hearing children will be taught how to use the Pictionary with children through a Flash-based movie that introduces the interactive features and assists the parents in engaging with their children in three activities using the signing scientific vocabulary. The preparatory vocabulary work with the parents and children will lay the educational foundation for the visits to the informal science education sites. Families will test the initial project prototypes with deaf children using a control group for comparison. Pre-tests will be used to assess childrens' vocabulary before use of the Pictionary. Follow up tests will test knowledge of the new words and will include field observations of children in museums, zoos, and farms, where the new terms will come to life in corresponding exhibits. The results of the ongoing evaluation will be compiled into a guide for other developers of similar materials for the deaf community, and will impact the development of the final project. The project will broaden participation of an underserved audience in STEM learning and generate new knowledge about how to effectively integrate emerging learning technologies into exhibits and programs for deaf learners.The project team includes TERC and Vcom3D and collaborators from Gallaudet University Regional Center at Northern Essex Community College, the College of the Holy Cross, and the Learning Center for Deaf Children.

The NSF-funded ITEST teacher professional development projects address this need by helping teachers effectively integrate real-world IT-based investigations into K-12 curriculum. This ITEST Study will examine the ways that ITEST teacher education projects lead to changes in classroom practice by using two teacher-role models to examine technology-based professional development and related changes in teaching practices: Teacher as Pedagogical Expert (teachers using existing technology-based curriculum with or without adaptations) and Teacher as Curriculum Developer (teachers creating new curriculum). The study will explore these two models within the context of IT teaching and learning. Specifically, we want to understand what kinds of professional development activities promote and/or influence changes in teaching practices and the integration of innovative technologies in the classroom. We will address the following research questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the two teacher-role models (curriculum developer or pedagogical expert) in teacher professional development projects that immerse participants in professional IT experiences? and 2) Does IT classroom implementation differ for teachers who have and have not completed an IT-immersion professional development experience  and does the difference (if any) vary by model?The research design includes a review of current and past ITEST professional development activities (surveys/interviews with project leaders and project artifacts), a broad survey of teacher participants from ITEST teacher education projects, and an in-depth study of a subset of ITEST teacher participants and comparison teachers to trace classroom implementation over an academic year.

They recycle the nutrients that all plants depend upon, they decompose organic materials that would otherwise accumulate, and they convert soil organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, though invisible to the naked eye, soil microbes can influence a suite of global processes, including atmospheric composition and global climate. While the importance of microbial processes is clear, much less is known about the types or numbers of organisms that are responsible for carrying out within-soil processes. This is particularly true for tropical rain forests, the most diverse biomes on land.

       " 'Experimental cybersecurity research is inherently risky. An experiment may involve releasing live malware code, operating a botnet, or creating highly disruptive network conditions. Realism is required in replicating attacks so that proposed defenses can be thoroughly tested and future attacks anticipated. This proposal, in addressing intellectual merit, seeks to develop a unique model for risky experiment management; enabling researchers to carry out experiments that interact with their larger environment while retaining both control and safety. The model forwarded here is based on a very simple line of reasoning: If the behavior of an experiment is completely unconstrained, the behavior of the host environment must be completely constraining, because it can assume nothing about the experiment; but, if the behavior of the experiment is constrained in some particular and well-chosen way or ways, the behavior of the host testbed can be less constraining, because the combination of experiment and environment constraints together can provide the required overall assurance of good behavior.  The key benefit of this model is that both experimenter and testbed operator can proceed with assurance in carrying out a wide and interesting range of previously unsupportable experiments. The ultimate goal is to develop both implementation and formalization of this model, including logical tools to reason about experiment and testbed constraint composition (broader impact). Initial work will develop mechanisms to support the model in the DETER facility and similar Emulab-based testbeds.The proposal was reviewed by panelists and received one Very Good, one Very Good/Good and one Good.  Panelists viewed all three elements of the proposal (risky experimentation support, dynamic health monitoring, and federation of testbeds) to represent contributions to the field, with the most valuable area of the three being risky experimentation support. The panel overall wanted to see a stronger case made for improving existing security testbeds in general, and particularly a tie in with current uses and needs of the DETER testbed by researchers. Panelists recognized the team as being well qualified for the work. If successful, the activities were viewed as advancing the state-of-the-art in experimental facilities for cybersecurity',\n",

       " \"DRL-0822128PI: John RistveyInstitution: Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL)Title: NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale ScienceThis project is exploring the introduction of nanoscience curriculum into high schools. It is creating and studying a professional development model based on two products, the NanoTeach Teacher's Guide and the NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide. The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief. The NanoTeach partnership includes Aspen Associates, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. The research study is being carried out by Aspen Associates, and project evaluation is conducted by Dr. Doug Huffman of the University of Kansas\",\n",
       " \"The Entrepreneurial Leadership in STEM Teaching & learning (EnLiST) Partnership is comprised of Thornton High School District #205, South Holland, IL, Champaign Unit 4 School District, Champaign, IL, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which serves as the lead among these core partners.  In addition, the following are supporting partners: The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), IMSA-affiliated school districts, and Thornton elementary and middle school feeder districts.  EnLiST intends to develop and build the infrastructural elements necessary to sustain a state-wide Illinois community of highly qualified science Teacher Leaders, who will effectively contribute to the transformation of science teaching and learning throughout the K-12 educational continuum in their districts. EnLiST will achieve these goals through a combination of intensive summer institutes and year-round professional development and collaborative activities. The synergy and continuity of these efforts will be ensured through establishment of an on-line community capitalizing on robust technological tools and infrastructure. EnLiST will commence with the development of core cadres of high school chemistry and physics Teacher Leaders organized into district teams. Next, the partnership will support and scaffold the activities of these core cadres as they engage in developing a cadre of middle school and elementary specialist science Teacher Leaders in their school districts. The activities of this latter participant group will focus on an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning in elementary and middle school. Data collection and use will be a central theme in the development of Teacher Leaders and project operation as a whole. The innovation of EnLiST is its intent to reconceptualize the very notion of a  Teacher Leader  by drawing on scholarship in the field of social and entrepreneurial leadership and theories of distributed leadership.  EnLiST aims to create a new generation of Teacher Leaders who, armed with cutting edge content knowledge, a strong pedagogical repertoire, and entrepreneurial spirit, can support their colleagues and transform their schools into responsive and data driven institutions of teaching and learning.  EnLiST will provide participant science Teacher Leaders with understandings, skills, attitudes, and habits of mind enabling them to perceive themselves, and to act, as agents of change.  The entrepreneurial leadership skills that will be developed will arm these Teacher Leaders to meet the many challenges faced by teachers in the current US K-12 educational milieu, including dealing with resource constraints, uncertainty, and multiple goals often related to internally desired and externally imposed demands for change and innovation. They will be equipped to meet the challenges and tensions that have often impeded the adoption of innovative curricula and pedagogies and transformation of K-12 science instructional practices in service of addressing increasingly diverse student population needs. The major research questions of the project will center on understanding and assessing the development of the target Teacher Leaders and the success of those leaders in transforming their own teaching.  The ultimate aim is to develop a scalable national model for the preparation of social and entrepreneurial science Teacher Leaders who act as strong champions and effective initiators and implementors of change in pre-college science teaching and learning.  The EnLiST research questions are: (a) What is the impact, if any, of the project's activities on participant Teacher Leaders' conceptions, attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to social and entrepreneurial leadership? (b) What is the nature of the perceived organizational culture in partner school districts in relation to barriers to, and encouragement of, innovation and change? What are the associated roles of Teacher Leaders and school administrators? (c) What is the differential impact, if any, of enhanced social and entrepreneurial leadership among Teacher Leaders on effecting innovation and change in science teaching and learning in partner school districts\",\n",
       " \"Scientific Research:  A mitotic spindle is present in all known eukaryotic cells and its function is essential for chromosomal segregation and cell division to occur.  Although much work has been directed toward understanding mitotic spindle apparatus structure and function, it is still unclear how chromosome separation is achieved on a microtubule-based structure that is itself in constant flux.  The discovery that microtubules assemble and disassemble at both ends of the spindle fiber and of the constant treadmilling of tubulin dimers toward the poles makes it difficult to envision how forces are generated to actually move the chromosomes on such a metastable structure that is not anchored in place.  For these reasons and based on theoretical considerations of the requirement for force production at the spindle the concept of a spindle matrix has long been proposed.  In its simplest formulation a spindle matrix is hypothesized to provide a stationary or elastic molecular substrate that provides a backbone or strut for motor molecules to interact with during force generation and microtubule sliding.  Such a matrix could also have the added properties of helping to organize and stabilize the microtubule spindle.  Four nuclear proteins in Drosophila exhibiting properties consistent with a spindle matrix have been identified and will be cytologically and functionally analyzed to test the spindle matrix hypothesis.  State-of-the-art fluorescent imaging techniques will be used to determine these proteins' dynamic properties, newly generated mutants will be analyzed to gauge functional consequences of alteration or loss of these proteins, and potential interactions with microtubules and/or an essential motor protein will be probed to assess potential connections between the spindle matrix, the microtubule spindle, and motor proteins essential for mitotic spindle function.Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts from the project activities will accrue at several different levels.  1)  Advancing discovery with a potential to achieve paradigm-shifting results.  The demonstration of a spindle matrix will fundamentally alter the molecular understanding of spindle function.  Thus, this project has the potential to change textbook descriptions of mitosis.  2)  Incorporation of experimental aims into training projects at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels.  The PI has mentored 25 graduate students, 34 undergraduates and 4 high school students over the years with 8 undergraduates serving as coauthors on papers.  Among the undergraduates, 11 have entered graduate schools, 8 have pursued veterinary or medical training (2 in M.D./Ph.D. programs), and 2 have chosen scientific-related fields (forensics, lab technician).  This level of mentoring will be continued under the proposed project.  3)  Recruitment of underrepresented groups.  During her career, the PI has trained 35 women, including 6 African-Americans, and 1 African-American man.  4) Establishment of international partnerships.  As part of this project, a collaboration has been initiated with a group in Portugal that has obtained funding from FLAD to send a student to the PI's laboratory for training.  5)  Development of research-based educational materials.  The PI has been active in incorporating research methodology into her cell biology class in order to encourage problem-solving approaches.  She has developed a set of PowerPoint slides that are available to other Biol 314 instructors that is continually updated.  6)  Participation in mentoring programs.  The PI has participated as a faculty mentor in a number of different programs, including  Preparing Future Faculty  (advising graduate students on future academic/research careers),  Project Assist  (a program that recruits minority students to Iowa to work in a corporate research setting for academic credit), the  Honors Mentor Program  (a freshman lab orientation program for one-semester research projects for honors students), the BEST (Biology Education Success Teams) program (a living/learning program for orientation of incoming biology students), and Ames High School Partnerships for Biological Sciences program (to mentor high school students on research projects.)  The PI has also been very active in making presentations to undergraduate clubs (such as Tribeta, the honors biology club) and area undergraduate colleges on different topics, including her research work or on career prospects in research-related fields.  These mentoring activities will be continued\",\n",
       " 'PRISM Phase II is conducting research on strategies that lead to changes in the culture of science and mathematics education where dimensions of culture include policies, practices, partnerships, and resources.  Research studies in PRISM Phase II are producing further evidence of how and to what extent distinctive PRISM Phase I strategies - K-16 Professional Learning Communities, Culture of Higher Education and a Public Awareness Campaign - give rise to these four key elements of holistic cultural change.  The Phase II PRISM partnership is producing these outcomes through an integrated set of research studies focused on the following questions: 1) In what ways and to what extent do K-16 professional learning communities lead to partnerships which change professional practice of K-16 educators and improve student learning in K-16 science and mathematics? 2) To what extent do policy change and incentive structures that reward higher education faculty to collaborate with K-12 schools and to strengthen their own teaching result in sustainable changes in departmental and institutional culture, including changed policies, changed practices, new partnerships and dedicated resources, in higher education? 3) To what extent do schools that participate in the Public Awareness Campaign have greater student motivation, greater parental involvement and higher student achievement in science and mathematics than non-participating schools? PRISM Phase II expects to culminate in replicable models for implementing the three strategies in ways which elicit changes in culture and ultimately strengthen K-16 science and mathematics education.  Based upon the successes of PRISM Phase I, the University System of Georgia (USG) has launched a STEM Initiative, in FY 2009, designed to replicate the successes of PRISM throughout all 35 USG institutions.  Through STEM Initiative funding, 12 institutions will implement K-16 professional learning communities and faculty incentive programs for participation in the scholarship of teaching and learning with faculty from all USG institutions invited to participate in STEM-focused Faculty Institutes on the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics.  The implementation of STEM Initiative-supported learning communities provide a broad base of activity to support experimental studies, as well as avenues by which the results of the Phase II work also immediately inform the work of the STEM Initiative team.  This provides a direct avenue of dissemination of Phase II results to all public institutions of higher education in Georgia.  Phase II research findings are also being disseminated through presentations at national and regional conferences and through scholarly journals and proceedings',\n",

       " 'Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course',\n",

       " 'Recently, the 230Th constant-flux proxy (CFP) profiling method of calculating sediment accumulation rates (ARs) has become a topic of significant controversy, especially with respect to the issue of sediment focusing and its quantification.  Depending on whether one derives ARs using age models or CFPs leads to vastly different interpretations in paleoceanographic studies.   Under this award the PIs will investigate sediment redistribution processes to determine the veracity of the 230Th CFP.  They will measure another CFP with an independent source term, namely interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and the extraterrestrial 3He contained therein.  Agreement between 230Th and 3He variations in varied and well-studied depositional environments in the North Atlantic would constitute further support for the use of both CFPs for flux normalization. The data generated on sites with known amounts of sediment focusing and winnowing will help constrain the influence of abyssal currents on IDPs and the sediments carrying adsorbed 230Th, and will provide insights into the extent of hydrodynamic sorting of these particles. When combined with 14C and paired 3He and 230Th measurement on various separated fractions of the fine-grained component of the sediment, the PIs will test the hypotheses that 1) 3He is less sensitive than 230Th to sediment focusing, and 2) the degree to which sediment redistribution processes fractionate 3He-containing IDPs from the 230Th containing portion of the sediment. In the future, the proponents hope to develop a new proxy (3He/230Th ratio) for changes in the strength of deep-sea currents in association with past climatic changes.   This project will involve students in their teaching, training and learning',\n",
       " 'Passive seismic methods form the core of this 3-year, multi-disciplinary proposal designed to investigate temporal and spatial relationships between ice motion, basal processes and iceberg calving at a rapidly changing tidewater glacier. The proposed measurements will link glacier-generated seismic signatures to physical glaciological processes. At present, glacier generated waveforms are poorly understood. Understanding their source mechanisms could advance knowledge of the dynamic mass balance of Earth?s cryosphere, as well as improve models and understanding of glacier erosion and landscape evolution. Preliminary results from a 1-year pilot study highlight the tidewater glaciersof Icy Bay, Alaska as the regionally dominant source of glacier-generated seismic energy. Icy Bay is the optimal study site because of its highly dynamic glaciers, logistical simplicity and similarities with disintegrating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Pilot study results show potential to make use of long duration, high-resolution records of motion, seismicity and changes in geometry in concert to develop quantitative proxies for glacier erosion.The proposed work will record seismic events within a local network with densestation spacing, and simultaneously observe 3-D ice displacement and glacier geometry changes. Iceberg calving and basal processes are challenging to measure, and applying readily available and highly developed seismic methods to these problems holds significant promise. The proposal will support the collaboration of three early-career scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds.

       " 'Project TitleMCEER Hurricane Gustav Reconnaissance: Lessons Learned by New Orleans Hospitals from Katrina to Gustav and BeyondAbstractThe proposed project investigates decision making under uncertain conditions by examining the response of acute care hospitals in the New Orleans area before, during, and immediately after Hurricane Gustav including the evacuation and return of hospital patients and staff. ?Quick response? methodology will be used to gather information via observation of behaviors and facilities, document acquisition and evaluation, and semi-structured, face-to-face interviews of up to 30 hospital executives representing all 10 of the acute care hospitals in the New Orleans area. This qualitative approach is intended to provide a rich, context-aware understanding of the decision making by hospital executives in the New Orleans area with respect to emergency preparedness plans and execution. The project extends research conducted by the researchers after Hurricane Katrina and thus takes advantage of a natural experiment that allows the researchers to: (1) identify revisions to hospital emergency plans following Hurricane Katrina, (2) understand how revised emergency procedures were implemented during Hurricane Gustav, (3) assess outcomes of revised emergency procedures, and (4) make recommendations for improved hospital emergency procedures and healthcare planning in a region with recurrent and predictable natural disasters. The research thus examines whether Hurricane Katrina was a ?turning point? event for New Orleans area acute care hospitals. Organizations that fail to learn from disaster experiences are likely to repeat the mistakes that made them vulnerable. Lessons learned will be disseminated to a broad array of individuals and organizations through publications (e.g., MCEER Technical Report, peer-reviewed journal articles) and presentations (e.g., to the Academy of Management, to EERI, to regional and state agencies).Hospitals, along with power systems, water supply, and critical infrastructure) are vital components of a community?s critical lifelines, and emergency planning and leadership decision-making should ensure that hospitals are able to respond to a disaster and not become victims of a disaster (like some New Orleans hospitals did during and after Hurricane Katrina). In considering the consequences of disasters for communities, hospitals merit special attention thanks to their complexity and occupancy characteristics and because of their critical role in lifeline maintenance before, during, and after extreme events. Lessons learned from emergency planning and operations for hospitals for Hurricane Gustav will be broadened so that they are useful not only for hurricanes but for a variety of extreme events and not just for hospitals but for other institutions and organizations as well. Any organization that depends on the external environment for essential inputs (e.g., human resources, energy, supplies) to routine operations risks disruptions to those operations if sound emergency planning does not plan for resiliency. Learning from the experiences of hospital administrators and emergency officials who led organizations during extreme events should enable future organizations to be more resilient when facing various crises',\n",

Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services',\n",

       " '0824978ZachosThis proposal seeks funding for a new gas source dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Kiel carbonate device. Requested is a Thermo MAT 253 with a Kiel IV prep device. The system will be capable of routine carbon and oxygen isotope analyses from carbonates with high precision and low sample size (~5 µg C). The acquisition will allow the use of individual acid reaction vessels, increasing precision and minimizing sample sizes. The instrument will add to existing analysis capability. General research themes outlined for the new instrumentation fall into the areas of paleoclimatology, paleoceanography and paleoecology. One focus is understanding the biogeochemistry and climate evolution of the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic ?greenhouse? worlds; the causes and evolution of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The PI intends to measure shell carbonates spanning the PETM in the fossil record. Shell analysis obviates artifacts due to sediment reworking or bioturbation, but requires low sample volumes. A related project will look at the coupling of biogeochemical cycling, including nutrients, and climatic forcings during the PETM. The instrument will also be applied to understanding paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental forcings on the ecology, evolution of extant and ancient vertebrates (extinct). In addition, foraminiferal isotope analysis will be used to reconstruct paleoclimates associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

       " 'Groundwater flow systems within the Great Basin, Nevada are remarkable in many respects. Despite the arid conditions and relatively low permeability volcanic rocks and basin fill, this region hosts active geothermal systems and world class Eocene age gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems share many common features including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures ( >200 °C) at shallow depths (200-1500 m). Many of the Great Basin geothermal systems exhibit some of the highest shallow crustal heat flow levels ever recorded ( > 2000 mW/m2 at Beowawe) within the continental crust. Geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Beowawe geothermal system suggests that fluid circulation is deep (> 5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small ä18O (The goal of this proposal is to understand the three-dimensional plumbing, fluid flow impelling mechanisms, and temporal evolution of modern and fossil hydrothermal flow systems within the Great Basin. We wish to evaluate two end member questions regarding the nature of hydrothermal circulation within the Great Basin: A) Is flow restricted to high permeability fault planes driven by free-convection? or B) is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Because of the lack of broad low heat flow anomalies adjacent to Great Basin geothermal fields, we suspect that these flow systems must be episodic in nature due to permeability reduction associated with silica mineralization. By including the systematics of silica precipitation (and associated porosity/permeability reduction), we hope to constrain the duration of these geothermal systems. We will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin. We will develop geologically/geophysically constrained, three-dimensional hydrothermal models of the modern Beowawe and fossil Carlin geothermal systems; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and stratigraphy. A unique feature of the proposed work is that we will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to test our models. We will also develop more sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models using PFLOTRAN incorporating porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions to constrain how long the Carlin flow systems remained active before becoming clogged by gangue mineralization. By dating organic matter (pollen) within the hot springs deposits at Beowawe using 14C dating methods, we hope to determine whether or not these hot springs deposits formed during a single event or in several episodes.Our study may help document the existence of time-dependent natural convection systems within the Great Basin. Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of fluid circulation within this region is of great societal relevance because this region may soon host our nation?s high level nuclear wastes.

       " 'Data-intensive science requires tera- and peta-scale computing. Hardware demands are high, and software, from system to application level, is highly specialized. As a result, scientific investigation is constrained. New and more accessible models for large-scale computing are required. The proposed program seeks to leverage new off-the-shelf computing technologies to develop concepts and tools (e.g., programming strategies, general-purpose and domain-specific libraries) to enable practical and transparent Scalable Heterogeneous Computing (SHC). Results will be applied to three cutting-edge challenges in radio astronomy, quantum chemistry, and neuroscience. These three applications share the need to process massive data streams. They broadly span a parameter space of processing challenges, defined by complexity in computation, data volume, and throughput. Addressing these requires scalable algorithms for massive datasets, systems with high-bandwidth memory access, and the ability to process high-throughput data streams.    Proposed SHC strategies, tools, and optimizations would develop, for general scientific computing, use of massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) and fast, low-power, large-volume, solid-state storage (SSS) devices that are commercially available. The tools developed will be applied to the analysis of radioastronomy data generated by the Muchison Wide-Field Array, the development of a SHC-enabled molecular quantum chemistry code, and to the Connectome project, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity of mammalian brains. Education is tightly integrated into the SHC program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Initiatives to disseminate results will include tutorials and documented open-source libraries as well as workshops.LAY ABSTRACTScientists engaged in data-intensive research, from astronomy to neuroscience, are in desperate need of new strategies and tools.

Or, is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients  with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Are these systems fundamentally transient and self-sealing due to gaunge mineralization, or , is permeability enhanced by  carbonate dissolution? To evaluate these problems we will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin.  We will utilize a new three-dimensional (3-D) geologic model of  the  modern Beowawe geothermal system and, with USGS colleagues, develop another 3-D geologic model of the Eocene  Carlin system; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and  stratigraphy. This mesh generation software will allow us to honor low grid aspect ratios (required by the AZTEC parallel solver package)  as the grid transitions from strata to faults while allowing sufficient refinement to minimize numerical grid dispersion when solving the heat and mass transport equations.  We will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to constrain our models. At Beowawe, by dating pollen in the sinter terrace and adualria in exposed veins nearby we can get a sense of the timing of episodic discharges of hot fluid up the faults and on the duration of such discharges recorded by the sinter deposits. More sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models will be developed using PFLOTRAN  to evaluate porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions and ?sealing gangue precipitation reactions in each system. Our models will be validated by comparing modern and fossil geochemical and thermal proxies . The project will support two graduate students at New Mexico Tech and University of Missouri at Columbia. Initial results will be presented to industry representatives from Beowawe power plant, Barrick and Newmont gold mines for their input and feedback to improve the final result. Results will be published at the Geological Society of Nevada 2010 symposium and scientific journals to reach local and international audiences',\n",

       " 'Studying the contributions of U.S. universities to the innovation process and National Income is important to understanding how our current economic status has been achieved and to how our international competitiveness may be maintained or increased. This project models a key component of the innovation system, particularly creation and deployment of knowledge and the flows of financial resources. The objectives of this work are to produce estimates of the contributions of various combinations of university resources, especially those of STEM units, to outcomes that represent intermediate steps in the innovation process and that contribute to NI and thus to U.S. competitiveness.The key insight of the project is that universities produce multiple outputs--for example supplies of highly skilled labor and new knowledge. The importance of this labor and technological development to the national economy has been well established in both classical and evolutionary economic theory.  In addition, universities serve as support institutions for firms and industries. Universities contribute to intermediate outcomes that stimulate innovation processes and fuel the national economy. The primary emphasis is to use data to develop new models explaining the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate (to National Income growth) university outcomes, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness and hence the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions.The project builds a relational meta data base that examines the relationships among resource deployment in U.S. universities and intermediate university outcomes related to innovation and economic growth. The data for the project are derived from a variety of sources at the institutional, departmental, and individual levels. Intermediate and final outcomes include wages paid, the production of graduates, patents, licenses, start-up and spin-off companies, consultancies, joint industry-university grants and contracts, job-training programs for firms? employees, and importantly, research papers. ?Inputs? related to these outcomes include various university resources: e.g., the human resources of university faculty, staff, and student workers; the time allocations of these individuals across teaching, research and service; and the allocation of the university?s own financial resources. BROADER IMPACTS: The benefits include advancing understanding of the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate university outcomes in STEM fields. These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness. Thus, the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions',\n",
       " \"The stable isotope chemistry of water is a powerful tool for probing the atmospheric water cycle and has been used to advance our understanding of water vapor dynamics around the globe. Until recently, measuring water vapor isotope ratios was a time-consuming and laborious process, but advances in spectroscopic techniques now allow automated, real-time, nearly continuous measurements of the 18O/16O and 2H/1H (or D/H) ratios in water vapor. In addition, advances in remote sensing of Earth's infrared emission spectrum at high resolution now allow the atmospheric deuterium abundance to be mapped globally. These new technologies are very promising for climate studies, but we do not fully understand the biases in these new measurements, nor do we know how measurements made with these new technologies compare with one another and with the more traditional and labor-intensive mass spectrometric techniques involving vacuum flask collection and cryogenic trapping. Before the full potential of the new spectroscopic methods for water vapor isotope measurements can be realized in climate research, a program of instrument validation and intercomparison must be performed. The PIs will make measurements of water vapor isotopologues at the NOAA observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii using three different laser-based sensors and two different satellites, which will be validated against traditional mass spectrometry techniques applied to samples collected on site. The goal of this study is to compare the different measurement techniques in order to assess of the fidelity of these new measurement technologies and to provide new data on the processes that control the humidity of the subtropical Pacific. This comprehensive set of measurements will be made from October 12-24, 2008, in conjunction with the AGU Chapman Conference  Atmospheric Water Vapor and its Role in Climate , which will be held in Kona, Hawaii. The opportunity for this project has emerged from recent discussions between the PIs and colleagues from industry, NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Service d'aéronomie in Paris. A number of important resources are being made available for this project at little or no cost to this grant. The timing seems to be fortuitous as several of the scientists involved are planning to be in Hawaii for the Chapman conference, and the other resources happen to be available at the same time. Intellectual Merit Measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues provide important information about the Earth?s hydrologic cycle, and new technologies promise to expand our understanding of the use and limitations of such measurements. The project will help to establish the foundation for climate studies using these new technologies by providing the first intercomparison between different ground and satellite-based techniques. The results of this study will be used to better understand optimal system configurations for climatological studies of water vapor isotopes and determine biases in emerging remote-sensing technologies. Moreover, the data from this project will help to constrain models of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle by providing the first continuous measurements of water isotopologues from an arid subtropical mid-ocean site. Broader Impacts The results of this intercomparison project will be important for the broader community of atmospheric water vapor isotope researchers as they begin to make use of the new array of remote sensing and laser-based techniques. The low humidity conditions atop Mauna Loa will test the limitations of the surface-based spectroscopic techniques and provide a sound footing for understanding the reliability of the instruments under extreme but climatologically important conditions. The results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at national conferences and will inform algorithm and instrument development in the United States and in Europe. The project will promote the training of graduate students by including them in the field program and data analysis. During the first week of the program, JPL scientists will make informal presentations to the students from University of New Mexico and Colorado University on water isotope measurement techniques and algorithms. During the second week of the program, the students will participate in the Chapman Conference, and the PIs will invite other graduate students attending the conference to join them in the field, either before the conference begins, or during the planned field excursion to the Mauna Loa Lab by conference attendees, which will also include a presentation about this project. In addition, this project will foster partnerships with industry (Picarro and Los Gatos) and with European colleagues associated with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer instrument\",\n",

The work proposed in this grant continues an exploration of the regulatory aspects of sulfur deprivation responses in the alga Chlamydomonas. Regulatory mutants aberrant for sulfur-deprivation responses and suppressor strains will be characterized to help identify interactions among signaling factors. Wild-type and various mutant strains will be queried with genome-wide methods for examining the transcriptome under nutrient-replete and sulfur-starvation conditions, using both microarray and Solexa sequencing technologies. Focused intellectual and technical efforts will be directed toward establishing more biochemical links between identified regulators. A diversity of protein-protein interaction assays, including the yeast two-hybrid system, the split ubiquitin and split GFP systems and the classical co-immunoprecipitation assays will facilitate these studies, providing strong insights into the regulatory circuits that control nutrient limitation responses in photosynthetic organisms. Finally, analyses will be performed to help understand the two tiers of the sulfur-deprivation response that have recently been discovered; one is protein synthesis-independent while the other is protein synthesis-dependent. In a broader sense, the proposed work will help untangle some of the complexities associated with the regulatory machinery that is required for photosynthetic cells to cope with deprivation conditions and ultimately help us understand the impact of sulfur compounds in our diets and on global weather patterns; some sulfur compounds strongly influence the quality and nutritional value of food while others have profound effects on the climate of the Earth. The project will train a post doctoral student and will involve collaboration with Dr. Charles Hauser and his undergraduate students at St. Edward's University, who will participate in summer exchange and in the analysis of microarray results.

       " \"Understanding the sensitivity of food systems to global change is limited by high uncertainties associated with the cross-scale interactions between the natural environment and the cultural landscape. Defining what might be within a suite of plausible futures requires a baseline scenario that captures the factors that are most significant in shaping decisions at different levels of governance, and which highlights the current, changing and interacting sensitivities of the system to stressors associated with both climate change and economic and cultural globalization. This project will create such a baseline by assessing the drivers and evolving social outcomes of one of the world's most important food systems: the Mexican maize system. Building on prior research that anticipates climate change will have negative impacts for Mexican maize production, and the globalization of agricultural markets is further challenging the future of maize in Mexico, an interdisciplinary team of social and biophysical scientists will investigate Mexican agricultural vulnerability in terms of a complex food system, in which individual decisions to plant or not to plant maize are hypothesized to manifest as landscape scale transformations. The research team also expects that global to regional price signals and climatic variability will affect local food production and land use outcomes differently across the Mexican landscape, as a function of regionally-specific cultural, economic, demographic, ecological and political factors. The project involves: a) a description of the changing national geography of maize production and the associated socioeconomic, institutional, and demographic correlates; b) an analysis of climate trends and variability as related to maize production, yields and water availability for irrigated farming; c) an econometric analysis of the spatial patterns of maize price volatility in three maize-producing states in order to evaluate the contribution of maize price volatility to farm-level risk and d) an evaluation of the drivers (e.g., prices and climate) and outcomes (land use, perceptions of food quality, and household maize expenditures) of maize abandonment / persistence at the farm-level through case studies in the states of Sinaloa, Mexico and Chiapas. A combination of approaches will be used, including exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), econometrics analysis (spatial, time-series, and spatial panels), agro-climatic analyses, and household livelihood surveys.This interdisciplinary and multi-method project involves experts in economic geography, econometrics, spatial analysis, livelihood assessment, climatology, agroecology and public policy in Mexico and the United States. It will provide the foundation for subsequent research on the development of scenarios of future social-ecological change and vulnerability of food security in Mexico. The project consolidates a strong international collaborative research community, involving Arizona State University, University of California Santa Barbara, the Colegio de Mexico (Mexico City), the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Chiapas), and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP, Mexico City). The project aims to enhance this network throughout the project's implementation, by inviting Mexican experts external to the project to participate in part of the annual project coordination meetings to share their research and insights. Graduate students from the U.S. institutions will collaborate with research counterparts in Mexico. The approaches and findings from the project will be used as case material for graduate and undergraduate courses in earth system science, regional analysis, development economics and sustainable food systems. The diagnostic and analytical results of this project will be disseminated through a variety of forums to maize policy experts of the national agricultural secretary (SAGARPA), state agriculture ministries in Sinaloa, State of Mexico and Chiapas, non-governmental organizations interested in land use change and maize diversity, and to the academic communities in Mexico and the U.S. The project's results will also be disseminated to Mexican authorities responsible for climate change initiatives nationally in order to contribute to the efforts of these agencies to comply with international climate change agendas\",\n",

This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula (AP). By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums.

       " \"This project will support the postdoctoral research of Ofer Cohen at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  Dr. Cohen will investigate the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the long-term evolution of the solar magnetic field and the solar cycle.  Since the detailed mechanism causing solar open field reversal is unknown, the Principal Investigator (PI) will numerically test the hypothesis that interchange reconnection of CMEs with the ambient open magnetic flux can lead to the destruction of coronal holes and the reversal of the Sun's open magnetic field.  Using MHD simulations, Dr. Cohen and his team will investigate how magnetic flux emerges through the solar surface and then is transferred by CMEs to reconnect with, and to modify, the background magnetic field. The long-term evolution of the solar magnetic field and the solar cycle are important for predicting space weather.  Understanding the behavior of CMEs and their propagation is also required in order to develop predictive tools. The PI anticipates that this research on CMEs will shed light on the long-term effect of CMEs on the solar magnetic field and on the effect of the ambient field on CME propagation.

The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas.  This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college.  The project will address two key research questions: 1. Who enrolls in accelerated academic programs?  What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? 2. Do accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)?  Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others?  Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?The proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools.  Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools.

       " 'Human civilizations have developed during the Holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. The Holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. However, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the Holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history.Although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of Holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. Holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. Glaciers in many areas on Earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the Holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. The age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental Holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking.Recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the Holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of Holocene climate changes. This grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the Holocene moraine sequences in New Zealand?s Southern Alps by applying high-precision 10Be surface exposure dating (SED) combined with local calibration of the 10Be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. New Zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different Holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the Holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?Little Ice Age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our SED approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of New Zealand?s Southern Alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on Earth. To achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the Southern Alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. We will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from New Zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the Holocene glacial pulse-beat. One of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?Little Ice Age, where detailed historical records are available for European glaciers.Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: We expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of Holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: Were Holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric? Were atmospheric circulation changes involved in driving these events or were both, global and regional forces involved? This project represents a unique opportunity to create a reference data set of Holocene glacial fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes. These data should be of high value to calibrate climate models and to the broad community of climate scientists and glacial geologists. We further develop the method of cosmogenic 10Be dating and our geochemical/geochronological tool-kit will be applicable to future Holocene moraine-dating projects. The new atlas of geomorphic maps of the central Southern Alps will be updated with our glacial chronologies during this project.In addition to extending the LDEO/CU curriculum, a female master student will be educated, several early-career scientists will be involved, and high school students and teachers (?Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program?) will actively participate in this project. Beyond standard data dissemination, we will present the project at public events, such as the annual L-DEO Open House (typically 4,000 visitors) and will use our close contacts to New York public media to seek coverage of this project in newspapers (New York Times) and television (History Channel).

A newborn wildebeest calf walks with the herd within a few hours of birth. A frog or a turtle, using just its spinal cord, can control complex goal-directed trajectories. The spinal cord can also rapidly correct such movements if they are perturbed. It has been argued that these remarkable capacities are modular, constructed with small sets of primitives or motor building blocks. How such primitives arise and are used is the focus of this project.The concepts of modularity and motor primitives have provided useful descriptions of the organization of spinal motor systems. Modular organization has been shown to support spinal behaviors, and may help to  bootstrap  motor learning. Nonetheless, modularity is controversial at many levels. Spinal primitives might need to be supplanted or augmented in order to perform complex, voluntary behaviors. This project attacks this problem in frog prey strike behaviors, a voluntary and adapted behavior in a system that is fundamentally important to the animal, and has also been well characterized in previous studies of modularity.  The neuromechanics of prey strike is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The importance of modular organization in neuroscience and behavior extends well beyond biological motor control, with ramifications in evolutionary and cognitive psychology. Biological strategies and solutions are also highly relevant to future technologies and robotics.A computer model of prey strike will be developed using a novel approach based on Cosserat strand-elements. The model will be developed by a team of four investigators: Simon Giszter (neurophysiology) and Jonathan Nissanov (anatomy, imaging) at Drexel University, Dinesh Pai (computer science, biomechanical modeling) at the University of British Columbia, and Kiisa Nishikawa  (neuromechanics) at Northern Arizona University. Cryoplane microscopy will be used to reconstruct bullfrog sensorimotor anatomy in detail. These structures will be modeled using a strand-based approach to incorporate this detail.  Experimental and model analyses of prey strike using these data will inform one another to establish the benefits and limits of fixed or adaptive modular mechanisms, and the biological implementation used in frogs\",\n",
       " 'This CAREER project will build an education and research program in methodology for process monitoring, fault identification, and fault diagnosis using high-dimensional functional data or image sensor signals.  Due to the massive amount and high dimensionality of image and functional data, the analysis and manipulation required to obtain timely synthesized information for quality improvement becomes complicated and resource intensive. The proposed methods will integrate wavelet-based signal-processing techniques and system-modeling procedures oriented to data mining to develop an in-process (or in-situ) control tool for manufacturing processes. The proposed methodology includes the following:  (1) an adaptive multi-scale monitoring model for functional data or image sensor signals to overcome the problem of the low fault detection probability present in existing techniques; (2) a kernel-based fault identification index measure and a variable selection algorithm to identify contributing process variables to improve diagnostic performance; (3) a nonlinear fault diagnosis model to determine an assignable cause for a fault and to effectively handle ill-posed autocorrelated functional data or image sensor signals.The results of this research will provide manufacturers with new tools for handling high-dimensional functional data or image sensor signals for quality improvement of their manufacturing processes. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it is generic and can be adapted to other research and application areas, such as in the monitoring of nonlinear profiles, the problem of large-scale sensor failure detection, and variable selection problems of spectrum data, or in the development of new research issues related to nonlinear multivariate SPC in bioprocesses, semiconductor and automobile manufacturing, and other manufacturing processes',\n",

       " 'Computer security is a field in which defenses are pitted against adversaries.  Thus, it is critical to understand the capabilities and motivations of the adversary if one is to plan effective defenses.  However, modern Internet-based attacks are largely driven by economic factors that are only understood in the abstract.  While we know that it is sufficiently cheap to compromise Internet hosts that large-scale botnets have become a compelling platform for launching attacks, we simply do not understand the scale of the revenue that that such activities bring in.  While we understand that billions of spam e-mails are sent per day, the conversion rate of this spam ? the probability that a sent message will result in a ?sale? ? is largely unknown.  Absent such information it is difficult to reason about the structural nature of the conflict between attackers and defenders.Traditionally, obtaining information about the critical economic factors in Internet attacks is difficult because such information is only visible to the attacker themselves.  Our research is focused on sidestepping this issue by infiltrating the technical infrastructure ? the botnets themselves ? used by Internet miscreants.  Our technique, called ?distribution infiltration? provides a means to directly quantify key aspects of spam and phishing campaigns as well as to measure the impact of defenses on an economic footing (i.e., their impact on the profitability of e-crime).  Our research will both refine these methodologies and produce concrete data for developing economic-based threat models of computer security',\n",

       " 'This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the transport and fate of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in watersheds. We address three novel questions which have not been studied previously: (a) what is the relative influence of terrestrial versus aquatic (in-stream) sources/sinks on DON and bioavailable (BDON) dynamics at various points along the drainage path? (b) how do DON and BDON exports vary with catchment scale? and (c) how do DON dynamics differ from DOC and what mechanisms are responsible for these differences? We address these questions across varying temporal scales from baseflow to storm events and across seasons. Contributions of DON from various catchment sources are expected to change dramatically between baseflow and storm-event conditions while seasonal changes can especially influence BDON. Catchment sources investigated include ? precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, forest floor, hillslope soil water, wetland soil and ground water, groundwater seeps, hyporheic zone, and streamflow. We will not only investigate how the amounts of DON in various catchment sources influence DON export, but also investigate how the mobility (adsorption-desorption kinetics) and lability of various dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents (e.g., hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions) regulate DON export. Special attention is given to differences in DON and DOC responses in light of hydrologic flow paths, storm event magnitude and seasonal timing, antecedent catchment wetness, and redox conditions. We address these questions across zero- to third-order forested catchments of the Big Elk Creek in NE Maryland, which are representative of Piedmont catchments in the mid-Atlantic region. The catchments have already been intensively instrumented, and preliminary data from the site is available since March 2007. We will implement end member mixing analysis (EMMA) at multiple points in the catchments to characterize the spatial pattern of runoff sources and DON contributions. Innovative, new, spectrofluorometric tools such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) are used to characterize DOM composition including an in-situ logging fluorometer. A strong interdisciplinary team of scientists with diverse strengths but complimentary interests will evaluate the questions. We anticipate that this study will result in the first conceptual model of DON that characterizes the relative influences of terrestrial and instream processes across various catchment scales.Results from this study will have direct practical implications for: (a) drinking water research since DON contributes to the formation of toxic disinfection by-products; and (b) nutrient enrichment of coastal estuaries (e.g., Chesapeake bay) since DON is bioavailable. An on-line data archive will be created to disseminate the data and results from this study. This data archive will be linked through the web site of the Center for Critical Zone (CCZ) at the University of Delaware and the Delaware Water Resources Center (DWRC). Dissemination of fact sheets to practitioners in regional offices of the US Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Forest Service, US EPA, and Maryland?s Forest Service should broaden the impact of the proposed research.

       " 'The goal of the proposed work is to provide an improved understanding of snow depth ? climate relationships and the physical mechanisms involved. An extensive body of scientific literature describes the linkages between snow extent anomalies and climate, but snow extent alone does not tell the whole story. Variations in snow depth, which do not necessarily coincide with variations in snow extent, may have a distinct and considerable impact on climate over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recently completed research by the PI clearly distinguishes the climatic significance of snow depth, and complements the somewhat limited existing literature on snow depth ? climate linkages. This serves as motivation for this proposal to identify the responsible mechanisms.The snow depth - climate relationship is likely to be very complicated, and involve different dynamic and thermodynamic processes across varying spatial domains and scales. Some facets of this overall relationship are better understood than others, while still other facets may benefit from updated analyses using more recent data and/or modeling resources. Therefore the proposed work will specifically target two aspects of the overall snow depth ? climate relationship where our current state of understanding is incomplete. Two hypotheses are investigated, the first involving a remote climatic cause for snow depth variability over North America, and the second involving a local climatic consequence of snow depth variability.A key resource for this proposal is a newly released, long-term, gridded, daily snow depth dataset covering all of North America (Dyer and Mote 2006). Its availability offers exciting new opportunities to study snow depth and its interactions with climate, especially in northern regions of North America where snow depth information has historically been lacking but is expected to vary considerably. Hence this frequently neglected parameter can be empirically evaluated over a broader domain than previously was possible. Furthermore, snow depth perturbation experiments will be performed using both a one-dimensional snowpack model and a regional climate model, to comprehensively evaluate the thermodynamic and near-surface dynamic processes associated with anomalous snow depth.Diagnosing specific climatic causes and consequences of snow depth variability, rather than an exploratory and unfocused study of the overall relationships, hold the strongest prospects for success and impact within the hydrologic and climate science communities. Recognition of snow depth as an important contributor to climate variations will promote continued improvements in the still relatively crude snow parameterizations in climate models, and also in snow depth remote sensing techniques. The concept of distinct snow depth and snow extent linkages will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of snow ? climate relationships, and provide new information to help identify additional regions/seasons which may hold some predictive capability for climate. This in turn would have far-reaching societal benefits for water resource management, hazard mitigation and anthropogenic climate change.The proposed research will be managed to maximize its broader impacts on education. Despite its focused scope and relatively modest budget, the project will support three students at dramatically different stages of their educational career. An existing doctoral candidate at the PI?s institution will complete her dissertation, and ensure a smooth and efficient transition to a new doctoral student for the duration of this project. Furthermore, one high school student at New York City?s prestigious Bronx High School of Science will be sponsored, whose research on this project will be entered in the Intel Science Talent Search competition (http://www.sciserv.org/Sts/).

       " 'Human civilizations have developed during the Holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. The Holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. However, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the Holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history. Although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of Holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. Holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. Glaciers in many areas on Earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the Holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. The age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental Holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking. Recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the Holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of Holocene climate changes. This grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the Holocene moraine sequences in New Zealand?s Southern Alps by applying high-precision 10Be surface exposure dating (SED) combined with local calibration of the 10Be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. New Zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different Holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the Holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?Little Ice Age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our SED approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of New Zealand?s Southern Alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on Earth. To achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the Southern Alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. We will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from New Zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the Holocene glacial pulse-beat. One of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?Little Ice Age, where detailed historical records are available for European glaciers. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: We expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of Holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: Were Holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric? Were atmospheric circulation changes involved in driving these events or were both, global and regional forces involved? This project represents a unique opportunity to create a reference data set of Holocene glacial fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes. These data should be of high value to calibrate climate models and to the broad community of climate scientists and glacial geologists. We further develop the method of cosmogenic 10Be dating and our geochemical/geochronological tool-kit will be applicable to future Holocene moraine-dating projects. The new atlas of geomorphic maps of the central Southern Alps will be updated with our glacial chronologies during this project. In addition to extending the LDEO/CU curriculum, a female master student will be educated, several early-career scientists will be involved, and high school students and teachers (?Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program?) will actively participate in this project. Beyond standard data dissemination, we will present the project at public events, such as the annual L-DEO Open House (typically 4,000 visitors) and will use our close contacts to New York public media to seek coverage of this project in newspapers (New York Times) and television (History Channel).

       " 'An award has been made to Harvard University under the direction of Dr. Anne Pringle to study the symbiosis of fungi and woody plants.  The grant will improve the doctoral dissertation research of Benjamin Wolfe.  Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations on the surface of woody plant roots.  This symbiosis benefits the plant by enhancing water and mineral absorption, and it provides the fungi with a source of nutrients from the plant.  These symbioses have evolved multiple times throughout the mushroom forming fungi.  However, ecological and genomic changes in the fungi in these symbioses remain poorly understood.  This work will use the genus Amanita, a genus that includes many toxic species and includes both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic species of fungi.  A molecular phylogeny of 200 Amanita species will be constructed to determine the number of times symbiosis has evolved in Amanita.  To examine how the evolution of symbiosis affects resource acquisition, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen will be measured for Amanita species.  The structure of functional genes and estimates of genome size will be used to assess genomic changes associated with the evolution of symbiosis. This project will provide insight on the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, an economically and ecologically important symbiosis in forest ecosystems.

       " \"An important kind of virtual research organization is the project-based research collaboration involving researchers from different institutions. The project provides a scientific grounding for managing, evaluating, and predicting success in distributed research collaborations. Collaborative success depends on whether investigators have a productive climate: a social and technical context that supports performance and innovation. In a productive climate, collaborators perceive they have resources to collaborate effectively; they see a link between their achievements and rewards they receive; they experience their group as flexible and welcoming of innovative approaches; and they note minimal conflict between the collaboration and their career and their institution's values. The research defines and measures a productive climate of distributed research collaborations and focuses on a key antecedent of a productive climate: the institutional environment of the collaboration. One example of this kind of environment is whether the institutions that employ the investigators see exceptional value in interdisciplinary research and have developed practices that support this kind of research.The investigators study the institutional environments of a sample of projects that were supported by the National Science Foundation. The intellectual contribution of this work includes documenting the importance of a productive climate for distributed research collaboration, and tracing the linkages among productive climate and the institutional environments of these collaborations. This analysis led to better metrics for measuring and predicting performance and innovation in collaborations. Identifying the institutional factors that predict the productive climate and outcomes of research collaborations also permit the development of models to predict which collaborations are likely to be successful. The broader impacts of this project are to inform university, agency, and regulatory practices and policies for science and new forms of interdisciplinary, distributed research collaboration\",\n",
       " 'Intellectual Merit This project builds on exciting new findings from current work at Tufts University under an NSF/NIRT grant, in which we have collected significant evidence pointing to atomic dispersions of gold and platinum in ceria, and gold in iron oxide, as the catalytic sites for the water gas shift reaction (WGS). We followed activity loss with gold cluster growth in ceria matrices and identified conditions that stabilize gold growth. We have shown that addition of small amounts of oxygen can be used to stabilize Au- or Pt-CeO2 shift catalysts at all temperatures and in cyclic start up/ shutdown operation in realistic fuel gas streams. We have further demonstrated a strong shape/crystal face/strain effect of ceria on the WGS activity of Au/ceria by using single ceria crystals at the nanoscale prepared by controlled hydrothermal synthesis, which can be tested at normal pressures in flow reactor systems. Moreover, this project builds on new, important theoretical findings from the University of Wisconsin that certain pairs of metals examined as surface or near surface alloys possess much improved activity as PEM cathode electrocatalysts. The unique capability in high-resolution STM/STS of one of the Tufts co-PIs will open a new avenue of investigation that connects atomic-level composition and electronic properties with the surface chemistry of these model catalysts. In the proposed work, we will extend the study of atomic dispersions of metals to other oxides, such as zirconia and zinc oxide, both prepared by novel synthesis routes as nano rods, cubes, polyhedra, etc. exposing specific crystal planes on which to deposit and study metals and metal alloys. The WGS and methanol steam reforming (MSR) processes will be the reactions of interest to probe structure sensitivity with the support. Metals and near surface metal alloys from the group of Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt, will be examined. A new combinatorial approach to rank order alloy metal reactivity is proposed, whereby nanoalloy tips pressed on thin oxides-on-thermocouple junctions will be constructed in arrays and thermoelectric response will be used to monitor adsorption/reaction on the nanoalloys. A rational approach to the synthesis and evaluation of novel catalysts for WGS and MSR is proposed to complement and guide the catalysis work. Thus, STM/STS studies and computational chemistry are center-stage in the project. We will also make use of the XAS capabilities at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) through our collaborators there. Our overall goal in the project is to elucidate the metal-oxide and the metal-metal interactions responsible for redox reactions of interest to fuel reforming for hydrogen generation and pave the way for the design of the next generation of WGS and MSR catalysts. Broader Impacts We propose to undertake a systematic, multidisciplinary research effort to investigate the atomic-level interaction of Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd with ceria, zirconia, or zinc oxide for two reactions of interest to the production of hydrogen for fuel cells; namely, the water-gas shift and methanol steam reforming reactions. Knowledge garnered from these systems has both mechanistic and practical implications for other closely related reactions of importance to clean energy, including the processing of other oxygenates derived from fossil fuels or biomass. An interdisciplinary team of experts from Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at Tufts, Chemical Engineering at the Wisconsin, and Chemistry at BNL, has been assembled for this project. At the end of the interdisciplinary effort, we will have answered key questions on the activity and selectivity of atomically dispersed metals, metal clusters, and supported surface alloys on nanoparticles of ceria, zirconia, or zinc oxide, and be in a position to provide rational designs for practical catalyst preparation. These materials will be used in fuel and biofuel processing, and as anode catalysts and films for fuel cell applications. Thus, the impact of these findings will lead to better power systems design. There are several other tangible benefits for each of the disciplines involved here: new methods for catalyst synthesis, new materials properties specific to the nanoscale of importance to sensors, fuel cell components, and to catalysts; and new catalyst designs for low-cost fuels and chemicals production. An overall benefit will be a template for the rational design of catalysts derived from the interdisciplinary activities of the project. In what has become a tradition in our laboratories, we regularly exchange information with industrial colleagues. In this project, we plan to involve industrial colleagues as technical advisors, both for science and possibly for technology transfer. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal clearly impacts the education of graduate students and postgraduate fellows. Extensive training of young researchers at BNL is also planned in the project. A significant number of women students will be involved in the project, and the Tufts Summer Scholars program for undergraduates will be used to recruit other under represented groups.

       " \"This project will identify ways to reduce wildfire hazard and the loss of imperiled ecosystems by exploring the joint effects of climate and land use changes in western Oregon's Willamette Valley Ecoregion.  Three hypotheses will be tested: climate change will increase fuel loads and wildfire hazard; land development will increase the area of wildland-urban interface and alter vegetation in ways that increase the risk of wildfire and loss of imperiled ecosystems; and some management options will be more robust than others in mitigating fire risk and sustaining imperiled ecosystems across a range of future climate scenarios.  The work will employ a biophysical model that downscales from the coarse spatial scales of current climate change models to the fine spatial scales at which human land use and management decisions are made, and then scales back up to represent the landscape-scale effects of human actions on vegetation and fire hazard.  The biophysical model will be coupled with an agent-based model in which decision makers on individual land parcels respond to climate, land use regulation and incentives, land markets, perceived fire hazard, land management costs, and aesthetics.  This research will advance knowledge of how to bridge key theoretical and practical issues related to multiple types of system uncertainties, different spatial and temporal scales, and complex interactions and feedbacks among coupled natural and human systems.  The risk of catastrophic wildfire in the wildland-urban interface is a growing nationwide threat that projected climate change is likely to exacerbate.  This project supports emerging national, regional and local initiatives by providing tools to forecast risks and mitigate the impacts.  Global climate change models have become increasingly mechanistic, sophisticated and spatially explicit.  However, the development of interactive models of how biological and human cultural systems will respond to climate change at the spatial scales at which land use and management decisions are made is in its infancy.  This research will produce a transferable methodology for modeling such systems that is tractable, spatially explicit, and directly linked to policy-based decision-making.  The development of solutions that are robust to future uncertainties is an important approach toward adaptively managing complex systems that include strongly coupled ecological and socio-economic processes.  The project engages graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at two universities. It also involves students with stakeholder groups in workshops designed to support policy makers and the public in making more informed decisions that address the challenges of climate change\",\n",
       " 'Preliminary analysis of the storms preceding the recent Eastern Iowa floods have revealed that there was no single, extreme storm that was responsible for the flood conditions. Instead, the effect of a sequence of storms compounded, affecting locations along the larger rivers in the basin. We propose to investigate: (1) the link between the characteristics of the storms (or group of storms) that caused the floods along the Iowa River; (2) how storm properties are related to flooding as a function of basin scale, following insights from a new geophysical theory of floods; and (3) whether the methodologies developed here can be extended to other large basins using the Hydro?]NEXRAD radar?]rainfall dataset.The urgency of our proposal lies in the pressing need to understand the causes and far?]reaching effects of the 2008 Iowa flood. Undoubtedly, local authorities and communities will be looking to our research facility, IIHR?]Hydroscience and Engineering at The University of Iowa, to analyze the flooding events and offer guidance in adopting measures to prevent or mitigate the effect of future floods. While this proposal addresses a very recent, ongoing natural disaster, it is grounded in our collective, sustained work on the geophysical theory of floods.Intellectual Merit: Over the past 20 years, scientists at the University of Colorado, The University of Iowa, and other institutions have collaborated on a new theory of floods. Recent advances in this theory have revealed the important role played by the self?]similar structure of the river network in determining the magnitude of peak flows. In particular, flow aggregation patterns imposed by the presence of the river network provide explicit guidelines to understand the genesis of extreme flooding events similar to the ones in Eastern Iowa in June 2008. This framework allows rapid and physically meaningful analysis of flood events across a range of spatial scales, without the need to resort to rainfall?]runoff model calibration.Broader Impacts: This work could potentially change the concept of Probable Maximum Precipitation and Probable Maximum Flood and their use in engineering design. The analysis will also offer significant insight into our globally changing climate',\n",
       " 'Intellectual Merit:Because all aspects of biodiversity ultimately derive from DNA-level resources, a mechanistic theory of evolution must start at the genomic level. This work focuses on the hypothesis that many aspects of genome evolution are driven by nonadaptive forces (random genetic drift, mutation, and recombination) rather than natural selection responding to external ecological forces. Using mathematical/computational analysis, the research will exploit the enormous set of resources available from whole-genome sequencing projects, from viruses to organelles to bacteria and multicellular species. Because evolution is a population-level process, priority will be on developing a general theory for genomic evolution consistent with well-established principles of population genetics, while spanning the fields of computational biology and informatics, molecular and cellular biology, and systems biology.The overall goal is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics. Under the proposed hypothesis, many of the complex genomic features that are the hallmark of multicellular species emerged largely as a consequence of a substantial reduction in the efficiency of selection, whereas the streamlined genomes of microbial species result from highly efficient selection opposing the accumulation of mutationally hazardous excess DNA. At the very least, the theory to be developed provides a null (nonadaptive) hypothesis for interpreting the evolution of genome complexity. Broader Impact: Through the integration of these various subprojects, the overall goal of the proposed research is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics, as well as to help develop the intellectual infrastructure that will ultimately be necessary for the emergence of a field of evolutionary cell biology. In addition, the research project will be intertwined with a set of educational goals, including: 1) the establishment of an annual set of projects associated with a genome evolution class that services students from both the life sciences and informatics; 2) the recruitment of mathematically inclined biology undergraduates into a two- to three-year research program; and 3) the development of an integrative ?training-grant?-like environment among the grant participants',\n",

The context of inquiry for this project will be the six communities currently being evaluated by the Department of Homeland Security to host the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF). The design incorporates public opinion survey methodology, in-depth interviews with stakeholders and media content analysis. This multi-faceted design will provide insights into both successful and failed communication strategies aimed at engaging local residents, and help the research team develop a better understanding of how public deliberation can help or undermine efforts to meaningfully connect with various publics on risk-related issues. The research will contribute to understanding the social amplification an attenuation of risk. In particular, the PI is interested in two levels of outcome variables. At a first level, the PI will explore how the interplay of media coverage, interpersonal channels, and predispositional factors shape feelings of trust toward various stakeholders, including executive and regulatory bodies at the state and federal level, local agencies and governments, and other regional players. This first outcome variable is likely to directly shape a second-level outcome variable that this project examines through comparative analysis of multiple communities: public perceptions of risks and their dynamic nature over time',\n",
       " \"The surge in the introduction of new products coupled with the significant reduction in time from product design to manufacturing, as well as the ever increasing customer's expectation for high reliability and longer warranties have prompted industry to shorten its product test duration.  In many cases, the testing of the products prototypes can take months and even years before actual production takes place.  In many situations, accelerated life testing which subjects the product samples to extreme conditions might be the only viable approach to assess whether the product meets the expected long term reliability requirements.  As a result, the accuracy of reliability estimates from such testing has a profound effect on the subsequent decisions regarding system configuration, warranties and preventive maintenance schedules.  Inappropriate implementation of the test might cause delays in product release, termination of the entire product or catastrophic failures in the actual use of the product.  In a variety of industrial applications, there could be many choices in stress loadings when conducting testing.  Each stress loading has some advantages and drawbacks.  This has raised many practical questions regarding the equivalence among various accelerating test plans involving different stress loadings.  The problem becomes more difficult when multiple stresses are involved.  To overcome these challenges, we propose to investigate and contribute fundamental and theoretical models and provide several statistical tools to facilitate practical reliability tests. New framework for planning accelerated testing under various stress loadings, especially under complex stress and multiple stresses conditions, will be established. If successful, the research results will fill a major gap in reliability assessment needed by industry.  Especially, the results will enable industry to design efficient and economical test plans, yet the results of the test will provide accurate reliability estimates.  The tools to be developed will facilitate and further promote the implementation of accelerated life testing in modern industry\",\n",
       " 'This award will provide support for part of a major facility upgrade to benefit geochemical research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Specifically, funds will be allocated over 3 years for acquisition of (1) a new generation noble gas mass spectrometer and inlet system, (2) a high sensitivity single collector (SC) ICP-MS, and (3) a high precision multi-collector (MC) ICP-MS.  The timing of this award is motivated by a combination of increasing demand at LDEO and AMNH for access to this type of instrumentation at a time when the performance of aging existing facilities is inadequate to pursue state of the art research, coupled with major new commitments by both institutions to geochemistry. These include ongoing construction of a $45M Geochemistry Building and new appointments of senior and junior Faculty to the Geochemistry Division at LDEO, a new phase of cooperation between LDEO and AMNH, and an unprecedented commitment to stabilize instrument maintenance and technique development through institutional contributions to technical support.  The new instrumentation is linked in that it fosters interdisciplinary research across a spectrum of themes.  The noble gas mass spectrometer will measure neon isotope ratios for surface exposure dating, further the development of constant flux proxies for paleoceanography, and advance studies of mantle dynamics. The SC-ICPMS will fulfill a growing need for analyses of ultra-low trace element abundances in water, ice and aerosols. At present, these efforts are compromised by other measurements of high concentration samples using shared instruments. The high sensitivity of a new MC-ICPMS will allow measurement of isotope ratios in smaller samples than is currently feasible and will be linked with a laser, bought separately with institutional funds. The laser ablation MC-ICPMS capability will serve a large number of LDEO and AMNH researchers and students who now travel extensively in order to obtain LA-ICPMS analyses. The new instrumentation will open new avenues to advance knowledge on fundamental topics such as solid earth geodynamics, ocean dynamics and climate, as well as the transport and fate of contaminants in aqueous systems and the atmosphere.The instrumentation is also critical for providing state-of-the-art technology for Earth science research and education in the New York City area. The enhanced infrastructure will promote cross-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations. The equipment is critical to continuance of both a strong graduate education program and a research training program at both the undergraduate and high school levels.  Since 2000 LDEO Geochemistry has produced 19 Columbia PhD dissertations and AMNH has hosted 15 graduate students from various universities. Currently, 27 Columbia PhD students are associated with the groups requesting instrumentation through this proposal. LDEO labs serve graduate students from regional institutions, including CUNY and Stony Brook. LDEO geochemists are actively involved in REU programs (> 40 interns since 2000). The AMNH REU program has hosted 22 interns since it started in 2003, in which most have been women and several have been African American or Hispanic. LDEO geochemists also provide research opportunities for high school students (> 25 since 2000). The new instrumentation will make a fundamental contribution to meeting research and educational needs of at least two CUNY campuses (Queens and Kingsborough CC) and at Fordham University, where LDEO and AMNH adjunct researchers have faculty positions.  Geochemists in this project are extensively involved in public education and outreach, such as public lectures, news media contributions, popular articles, and spearheading prominent exhibits (e.g., the Halls of Planet Earth, and of Meteorites, and of Gems and Minerals at AMNH). The AMNH exhibits and other public programs are important tools of public science education; some 4.5M people, including >0.6M K-12 students, visit AMNH each year. Geochemists involved in this proposal regularly give lectures in the Earth2Class Program (www.earth2class.org/) for K-12 science teachers. LDEO scientists use their expertise as members of governmental advisory boards, including NYC Mayor Bloomberg?s Council of Sustainable Development. The new instrumentation provides essential tools for continuation of our public outreach efforts',\n",

       " \"We propose applying transcendence techniques to curves and abelian varieties in a family and to classical period maps to deduce transcendence properties for functions which are solutions of a Picard-Fuchs equation. This leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. These special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain Shimura subvarieties. This leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of Shimura varieties. We also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. We propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. A fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. A classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. This implies that e and pi are transcendental. In previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. We intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties\",\n",
       " 'The Arctic constitutes a unique and important environment, central to the dynamics and evolution of the Earth system. The region is currently experiencing rapid environmental change. The sources and ultimate consequences of such change are, however, still poorly understood. Research conducted as part of the NSF-ARCSS Arctic Freshwater Integration Study (FWI) program has documented not only the ongoing changes in the arctic hydrological cycle, but also the important role these changes play in global climate dynamics. Recently developed documents on research needs have emphasized the critical function of arctic freshwater processes in ecosystem, social and global systems. The recently released SEARCH Implementation Plan (SEARCH, 2005) describes changes in the freshwater system as one of the most consequential links between the arctic and the earth systems.

       " 'Copper amine oxidase (CAO) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) belong to a family of proteins that contain quinone cofactors that are formed post-translationally from tyrosine, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-phenylalanine quinone (TPQ), and lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the modification of biogenic amines and play roles in cell signaling and collagen formation. The structure/function study of these quinone cofactors is essential to characterize the differences in their chemical properties. Although the chemical function of TPQ in CAO catalysis has been well studied, very little is known about LTQ. Further, the role of copper in catalysis in both enzymes remains unclear. The research project will further define the chemical properties of TPQ and LTQ and the role of copper in CAO catalysis, as well as develop a model system to understand the chemical function of LTQ in LOX. The research utilizes the tools and techniques of biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinorganic and synthetic organic chemistry. The results of this research will not only broaden understanding of quinoproteins but also impact fundamental understanding of other cross-linked quinones that are widely found in nature. This will aid in understanding the evolutionary advantage of selecting one quinone cofactor over the other in biological systems.Broader Impact: This multidisciplinary project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to study at the interface of chemistry and biology and participate in an international collaboration. An outreach program will be initiated to invite female students from local high schools to spend two weeks in the Chemistry department at the University of Kansas. The students will work in the laboratory and meet with female faculty and graduate students to discuss both science and the issues facing women in chemistry. These experiences are intended to encourage more women to follow careers in chemistry by demonstrating at the outset that the academic environment can be supportive to women. The workshop will also show that chemistry is a diverse subject that is much broader in scope than what would typically be taught in high school. In concert, a chemical biology course targeting upper level undergraduate and graduate students will be developed to demonstrate how chemical methods are used to understand fundamental aspects of biological systems. The course will include protein chemistry, especially post-translational modifications as well as a survey of cutting edge discoveries, intended to show students that chemists can make important contributions at the cutting-edge of biological science. Students participating in the Initiative for Minority Student Development (IMSD)-Bioscience Initiative program at the University of Kansas will be encouraged to enroll in this course.

We believe that the evaluation of COSEE should focus on both the direct educational contributions that COSEE is making, but also on the more intangible contributions in terms of generating leadership, collaborations, knowledge and advocacy for the field. We also argue that the evaluation should help COSEE better understand itself, improving its design, informing its management, and refining its implementation. The COSEE Network represents a sophisticated arrangement that creates a national network linking together distinct Ocean Sciences Education Centers. The evaluation plan proposed here draws upon and adds to a knowledge base of the design principles underlying networks, centers, and science education improvement. The evaluation will not only document the contributions of the network to public and professional audiences, but also study the network as an example of an improvement infrastructure for Ocean Sciences education. This conceptualization will help to create an evaluative framework that will allow for a richer understanding of the multiple dimensions of NSF's investments in large complex network projects. The evaluation will thus contribute to the knowledge base that informs the design and evaluation of large-scale, field-building initiatives. This proposed evaluation plan will promote the improvement of education, particularly science education, in multiple ways. First, it will help COSEE understand the investment made in the Network by studying the ways in which and the extent to which the network is serving its intended audiences and providing well-designed opportunities for a variety of audiences to learn Ocean Science. Second, the evaluation will help the COSEE Network better manage the use of its resources, by understanding the needs and opportunities for refining the way in which the Network operates. Third, the evaluation will contribute to a better understanding of ways in which the Network builds both individual and collective capacity for doing high-quality Ocean Sciences education. And finally the evaluation will contribute to a better understanding of how this design -- a network of independent centers -- can be used in other arenas to further develop a national improvement infrastructure for science education\",\n",
       " 'The objective of this proposed workshop is to lay the groundwork for implementing the recommendations that were developed through The ?5XME? Workshop, held on May 10-11, 2007 in  Arlington, Virginia. The proposed workshop will develop curricular templates, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, based on the recommendations from the previous report, for various types of schools (e.g., large public, large private, small public, small private). It is anticipated  that these templates will facilitate the adoption of the 5XME recommendations by a wide cross section of mechanical engineering departments across the country.A diverse group of mechanical engineering educators will be brought together in the workshop to ensure that all points of view and learning styles are fully considered. These workshop participants will represent leaders (e.g., department heads, program advisors) from a variety of schools (i.e., small, large, public, private) to reduce the barriers to implementation of curricular reforms in mechanical engineering departments across the country',\n",
       " \"The goal of the Firefly cubesat is to unambiguously determine if Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (TGFs) are produced by lightning, and to determine the characteristics of lightning that produce the fluxes of gamma rays observed at high altitude.  This information will strongly constrain the processes that accelerate electrons to ~35 million electron volts (MeV) above thunderstorms, since these electrons are thought to be the source of TGFs.  Firefly will detect a minimum of 50 TGFs, with a goal of more than 200, to definitively determine the types of lightning that produce gamma rays.  TGFs are of inherent interest, as they result from the most powerful natural particle acceleration process on Earth, in which thermal electrons are energized to tens of MeV in less than 1 millisecond.  These energized electrons create copious bremsstrahlung gamma and X-rays that can be observed from orbiting platforms, and the electrons themselves may escape to magnetospheric altitudes and populate the inner electron radiation belt.  By studying the TGF phenomena and the acceleration processes responsible for them on Earth, the investigators will improve understanding of other regimes of electron acceleration, including the radiation belts, solar flares, cosmic shocks, and other planets, including Venus, the outer planets, and dust devils and dust storms on Mars.  Firefly CubeSat satellite will be designed, built, tested, and operated on-orbit as part of this project. Firefly consists of two instruments: a gamma-ray detector (GRD) and a very low frequency receiver/ photometer experiment (VP).  GRD will measure photons between 10 keV - 10 MeV, and up-going energetic electrons over an energy range of 10 keV to a few MeV.  The Firefly team is a collaboration between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Siena College, with the Hawk Institute for Space Sciences serving as the spacecraft bus provider, and the systems engineering, education, and public outreach lead.  Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, from design and development, through fabrication and test, to mission operations and data analysis.  Firefly will help to train undergraduate students at Siena College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), as they get hands-on experience designing, building, testing, and operating the spacecraft, as well as analyzing the data.  Local high school students and interns will also have access to the Firefly data, educational materials, and website.  Finally, the Firefly project includes the installation of two World Wide Lightning Location Network ground stations at Siena and UMES, giving the students access to a tool that can be used for many data analysis projects, and that will be a permanent addition to the educational infrastructure at these institutions.  Firefly will support the development of a website, with continuous updates on the development of the instrument and spacecraft, and on-orbit mission status, open access to the data and science results, a  data users' manual , and a Firefly manual, including lessons\",\n",
       " 'Scheduling policies are explicitly (or implicitly) used everywhere that resources need to be allocated, and resultantly the theory of scheduling has a long and varied history.  Out of this large body of work, two distinct research communities have emerged and, unfortunately, researchers in each community are often not aware of results from the other community.  One set of researchers from the theoretical computer science and optimization communities has focused on providing competitive guarantees for scheduling disciplines in the worst-case environment.  A different set of researchers, from the performance modeling and applied probability communities, has focused on providing exact performance analyses of scheduling policies in stochastic/probabilistic environments.  Each of these approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages when carried out on their own.  The aim of this project is to develop techniques that can achieve the  best of both worlds , i.e., to combine ideas from each community to arrive at results neither has been able to achieve alone.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to develop approaches that combine worst-case results and techniques with qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing stochastic models, thus combining the breadth of models where worst-case results can be applied with the real-world applicability of stochastic analysis. This is an ambitious goal, but one that will open up a new avenue of research in an important, well established field.  If successful, it can bring together ideas from two distinct communities which attack similar problems with very different techniques, and thus is likely to identify new scheduling disciplines that will impact system design in practice.  Additionally, the project will have a broad impact on the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through the development of a new unified approach to teaching scheduling theory',\n",
       " \"This is a proposal to process the GRACE satellite range, range-rate, and range-acceleration data with a goal to obtain a map of the geoid over the Antarctic with spatial resolution between 35 and 100 km. The free-air gravity derived from this geoid should fundamentally change our view on geological structure and history of the Antarctic continent in much the same way that the GEOSAT mission impacted our understanding of plate tectonics in the world's oceans. Due to resource limitations, however, the GRACE project team will not use the range and its derivatives to generate high spatial resolution estimates of the gravity field along the satellite ground track. The new geoid and derived free-air gravity field will require development of an algorithm to process the range, range-rate and range acceleration data and convert them to a self-consistent geoid. The GRACE-derived gravity field will be compared with marine, airborne gravity and land-based surveys as well as with major geological features of the Antarctic continent to assess wavelength resolution. This comparison will require the integration of the airborne and marine data sets and determination of the subglacial topography for some of the airborne surveys. Once the new geoid and derived fee-air gravity have been generated, the continent-wide subglacial topography could be estimated via an optimal co-kriging interpolation of the available bedrock measurements and the geoid, joint with the statistical relationships describing the spatial variation of topography, and the spatial correlation of the geoid and topography. The subglacial topography will be also determined using an alternative approach, the Parker inversion method. These products will be made available to the ice sheet modeling community. The new continent-wide subglacial topography will be used in combination with altimetric ice surface elevations to calculate a new estimate of Antarctic ice sheet volume, which can be used to calibrate the eustatic sea-level curve from oxygen isotope data for the present and maximum possible variations of the global sea level curve. The new subglacial topography estimates will also be used to interpret geologic structures of the Antarctic and the processes responsible for their formation. This research will have several areas of broader impact and intellectual merit: (a) the map of subglacial topography, together with an improved estimate of the Antarctic ice volume, will be an important contribution to the science goals of the Antarctic Climate Evolution initiative (ACE). Modeling the nucleation of the East Antarctic ice sheet relies on high-quality subglacial topography models, as well as modeling the drainage of the entire ice sheet. (b) The proposed GRACE-derived gravity approach, if proven to be successful, can be applied to the Arctic region and indeed to the entire world. While the Arctic gravity field is of high quality south of 82 N (ERS-1 orbit coverage), a large polar gap remains. Mapping the main geological features in these hard-to-reach parts of the world from satellite measurements would be a significant step forward in understanding the plate tectonic features of the Artic and Antarctic and should extend significantly recent marine geological and tectonic studies of the region\",\n",
       " 'A Doppler High Frequency (HF) radar is placed at the Jicamarca Peru Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility for the purpose of untangling the processes that lead to the onset of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), and in turn to scintillations of radio signals traversing the ionosphere, including GPS signals.  The spectra and propagation of ionospheric perturbations just below the F-region peak are characterized, and their relationship to EPBs observed at Jicamarca is determined.  The variability of vertical ion drift in the enhanced ion density preceding the neutral wind reversal is determined during solar minimum conditions, and the relationship of that variability to equatorial plasma bubble onset is determined.  The extent to which neutral winds modulate the occurrence of EPBs, and possibly override otherwise effective triggering mechanisms is also evaluated using data from nearby Fabry-Perot interferometers.  The determined relationships between plasma perturbations below the F-region ionospheric peak, variability of the vertical ion drift, the neutral wind, and EPB onset are finally used to in an attempt to predict EPB generation, along with associated radio scintillations',\n",

The work helps fill a vast gap in our knowledge of the investment and innovation process for a large and important sector of economic activity in the United States. Traditional R&D spending captures the cost of the ?work done? by scientists and engineers because the innovation process in manufacturing is well understood to originate in a laboratory.  But where do financial innovations, such as credit default swaps, derivatives, electronic payment systems, ATMs, and the like originate?  A recent review of the empirical literature on financial innovation (Frame and White 2004) suggests little is known about the process.The novel aspect of our research will be to further develop available measures of intangible investment and capital by exploiting Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employer-based datasets on employment and wages by detailed occupation and industry. The BLS data will be used in combination with information obtained from semi structured interviews with industry executives to build estimates of the ?work done? by the employees (or contractors) who conduct the design and development activity in (or for) financial services firms.  The interviews will leverage the Conference Board?s extensive network of business contacts to obtain the required information as well as to generally expand our knowledge of the innovation process in financial services industries. The resulting industry-level series for finance R&D will both supplement traditional R&D measures and enhance the Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2006) macroeconomic estimates of the contribution of intangible capital to U.S. economic growth.Broader impacts:  The need for better metrics of innovation and the knowledge economy was underscored by the Advisory Committee on Innovation established by the Secretary of Commerce. One of its main findings was to better measure business intangible investments, and another was to develop a fuller accounting of the sources of economic growth. Our research aims to advance these two goals by working on a large and from the standpoint of the empirical productivity literature largely under researched sector of the U.S. economy',\n",
       " 'The NSDL Technical Network Services (TNS) project is providing a robust and extensible cyberinfrastructure foundation for the central services of the NSDL that enable a wide range of NSF grantees and outside partners to share technical capacity and deliver valuable educational tools and resources to their own communities. The project has four primary areas of effort:1) Engaging the NSDL and STEM education communities to nurture a common vision for NSDL and its technical infrastructure and to foster broad-based community contributions;2) Enabling NSDL to function as a shared, collaborative, contributory space supporting the creation and display of context around networked educational resources to enhance discovery, use, and understanding; 3) Supporting and extending the NSDL core infrastructure for implementing and developing new educational applications and networked tools for audiences across the full range of STEM research, learning, and education; and4) Ensuring that the NSDL network and its accompanying tools and services are a robust, reliable, and highly available resource for all users.The intellectual merit of this effort lies in the unique and potentially transformative opportunity it has to integrate a wide range of tools, services, content, and context from many different institutions and projects into a common framework of knowledge organization and discovery, enabling other projects to accomplish far more than they could have on their own. By integrating resources, description, context and contribution from many varied organizations, projects, and individuals, and by offering tools to explore and understand this knowledge space, the TNS project is serving as an important component of support for cyber-enabled STEM education in a networked world. The broader impacts of this project are felt along several directions. First, it is helping both NSF grantees and many other related educational projects to better serve their specific audiences by focusing less on recreating technical developments and focusing more on serving as sites for teaching, mentoring, and supporting research of large numbers of STEM students and teachers. Second, it is establishing a broad-based community engagement process to foster creativity, innovation, and contributions to the design and use of next-generation educational cyberinfrastructure and interactive learning applications. Third, it is instrumenting the NSDL infrastructure to collect detailed (anonymized) usage and behavioral data, providing the basis for next-generation research into: personalized learning, educationally-informed recommendation engines, formation and evolution of educational social networks, and other areas where large volumes of user-generated actions and activities are needed',\n",

Four primary goals guide the work of the center:1) Mobilization: to facilitate the flow of information and communications across NSDL projects to build community capacity, set priorities, and identify emerging issues so that the community can exploit its opportunities and address its challenges collectively.2) Synthesis: to mine the collective knowledge and experience of the community and synthesize the work of NSDL projects to inform community best practices.3) Dissemination: to place resources and research into the hands of educators through targeted outreach activities, by bundling specific products and services to meet users' needs, and by distributing NSDL products and services through trusted dissemination channels.4) Analysis and Evaluation: to create and foster a culture of data gathering and interpretation to support the analysis of needs and trends so that NSDL can create more effective products and services that meet the demands of STEM learners. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its core strategies of: i) brokering partnerships and opportunities on behalf of the community; ii) monitoring trends and practices; iii) promoting and advocating for NSDL; iv) customizing and contextualizing NSDL resources; v) putting NSDL in the path of users; and vi) systematic data gathering to inform short-term decision-making and long-term sustainability planning. Taken together these can serve as a model for Web 2.0 educational organizations. The project is exerting broader impacts through its dedication to the integration of research with education, the provision of services and support for teacher training, professional development, and STEM workforce growth.  By advocating for STEM education through partnership and capacity-building activities, across multiple disciplines and audiences, the center is extending NSDL's reach and effectiveness and creating new channels for reaching audiences and for understanding impact. This effort is essential to the realization of the NSDL community vision of transforming many distinct and important initiatives into an increasingly coherent whole, all in the service of STEM education\",\n",

       " 'This award will fund an analysis of the interactions between groundwater, soil and vegetation properties, and desert dust generation. Wind erosion of desert soils is thought to cause irreversible change to ecosystems, and the mobilized particulate matter can seriously degrade air quality. In deserts globally, regions that produce the most dust are characterized by low elevation depressions where wind erodible material has been and continues to be deposited fluvially. Shallow groundwater is often pumped from these regions for agricultural and municipal use. Since water demands are rapidly increasingly in many desert regions, there is increasing need to understand of how groundwater management might influence dust generation. Ideally, information could be attained that would guide groundwater management with the goal of promoting soil stability. This project will utilize measurements of vegetation and soil conditions and wind velocities to model wind erosion at a range of sites that experienced successively greater groundwater fluctuation over the past 20 years. Model results will be compared to direct measurements of recent soil loss using radiogenic fallout isotopes and dust traps. Finally, measurements of soil resource availability (nutrients and soil moisture) will be used to understand feedback processes between groundwater decline, soil loss, and ecosystem changes that might promote continued soil instability. Broader Impacts: The project will have a broad impact on our understanding of the role water management has on dust and air quality in deserts. The work will form collaborations between academic institutions and regulatory groups in the proposed study region, near Bishop, California. Both the Inyo County Water Department and the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District will provide necessary data to the project and gain important information on how their vegetation and air quality management activities could be tailored to gain long-term sustainability',\n",
       " 'The advent of computer and digital information technologies and there development have greatly changed the world we live in. Today digital technologies are everywhere in our lives. A key step that makes all those technologies possible is to convert analog data into digital ones, a process known analog-to-digital conversion, or A/D conversion. With demand for higher precision and more cutting-edge technologies, the mathematics of A/D conversion algorithms plays a key role in this quest. The research proposed in this proposal focuses mainly on the mathematics and algorithms of A/D conversion. Given that analog devices are to different degrees imprecise by nature, robustness is extremely important if high precision is desired. The proposal will focus on robust A/D conversion algorithms. In this proposal the PI will address two of the main sources of imprecisions: imprecise quantizations and imprecise multiplications. The proposed encoders are the first encoders to be completely robust against quantizer and multiplier imprecisions. The PI proposes to study both the algorithms and the mathematical questions that arise from the study. The PI also studies ways the encoders can be extended and refined, along with many related and often challenging mathematical problems. The core of this project is a novel class of analog-to-digital conversion algorithms. These algorithms have the advantage that they are robust against quantization errors (imprecisions) and multiplication imprecisions. The novelty of these A/D algorithms comes from the use of Golden Ratio based expansions of real numbers related to the Fibonacci numbers. More general algorithms involve a class of algebraic integers and matrix encoders. The PI and his collaborators have already built a circuit of an A/D converter based on one of our algorithms, which has yielded outstanding result. A main objective of this proposal is to study these algorithms in greater depth, particularly concerning the stability and robustness of these algorithms. Equally important is that the study of these A/D algorithms has raised a number of interesting and challenging mathematical questions. Graduate students will be involved in the project. In addition, the proposed research lends naturally to collaborations between mathematicians and the engineering community',\n",

       " 'This project develops novel computational approaches and analytical tools to meet the challenges and opportunities for social network analysis brought by the availability of large-scale longitudinal data generated by the usage patterns of modern communication devices, such as cell-phones. This type of data has several key advantages including the fact that it is statistically extensive (coming from millions of users), purely observational (void of any bias induced by obtrusive measurements), and longitudinal (spanning several years). The extent and longitudinal character of such data brings challenges that can only be tackled by an orchestrated multidisciplinary approach invoking social science, physics methods developed for large-scale interacting particle systems, mathematical statistics and data analysis, and computer science methods for data mining, and agent-based modeling. The project will focus in particular on generating 1) Novel computational and analytic methods for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of large-scale social network data, based on advanced nonlinear time-series methods, community detection algorithms, and probabilistic relational models; 2) Stochastic mathematical models for network behavior coupled across several levels of analysis, including node, dyad, triad and group levels, and 3) A data-driven stochastic individual-based simulation (SIBS) framework with predictive capability for macro-level system behavior, implementing the dynamic models from 2). The SIBS design will allow it to be used as a hypothesis generation multilevel framework for social dynamics, and as an application, it will be employed to uncover the modalities for efficient, targeted spread of information in large-scale dynamic social networks. The suite of methods developed, and the SIBS with its design transparency and parallelism provide data-driven, feature extraction tools for addressing social science questions, as well as aiding mechanism-design and decision-making in practical situations. In particular, they are expected to directly impact applications both within the commercial (product delivery, health-care services, etc.) and non-commercial (urban planning, emergency alert systems, etc.) domains',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that garnet-bearing amphibolites and pelitic schists from the northwest U.S. Cordillera preserve a record of late Mesoproterozoic high pressure metamorphism that can be attributed to significant crustal thickening along the western margin of Laurentia before or during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. To this end a research team from Washington State University, West Virginia University, and University of Idaho are undertaking an integrated geochronologic and metamorphic analysis of garnet-bearing metamorphic assemblages in the northwest U.S. Cordillera in order to: 1) determine the ages of metamorphism using Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of garnets and U-Th-Pb geochronology of monazites in order to determine the extent of Proterozoic metamorphism throughout the northwest U.S. Cordillera; 2) establish the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral growth in these metamorphic assemblages; 3) compare the results from the garnet and monazite chronometers and integrate this information with the metamorphic fabrics using detailed petrography; and 4) link both the geochronologic and pressure-temperature information to the penetrative deformational fabrics preserved in the rocks. Establishment of a linkage between late Mesoproterozoic metamorphism and the high temperature, high-pressure assemblages that exist in these rocks over a considerable area will show that a major period of crustal thickening during convergent tectonism occurred on the western margin of Laurentia at the end of the Mesoproterozoic. The presence of an approximately one billion year old contractional belt in the northwestern U.S., if confirmed, would imply that the history of metamorphism and deformation in the Cordillera is more complicated than previously appreciated. These results would provide important piercing points for late Mesoproterozoic tectonic reconstructions. In particular, results of this project will provide additional constraints on correlations of western Laurentia with other cratonal fragments such as Australia, Siberia, Antarctica, and China and will ultimately impact various reconstructions of Rodinia.The Grenville orogeny was an important event that substantially modified the North American continent approximately one billion years ago. The metamorphic rocks produced in this event can be found in wide belt that extends from eastern Canada to southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Preliminary geochronological data yielded the unexpected result that metamorphism of this age also occurred in the northwestern U.S. To confirm these data, this project is using new geochronological methods to determine the ages of minerals that are commonly produced during the metamorphism that occurs during mountain belt formation. If the preliminary results are born out, current understanding of the nature of the Grenville event will require revision. Evidence for a billion year old metamorphic event in the northwest U.S. would also require modification of current ideas about the configuration of continents at that time',\n",

       " \"Intellectual merit: U-series isotopes have revolutionized our ability to evaluate magmatic timescales and will be used in conjunction with Rb/Sr systematics to constrain the time in which large volumes of intraplate rhyolite are generated.  The timing and processes involved in the generation of silicic magmas are relevant to modeling activity at potentially explosive volcanoes, with significant climate and volcanic hazard implications. Baitoushan volcano (NE China/North Korea) is ideally suited for such studies because it has produced multiple young high silica rhyolites including a large volume (~100 km3) pyroclastic eruption as recently as ~1000 AD.  All eruptive units are sufficiently young that both short-lived 238U-230Th-226Ra and 235U-231Pa isotopic systems as well as long-lived radiogenic isotopes can be used in combination to assess magmatic timescales.  Moreover, sampling is sufficient to carry out the proposed work, thus saving on the time and cost of the proposed research. Timing of magmatic fractionation events involved in the generation of associated mafic and silicic magmas in this volcano will be evaluated through analysis of accessory phenocryst minerals. Single crystal Pb and Sr isotope analyses will also be used as tracers to quantify the effects of open-system processes such as crustal contamination, magma recharge, and post-eruption alteration. In combination these data will allow detailed assessment of such processes on the overall evolution of the volcano as well as their effects on the fidelity of the various isotopic dating methods.Broader Impacts include (1) involvement of an undergraduate into cutting-edge research in the geological sciences, (2) international collaborations, and  (3) relevance to volcanic risk assessment. Regarding the latter point,  a  seismic crisis  at Baitoushan within the last decade raised concerns that the volcano could erupt again in the near future.

       " \"MarineTech will serve 60 students in grades eight through twelve, over a period of three years, providing 144 hours of instruction and hands-on learning experiences in the fields of marine engineering and physical sciences with a shipbuilding focus. The program will run for eight Saturdays during academic years, with an additional two-week academy during the summers. MarineTech's progressive curriculum covers foundational skills and knowledge of basic physical science as it relates to ship building, through the application of these principles in a culminating ship design competition. The curriculum is enriched with program activities such as field trips to shipbuilding and repair companies, marine science museums and career day events.  MarineTech concurrently targets 60 math, science, and technology education teachers for grades eight through twelve, each of whom will receive 40 hours of summer professional development and 40 hours of follow-up training and support. Teachers will work an additional 40 hours in working with their students to build underwater robots and design and build a human powered container ship for competition. Participating teachers will be fully trained in curriculum implementation and will be given materials and resources necessary to replicate MarineTech activities in their classrooms.  MarineTech addresses the urgent need to enhance under-represented students' interest and performance in STEM courses, while fostering skills that are important prerequisites for STEM careers, particularly in marine engineering, physical science and information technology. In the near term, the project will incorporate activities designed to boost student scores on academic achievement measures.  However, the project also addresses the critical shortage of qualified workers needed to sustain the ship building and repair industry in the USA\",\n",
       " \"In the post 9/11 environment, a new form of organization has spawned in which public sector agencies and private organizations collaborate in designing complex IT-enabled infrastructures -  systems that provide shared service delivery. This research will study and recommend design elements essential for architecture and governance structures that promote interorganizational success in using these systems. This project will draw on relevant knowledge from public administration, organizational theory, and information systems. It will focus on: (1) the design of collaborative systems that explicitly address the organizational needs of the technical infrastructure and (2) interactions among the system design elements and participating organizations that can best leverage such systems. Public safety collaborations currently use either packaged or open-standards systems to support interoperability among police, fire, rescue, homeland security and other public safety agencies. Examples of the packaged software systems include those from COPLINK and Motorola. Examples of open standards systems include Pennsylvania's Justice Network (JNET), the D.C. area's Capitol Wireless Integrated Network (CapWIN) and the San Diego area's Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS). The current proposal will expand upon initial empirical and theoretical work conducted by its investigators based on CapWIN, ARJIS and JNET, and other interorganizational collaborative settings.Expected contributions:The researchers identify three key reasons to focus on infrastructures for interorganizational collaboration in the public safety domain. First, such systems are exemplars of how future networked organizations that exist because of IT, and effectively use it, might look. Second, they represent some of the most innovative thinking in digital government. Third, these systems, in their design and use, have direct benefits relative to public safety. These include improved homeland security, better delivery of governmental service and safer communities, while they impart substantial scientific value relative to design principles for both collaborative systems and the organizations using them. In furthering such research, the United States will provide leadership addressing current challenges that national and international public safety organizations face. The project will employ a design-centered approach in order to achieve improved and more robust IT infrastructures to support interorganizational information sharing. It will combine detailed empirical investigation using several field-based data collection methods, and will analyze extensive secondary data available on public safety in the United States. It will synthesize existing literature across a range of relevant disciplines to support theoretical and practical design recommendations for collaborative IT infrastructure and supportive organizational governance principles and structures.The intellectual merit of the work derives from:1. Interdisciplinary insights drawn from public administration and political science, organizational information systems, and information technology.2. Empirical research design that leverages the best aspects of intensive case study and a large-sample survey.3. Focus on technical design features and architectural principles that are essential to collaborative success.4. Analysis of institutional governance structures and processes that are critical for support of successfulimplementation and operation of collaborative systems.5. Emphasis on building theory that can be generalized to many domains in which IT supports public-private collaborations.The broader impact of the work is to improve:1. Public safety and homeland security via better systems design to support information sharing.2. IT-enabled public-private collaborations, regardless of context\",\n",

       " \"This is a collaborative research project on the shaping of ecological and evolutionary biology at Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. The project examines the organizational structures and theoretical commitments guiding MVZ's development across the 20th century. It aims to show how MVZ's continuity in program provided a broad platform for technical and institutional change. Initiated by its first director, Joseph Grinnell, and guided by concerns about ongoing changes in native fauna and their environment, MVZ's research on vertebrates was integrated from the start with the practice of collecting specimens with diverse associated data. MVZ built on Grinnell's vision to achieve special strengths in biodiversity informatics and long-term comparative bio-geographical, ecological, and evolutionary studies, while bringing new concerns and techniques on board. The museum thus provides a window into the reconfiguration of natural history over a century of profound change. The project documents, analyzes, and makes public MVZ's history from the Grinnell era forward. It characterizes the museum as an organization initially built around a single research program. It then shows how its theories, descriptions, and procedures proved both robust and flexible as circumstances changed. The project treats the museum as a system of arrangements for studying the changing spatial distributions of populations, evolution at the species and subspecies level, and the relation of species to their varying environments.The project addresses cutting-edge themes in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, as well as contemporary biology, integrating organizational considerations with theory construction with large-scale historical change. MVZ offers a window onto the simultaneous intellectual, organizational, and material transformations in twentieth-century American biology that are hard to grasp in the terms of a single discipline. It provides a way to track some of the complexities of evolutionary and ecological science with a high level of detail at a manageable scale. The research team's core consists of an historian, a philosopher, a biologist, and a sociologist with each having recognized expertise in the respective area of study of the biological sciences. The team also includes a research associate, the MVZ archivist, and graduate and undergraduate students, many of whom have worked on early stages of the project. The primary methodology is archival research in MVZ and other collections, with the MVZ's directors and curators forming the backbone of the account. Other sources will also be integrated. The project will produce a book, multiple scholarly articles, and a web exhibit.The team will disseminate its research results through print and web publication, and through conference presentations. It will also do so by effectively leveraging MVZ's centennial celebration. In addition to contributing to the research element of the project, the team members will promotes teaching, training, and learning at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Finally, the results of this project will serve to make MVZ into an unmatched site for reflection on the significance of the past for the present and future of university-based natural history museums. It will do so by showing MVZ to be a place where professionals and amateurs, researchers and students, and academic scientists and conservationists interacted. It will reveal connections among the vision of the museum's scientific personnel and the practices of MVZ students and staff, new ways of thinking in evolutionary biology, and concerns about disappearing native fauna shared among scientists, conservationists, hobbyists, policymakers, and other actors.Funds for this project were provided by a joint venture of the BIO and SBE directorates known as  Impacts of Biology on Society,  which is administered via the STS program\",\n",
       " \"This award supports theoretical research and education on novel quantum phases in orbital and large spin systems with cold atoms. The research explores novel quantum phases and emergent symmetries with cold atoms which are not accessible in usual solid state systems and provides guidance for new experiments. The application of symmetry principles is essential for this project which not only deepens our understanding but also provides the guidance to new discoveries.  A variety of methods in condensed matter physics and field theory are employed, including bosonization, the renormalization group, the large-N method, the self-consistent mean-field theory, and band structure calculations.The first research topic is the study of novel quantum phases in high orbital bands in optical lattices. The p-orbital bosons exhibit complex-valued many-body wave functions characterized by the formation of on-site orbital angular momentum moments. The research encompasses orbital superfluidity in various lattices which exhibit collinear ordering (e.g., staggered and stripe-like), non-collinear ordering, and ''frustrated'' distributions of orbital angular momentum moments. For fermionic orbital systems, the research will focus on the honeycomb lattice, which is a p_xy-orbital counterpart of graphene. The second research topic is the study of large spin physics with cold fermions.  Particular attention is paid to spin-3/2 systems which possess a generic SO(5) symmetry without fine tuning.  The symmetry gives rise to important consequences such as the protected degeneracy in collective excitations, new properties of the quantum Monte-Carlo sign problem, the quintet pairing superfluidity, and the four-fermion quartetting superfluidity. Planned investigations include quantum magnetism in the spin-3/2 systems and other large spin systems as well, such as the pseudospin-1 systems and the spin-5/2 systems.  The research will provide new ideas on exotic orbital superfluidity, orbital exchange physics, and emergent quantum magnetic states. It also suggests new directions for future experiments. Knowledge gained from this research deepens our understanding on strong correlation physics in both cold atom and condensed matter systems.This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems. Aspects of the research, particularly the underlying theoretical techniques, form part of the subject matter of the advanced physics courses being developed by the PI at his university.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education that seeks to predict new states of matter composed of ultracold atoms in artificial crystals of light. Researchers have found that atoms can be trapped in modulated laser beams much like electrons are trapped in the force fields of atomic nuclei in a crystalline solid. Electrons have two internal configurations; these are related to their magnetic properties. Atoms can have many more internal configurations, leading to possible new states of matter that have no counterparts in conventional materials, but have intriguing properties and may display interesting phenomena. The research develops theories to explain the novel quantum mechanical properties of these cold atoms in crystals of light. The theories provide guidance for new experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum physics and states of matter and leading to new discoveries.  This is fundamental research that lies at the interface of atomic and condensed matter physics. However, systems of cold atoms are intriguing and may hold possibilities for future technologies. Conspicuous among these is the potential to realize powerful new methods of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics. This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields.

The methods used range from exact mathematical analysis to computer simulations. These approaches  bridge the gap between rigorous results and applications.Research topics employed by PI and collaborators are varied.  Using mesoscopic free energy functionals allows investigation of periodic states, wetting in mixtures and droplet formation in supersaturated vapor. An ongoing effort continues on fluctuations and large deviations in nonequilibrium stationary states and partial currents. This includes cases where the hydrodynamic scaling is inadequate. Significant advance continue in fundamental studies such as  establishing Fourier?s law of heat conduction in open systems with anharmonic interactions. In quantum statistical physics,  the study of  subsystems of large quantum systems leads to understanding of when these systems have density matrices given by canonical Gibbs measures. In some cases, such as the study of ionization of model quantum systems in time periodic fields,  there are applications to laser induced transitions in atoms and molecules. Beyond physics, researchers also  apply statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology involves derivation of reaction-diffusion equations via scaling limits and these are planned investigations.The  research activities are  highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences.

The goal of this research is to build a very large number of phylogenetic trees and then construct simple search and retrieval tools to match these trees to any query list of species in which a user may be interested.The primary impact of this research will be outside of the phylogenetics research community. Users of phylogenetic trees span most areas of modern biology: epidemiologists, genomicists, functional morphologists, conservation biologists, and community ecologists, to name a few. A repository of molecular phylogenies built using a consistent methodology, and satisfying prescribed minimal levels of statistical confidence, will provide users a level of consistency needed for strong inferences within and between comparative biological studies',\n",

       " \"Meritorious patents are a principal currency of an innovation-driven society.  They create an incentive for the production of novel inventions.  But the integrity of the patent system is compromised when, as the Commissioner of Patents has noted, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) lacks optimized informational resources to determine if a patent application reflects a new and non-obvious invention, as the law requires. To date, scientific researchers have been unable to help the USPTO find the information it needs. The arcane language of patent applications conveys insufficient information to enable effective communication among patent professionals and the community of scientists and others in the public who would otherwise provide valuable information and insight to the USPTO.  Tagging and visualization, two software-driven techniques that are used to enhance access to digital information, are in common use in commerce, but they have yet to be applied to a vast store of scientific information in the public sphere, including patents. Tagging is the process by which a keyword is assigned to an item of information; it describes the information and allows it to be readily searched (e.g. labeling photos on web-based photo-sharing services).   By tagging different information with the same tag, associations can be made.  Visualization refers to a variety of techniques for graphically representing relationships (e.g. graphical representations of census data or voting patters).  These two tools of tagging and visualization open great opportunities for using science to unlock essential information and make it available in a useable form that will benefit government, the scientific community and the public.The Open Patent project, based at New York Law School's Center for Patent Innovation, studies the application of tagging and visualization tools in the context of patents.   This project builds on New York Law School's Peer-to-Patent pilot program, which it created in 2006, and launched in 2007, in cooperation with the USPTO to improve the quality of information available to patent examiners through on-line public participation. Using social networking tools, the Peer-to-Patent website enables self-selecting technical experts to identify and submit bibliographic information, known as prior art, relevant to examining the claims of the patent application.  Data from the first year of Peer-to-Patent demonstrates that the public can, and does, contribute information that assists patent examiners in more effectively determining patent eligibility. Using data developed through the Peer-to-Patent project, the Open Patent project takes as its premise that, for the patent system to continue to promote science and innovation, new scientific tools are necessary to enable: patent examiners to understand the claims of an application for which a patent is sought; competitors to know the scope of a granted patent in order to innovate around it; and the scientific and technical public to find and discuss patents related to their research.  The Open Patent project takes advantage of information generated by reviewers in the Peer-to-Patent project to study the effects of user-generated tagging and visualization on the exchange of information in the patent process.  Experts from law, political science, information and computer science, library science and design are engaged in developing user interfaces for the development of these tags.  The new approach should enable patent examiners and the participating public to readily define and perceive patterns of association among information relevant to patents.  The hypothesis to be tested is whether enabling public tagging of patents and applications will: 1) enable scientific research communities to develop knowledge bases of patents relating to their area of research; 2) produce a demonstrable increase in rates of public participation by the scientific community in the USPTO public patent review program; and 3) enable patent examiners to identify more relevant information to assist with the patent examination process.Broader Impacts:  This research has ramifications for improving the quality of issued patents and the exchange of information between a government agency and the scientific public, on an international basis. In addition, this research develops  new models, analytic tools and datasets that can also be applied in the science policy decision-making process in many other domains\",\n",
       " 'Collaborative Research: Project IBORC: Interaction between Building and Occupant Responses during Collapse Abstract The primary objective of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary investigation ? at the intersection of structural engineering, social science, and computer science ? of how building occupants respond to signals issued by a building during and immediately after a compromising event that threatens its integrity. Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research.

       " \"Innovation is becoming more open, often involving multiple organizations in a division of innovative labor (DoIL).  The division of innovative labor in the economy is conceived of as the distribution across firms and other organizations of the following steps in the innovation process: 1) research/idea generation; 2) development; and 3) commercialization.  Despite its importance, there is little broad-based, systematic evidence on the extent or nature of the DoIL, nor on its impact on firm performance or the rate of technical advance.  The project collects the first systematic data on the DoIL for the United States by surveying over 20,000 firms in manufacturing and selected service industries,.   The collected data quantifies key features of the DoIL.  It also provides the basis for developing and empirically testing models of the DoIL and its effects on innovative performance.  The project addresses a number of important questions, such as the extent to which startups, as compared to established firms, are generators of new ideas, the importance of universities as sources of industrial innovation, and the extent to which firms' use of external knowledge inputs increases their innovative performance. Finally, the research advances the economics of innovation by generating formal models that capture the DoIL and testing those models empirically.Broader Impacts: This project is the first national effort to collect data on innovative activity generally, going beyond R&D and patenting. It is an important addition to the data infrastructure required for a science of science and innovation policy.  By generating new data on innovative activity, creating new metrics, and developing new models of the innovation process, the research also informs both public policy and firm strategy.  The research should contribute to deliberations on intellectual property policy and policies on standards and cooperative research and development agreements that potentially affect the growth of technology markets and the DoIL.  By highlighting the role of small firms, startups, and universities in the innovation process, the findings should also help inform federal support to university research and new firm formation.  The project findings should also contribute to the federal government's ongoing efforts to improve its collection of data on industrial R&D and innovation.  The research also contributes to the management of innovation by highlighting the returns to extramural knowledge sourcing, or strategic alliances formed to develop or commercialize new technologies\",\n",
       " 'Explaining the Education Effect and the Demography of Risk: Comparing Unschooled and Schooled on Everyday Reasoning and Decision-making Skills about Health BehaviorCO-PIs: David Baker, Penn State University; Martin Benavides, The Group for Analysis of Development, Lima Peru; Ellen Peters, Decision Research, Eugene OR AbstractThis multidisciplinary project combines cognitive science and the psychology of decision making with cross-cultural sociology of education to test how formal schooling influences reasoning and decision-making skills used to navigate everyday health risks.  Basic education is now rapidly expanding around the world, and demographic literature brims with results showing the robust positive association between formal schooling and health. The education effect is so large that education is often assumed to be a major cause of the demographic transition of modern society, which consists of reduced mortality and fertility, and longer life spans. While most demographers and health researchers acknowledge the persistent and significant association between formal schooling and positive health outcomes, why education has this influence is not well understood and a multidisciplinary investigation of how this effect occurs is the chief intellectual merit of the proposed study. It is hypothesized that schooling, through the teaching of subjects like mathematics, enhances reasoning, risk-assessment and decision-making skills that schooled individuals bring to bear on everyday health risks. The innovation of the proposed project is that it tests an explanation of education?s association with health by comparing unschooled and moderately schooled adults on their numeracy ability, cognitive skill, reasoning about risk, and decision-making skills related to health behaviors in the Peruvian Andes, where local conditions allow for a found-quasi-experiment on the effects of education. Broader impacts of this project include the potential to design more effective education for the significant parts of the world that have yet to reap the health benefits of the demographic transition and must do so rapidly to emerge out of the extreme poverty that hinders their long-term development. Hypothesizing links between schooling and basic cognitive-skill enhancement and, through them, improved decision making is a new approach to considering the wide impact of schooling on health behavior, a major social issue facing the future of human society.  Many non-government organizations are attempting to use various educational approaches to improve individuals? health decisions in poor nations. Without a clear understanding of how to make the most of limited education resources, these efforts will not yield the positive social change envisioned',\n",
       " 'Over the past century, rapid growth of human population and the human economy has transformed landscapes around the world.  These transformations have reduced and fragmented natural habitat, resulting in loss of biodiversity and many ecosystem services.  Maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while meeting the needs of human society for food, fiber, fuel, and other essentials requires integrated assessment of the biological and economic consequences of land use and land management.  This interdisciplinary research project will develop and apply an integrated dynamic landscape-modeling approach to predict and compare how alternative policy incentives and market forces affect land-use decisions; how resulting land-use changes affect species conservation, carbon storage, and the value of commodity production; and how this will affect future land-use decisions.  The investigators will approach these questions by developing statistical models based on observed landowner behavior in order to predict likely land-use changes as a function of current land-use conditions, public policy, and market opportunities.  Land-use changes have consequences for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic returns.  Land-use patterns shaped by these decisions will serve as input into models that predict the status of species, the flow of ecosystem services, and the value of commodity production from the landscape.  Current land-use decisions and the resulting set of consequences will set the stage for future conditions that shape future policies and market opportunities, which, in turn, will affect future land-use changes.  This integrated approach will be used to analyze the likely effect of alternative policies on land-use change dynamics, the consequent trajectory for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic activities on the landscape.  The integrated dynamic landscape modeling approach will be applied to landscapes at several geographic scales, from the 48 contiguous states to regional analysis applied to the Willamette Basin in Oregon and the Northern Lakes Region in Wisconsin.  Two questions will be addressed by using different scales of analysis within the same modeling approach:  (1) How much difference does inclusion of increased detail and spatial resolution make to the analysis and results?, and (2) Can analyses be nested in the sense that one can use the broad-scale analysis to highlight areas and species of concern, at which point more detailed analysis can be undertaken using finer scale analysis?Conserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services necessary for human welfare in the long-run in the midst of a growing human economy with pressing current needs requires careful planning based on an understanding of the full set of consequences of human choices and actions.  This project will integrate economic and ecological research into a coherent framework to predict landscape dynamics and the effects of these dynamics on biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and economic production.  The integrated landscape model developed in this project will provide tools and insights that can be used to improve decision making by a broad range of stakeholders.  By facilitating careful thinking about the pattern, extent, and intensity of human activities across the landscape through time, this project may help landowners and policy makers to achieve important species conservation and ecosystem service objectives while also generating high economic returns over the long term.

       " 'Broad changes in urban structure have caused increased concentrations of poverty in the United States. Research over the last 25 years has demonstrated effects of neighborhood context on individual and social outcomes, including educational performance and attainment, risky behavior and health, child bearing, and family structure and decision making.  In response, extensive local public policy and investment has been directed at low income neighborhoods, often called economic or community  development,  with the goal of changing neighborhoods and improving individual well being. However, there has been little scientific research on the impact of these investments and policies. Previous studies have compared outcomes in different neighborhoods, or studied people who move from one neighborhood to another.  This study focuses on the same neighborhood before and after significant publicly-driven investment.In the study, observations of neighborhood conditions, responses on household surveys, results from economic experiments, reports from students, parents and teachers, and administrative school district data are collected.  This study exploits geographic location to test how publicly-driven investment changes the physical and social landscape of a neighborhood and the well-being of its residents.  This study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to study a poor neighborhood in Dallas, Texas that will experience significant public investment within the next five years, including a light rail project that will bring three stations.  In addition, transit oriented development zoning, philanthropic and nonprofit activities, a HOPE VI award, and tax increment financing districts will encourage private investors to develop the neighborhood.  We expect that these projects will drive significant change especially around the stations, while change will be less dramatic as distance from the stations increases, creating  treatment and control groups  for comparison and implementing a scientifically valid study. The neighborhood is primarily African-American and Hispanic and the research involves African-American and Hispanic student research assistants for data collection and research support.  Additionally, community-based workers participate in the collection of data. Our documentation of the impacts of publicly-driven investment in a poor urban neighborhood will yield valuable insights to city planners and policy makers. The data is of interest to other social and behavioral scientists, including researchers in public health, education, and many other fields.

       " 'This award supports theoretical research and education with an aim to advance understanding of how classical dynamics arises from quantum mechanical dynamics. The quest to demonstrate behavior described by quantum mechanics in the mechanical properties of nanoscale and larger structures is of fundamental significance for understanding how the macroscopic classical world emerges by approximation from the quantum world, as well as for advancing the state of the art in ultrasensitive measurement technology. Experimental efforts are currently underway that employ either optomechanical or solid state electromechanical schemes to realize these goals. In the former schemes, the quantum coherent nature of optical cavity modes are employed to drive a typically larger-than-micronscale mechanically compliant mirror into a nonclassical state, as well as to measure this state. In the latter schemes, a controllable quantum coherent superconducting device drives a nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonator into a nonclassical state via capacitive or inductive coupling, as well as measures this state.This research project consists of three interrelated thrusts that are particularly relevant to the superconducting device schemes, commonly called ?Quantum Electromechanical Systems.? The first thrust will investigate the significance of nonlinearities in amplifier dynamics for approaching the quantum limit of displacement detection, as well as for the related issue of using detector back-action to cool the mechanical resonator to its quantum ground state. The second thrust will address the contribution of tunneling two level system defects to the damping and decoherence rates of nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonators at dilution fridge and lower temperatures. The third thrust will analyze schemes to generate and detect entangled and superposition states of nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonators, as well as measure their decoherence rates. The schemes involve superconducting qubits embedded within microwave cavities that are employed for both qubit state control and readout. This theoretical research project is closely linked to experiments.The activity outlined in project one will provide training for a graduate student in theoretical physics. Projects two and three are intended for two rising junior undergraduates with an introductory-level understanding of quantum mechanics. Through working on the projects during their junior and senior years, they will graduate with a relatively advanced understanding of open system quantum dynamics.Non-Technical Summary:This award supports theoretical research and education with an aim to advance our understanding of how the familiar world governed by classical mechanics emerges from the seemingly counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics that describe phenomena on the scale of atoms and across even smaller length scales. In close connection with experiment, the PI will study tiny mechanical resonators that are driven to oscillate by devices that are described by the rules of quantum mechanics. The operation of this sort resonator device lies at what seems like an interface between the world governed by classical mechanics and that governed by quantum mechanics. The study of these kinds of systems advances fundamental knowledge and also addresses some very practical questions, including: What are the fundamental limits of measurement? What is the most sensitive measurement device that can be made? Questions of this kind become more pressing as our science and technology press to every smaller length scales with the vision of devices, electronic and mechanical, that are perhaps only few atoms in one or more dimensions and somehow have one aspect that appears squarely in the world of quantum mechanics and others that appear to be squarely in the world of classical mechanics.This research will provide valuable educational experiences for a graduate student in theoretical physics, as well as for junior undergraduate students with an introductory-level understanding of quantum mechanics. Through working on the projects during their junior and senior years, the undergraduate students will graduate with a relatively advanced understanding of dynamics at the ?divide? between classical and quantum mechanics',\n",

       " '0847752PI- Gert CauwenberghsABSTRACTThis exploratory research project aims to observe and augment the learning experiences of children through non-intrusive acquisition,  on-line analysis and interpretation of their brain dynamics.  Current systems for recording high-resolution encephalogram (EEG) dynamical brain activity are not suitable for this purpose because they distract the children and constrain their mobility by excessive wiring between electrodes and computer.  Existing methods are also not useful because of unreliable contact between electrodes and scalp during body motion.  This two-year project specifically entails the design and implementation of a low-weight wearable, wireless EEG recording system with 128 embedded non-contact electrodes.  This will include supporting software for real-time analysis and display of brain dynamics on a host computer.  The research will give rise to new methods for non-intrusive acquisition and on-line interpretation of brain dynamics, and open up new research directions not possible using existing methods.  The project supports inter-disciplinary graduate research combining biophysics of EEG, engineering of non-contact and wireless sensors, independent component analysis, cognitive neuroscience, and the temporal dynamics of learning.Outcomes of this research will contribute to the broader understanding of brain function at a level combining cognitive neuroscience and social dynamics.  A diverse and interdisciplinary body of students at the NSF Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) and the Institute of Neural Computation at UCSD will take part in applying the instrumentation to learning research in the biological, cognitive and social sciences.  The wireless EEG infra-structure also significantly enhances the mobility of EEG recording in existing motion-capture facilities at TDLC, allowing the study of learning in dynamic environments with freely interacting subjects.  The project will further benefit from outreach channels supported by the TDLC, including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Hughes Scholar Program (HSP), and the Preuss High School at UCSD',\n",

       " 'This interdisciplinary research project, funded by the Science, Technology, and Society Program, seeks to better understand the social consequences of surveillance.  The growing prevalence of surveillance, facilitated by increasingly sophisticated information technologies, is well documented. However, the social implications for democratic societies of so much tracking, monitoring, and sorting of individual behavior is less well-understood.  At the same time, interest in transparency policies is growing in calls for more transparency of government and corporate practices.  Transparency is seen as a remedy for the negative effects of surveillance.  This project reframes surveillance and transparency in viewing them both as systems of accountability.  Accountability provides a novel lens through which to view the normative structures of these two systems and will be understood to involve: (1) an individual or organization; (2) an account of that individual or organization, focused on a particular domain of activity; and (3) a group, organization, or individual that uses the account to make decisions.  Further, surveillance and transparency will be analyzed as sociotechnical systems: the social structures and cultural meanings constitute, and are in turn constituted by, the information technology systems in which they are realized.  This framework will guide the creation of five case studies which will provide the basis for analysis and cross-comparison.  The five cases cover government, corporate and non-profit organizations.  An interdisciplinary team of scholars will analyze the cases and do the cross-case comparisons, yielding both new insights into transparency and new understandings of the social implications of surveillance.  These analyses will examine how the rationales for creation of systems gets translated into their actual workings; how IT has an impact on that translation; and how the systems affect underrepresented groups in science and engineering',\n",

About 92 percent of enrolled and graduating students are African American minorities. Minorities are under represented in the fields of sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics. This under representation of African Americans is more severe in certain sciences, such as Entomology, where out of 5,000 registered members of the Entomological Society of America only 32 are African Americans. Entomology, the study of insects, is very important due to the impact of insects on agriculture and public health.

       " 'The exchange of carbon between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle.  Movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system.  In most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system.  If the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling.  The specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in Massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles.  A multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon.  The research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions.  Outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone.  The focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for K-12 education.  The principle investigator is partnered with the Math and Science Center of Virginia.  Three teacher-student teams consisting of one high school biology or earth science teacher and four 10th grade students, with priority given to students from under-represented groups, will participate in a  two-week, field-oriented institute to educate and provide research experiences',\n",
       " 'In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data. In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program',\n",
       " 'Study of Emerging Networks in Outbreak ResponsePrincipal Investigators: Christopher Ansell, Ann Keller, Art ReingoldWith an increasing global population and greater ease of transportation, the threat of infectious disease pandemics is larger than it has been in the past.  Infectious diseases have the potential to spread rapidly across national borders.  In order to respond effectively, governments, experts, and organizations must be able to coordinate information and activities with one another.  Yet, no two outbreaks are alike which makes it difficult for organizations to take advantage of past experience to guide them in the face of a new outbreak.  This is especially true when the outbreak involves a new disease.   Information about the number and distribution of cases is rarely complete and little may be known about the disease itself and how it spreads.  In such cases, experts have to learn about the disease as it occurs and face many uncertainties that make communication and decision-making difficult.  Under these conditions, participants face substantial challenges in mobilizing a coordinated, effective response.  This study makes use of an international team of researchers who will study the actors in key organizations as they respond to any significant disease outbreak that occurs during the study period.  The project will use an internet survey to collect information from key participants as an outbreak occurs.  In addition, researchers will bring together the major participants of an outbreak after the event to discuss the event itself and the information collected on-line. The researchers will then analyze this information to learn about the nature of the interactions between individuals, organizations, and countries as they attempted to share information and coordinate activities to mobilize an effective response.  This study will significantly improve our understanding of the interactions among participants by gathering information about outbreak response efforts as they occur.  This represents an improvement over existing studies that attempt to recreate the significant events of an outbreak after the outbreak ended.  By studying the events as they occur, this research will provide a more accurate picture of the problems that arise as individuals, organizations, and governments who mobilize in response to an international outbreak attempt to coordinate their activities.  By learning more about the successes and pitfalls associated with international outbreak response, this research will develop strategies to improve the way that the international community manages infectious disease outbreaks that cross national borders',\n",
       " 'Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this activity relates to continuing the search for ancient biomaterials trapped in primary halite crystals of significant geological age. These live organisms, DNA and/or viruses represent the state of evolution during each of the ages represented by the salts. They are also significant study materials for issues of long-term survival of microbial species and the possible movement of microorganisms from planet to planet across space. Recent research has shown that halophilic microorganisms can be isolated from brine inclusions in salt crystals of variousages (Norton and Grant 1988, Vreeland et al. 2000) and that fragments of bacterial and haloarcheal DNA can be recovered from fluid inclusions in ancient halite (Fish et al. 2002, Park et al. 2008 PNAS submitted). These reports are only the latest in a series of announcements made over the last century (Namyslowski 1919, Dombrowski 1961, Tasch 1963, Reiser and Tasch 1960). One study (Vreeland et al. 2000) has received significant publicity because of the extreme sterilization techniques used to avoid contamination by modern microorganisms. The 250-million-year-old Virgibacillus (strain 2-9-3) reported by Vreeland et al. (2000) has profound implications for long-term survival on Earth and for finding life on planets such as Mars. This project will continue to advance these fascinating discoveries. The research will be conducted in two different Permian-aged salt formations in an attempt to duplicate the original NSF funded discovery. Further, the project will gather additional samples from even older formations (Devonian 320 million years of age; Silurian 412 MYA) in an attempt to document sound evidence for even longer term survival in primary halite minerals. Due to the excellent preservation of the sites, vertical samples will also be obtained from an entire evaporation cycle in order to examine population differences that might have occurred as the saline chemistry of the ancient lakes changed over time. In addition, the project will examine these same layers in different horizontal samples of each of the mines in order to develop data regarding the spatial distribution of biological materials in each of the formations. The microbial populations in these various formations will be studied using both culture dependent and independent assays. Consequently, this project will provide data on the types of microbes that are able to survive within the salts while concurrently providing the first systematic DNA-based survey of microbial diversity within the formations and that may have been present during the original precipitation of the salt formations. The project also includes the first examination of these primary salt brines for the presence of bacterial viruses trapped within the ancient brines that formed the fluid inclusions within the crystals. Broader Impact: The project has many broad areas of impact including the support and training of several research interns, supporting training for several K-12 teachers in a joint educational effort between the PI and the Kansas Underground salt museum, and providing training in geobiology to a current NSF minority Post-Doctoral fellow who has expressed a sincere desire to become involved in the rapidly developing field of geological microbiology with a specific interest in the study of ancient biomaterials. In addition, the research focuses on an area of great public interest as it seeks to break the current record for the oldest live organism known while at the same time attempting to duplicate previous work that isolated the current record, a Permian aged microbe (ca. 250 MYA',\n",

       " 'Tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. Energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. Although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. Despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to Holocene and younger deposits. Although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. Within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. The largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms. Carbonate strata within the Proterozoic Atar Group, Mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. The wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the West African craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). Furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. This project, a collaboration between the University of Tennessee Knoxville and Ohio University, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact. This project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two Investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. Both investigators have a long history of public outreach. The University of Tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. These exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers in implementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern Tennessee',\n",
       " 'Innovation and discovery involve individuals working successfully together in teams. It is critical for the Science of Science and Innovation Policy to understand how the cognition of individuals, the direct source of novel ideas and critical decision making, is impacted by social teamwork variables. Prior research has typically studied social teamwork variables in isolation or individual cognition variables in isolation. To know how to intervene to increase engineering and scientific output, the relationships between the two must be known, or else we might improve one at the cost of hurting the other, which likely would have no net improvement in final scientific or engineering productivity. The current project examines a very large quantity of video data collected from a recent highly successful case of science and engineering, the Mars Exploration Rover, which both wildly exceeded engineering requirements for the mission and produced many important scientific discoveries. Yet, not all days of the mission were equally successful. From this video record, the project traces the path from the structure of different subgroups (such as having formal roles and diversity of knowledge in the subgroups) to the occurrence of different social processes (such as task conflict, breadth of participation, communication norms, and shared mental models) to the occurrence of different cognitive processes (such as analogy, information search, and evaluation) and finally to outcomes (such as new methods for rover control and new hypotheses regarding the nature of Mars).Another critical factor for Science of Science and Innovation Policy is to examine both divergent thinking and convergent thinking. Innovation rarely happens unless new ideas are considered. But progress will not happen unless the best ideas among the proposed set are ultimately selected. To know how to best intervene to improve discovery and innovation, progress must be made on finding out when to intervene, which likely depends upon whether divergent or convergent thinking is currently required. A number of prior inconsistent research results likely resulted from a failure to separately consider divergent and convergent thinking. The current project examines both elements to build a much more complete model of how cognitive and social variables come together to produce new and successful engineering innovations and scientific discoveries. Broader Impacts: The US is facing serious challenges in the fields of science and technology. Innovation must be harnessed to generate new products, create employment opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. It is vital that the flourishing of science and engineering teams be examined with the same rigor as other important human endeavors. This project also has implications for science and engineering education: as ways of composing, structuring, and instructing teams are examined, suggestions for pedagogy will be formulated based on empirical findings',\n",

       " \"The proposed research is designed to enhance science-related education for at-risk students and others with diverse learning needs. Recent research has demonstrated that deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students come into the STEM classroom with less information than hearing peers and also learn less. Results consistently have shown that neither students' reading levels nor communication skills are sufficient to explain this situation. The proposed project will focus on the effects on learning of DHH students' comprehension monitoring skills and their relatively lesser content knowledge and infrequent use of integrative learning strategies. Experiments involve participants' reading or seeing presentations and then answering questions, summarizing content, and/or identifying other features of the presented information prior to learning assessments. With one exception, content is presented in signed, spoken, or written form. Students will make judgments about the expected accuracy of their responses; these and other methods will be used to assess their awareness of ongoing comprehension in addition to learning per se. It is expected that metacognitive accuracy will vary as a function of factors such as method of presentation, mode of communication, the nature of the material, and possibly several demographic variables. Of particular interest are measures of learning, ongoing comprehension monitoring, and the ways in which these influence each other. The research is expected to refute claims that deaf students' learning challenges are specific to printed materials or poor communication skills\",\n",

This SGER supports the co-development of the civilian sector intervention. The skills the Navy needs in basic mathematics are the same skills necessary to meet basic technical job requirements in the civilian sector - essentially pre-algebra and algebra skills. The project will use CRESST's POWERSOURCE middle school mathematics intervention for this study. The majority of Navy recruits deficient in mathematics are from under represented communities - these are the same communities that are a disadvantage in the civilian workforce because of their lack of basic mathematics skills.

       " 'Non-native plant species are an ever-present part of forests today and often negatively influences their adopted natural habitat by reducing survival of native plant and animal species. The present study will investigate the impact of Amur honeysuckle, an invasive non-native shrub, on the forests of Southwestern Ohio. The research will focus on nutrient cycling within this ecosystem by examining the relationship between organic inputs (e.g., fallen leaves), soil nutrients, and soil microbial diversity and composition (bacteria and fungi).  These parameters strongly influence how fast nutrients are cycled through an ecosystem and may be an important predictor of what species will be most successful in an area.  The study will elucidate differences between forested sites with and without honeysuckle and examine the potential for and time-scale of recovery of below-ground resources through honeysuckle removal experiments.The results of this research will provide new insights that may enhance forest restoration efforts. By integrating research and education the project will enhance undergraduate education through hands on research experiences and encourage broader participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. To achieve these goals the project will, create summer research positions for college students from underrepresented groups, develop an exciting inquiry based laboratory that will introduce students to forest ecology through engaging them in actual field research, and  conduct short-term summer classes for K-12 students from local public schools',\n",

The current 20 year old instrument has developed electrical problems and suffers from unreliable background stability. The manufacturer of the current instrument has since gone out of business and no support options are available. The requested upgrade will be capable of general powder X-ray diffraction, micro-diffraction, and wide angle X-ray scattering. Also proposed is a 2-D image plate detector system. XRD is a common technique for studying Earth and extraterrestrial materials. The research team will put the requested instrument into service to 1) better understand mineralogical signals indicative of supporting life found in Earth and planetary samples, 2) better understand rock-water interactions through mineral signatures, 3) determine biosignatures in Earth and planetary rocks, 4) understand the role of microbes in mediating redox reactions in Fe-bearing clays and Fe-oxides in addition to U(IV) mineral formation and redox processes in the subsurface, and 5) quantitatively survey clay, carbonate and feldspar/quartz mineralology in glacial tills, eolian sediments, and lacustrine deposits in order to reconstruct paleoclimatic changes. The new instrument will be housed in current X-ray Diffraction Laboratory at UWM. Current infrastructure (cooling water, AC, power, distilled water, etc) is in place to support the acquisition. A 50%-time XRD lab manager will support operation and is supervised by the PI. The lab manager will train new users, provide tech support, maintain the XRD and associated instruments, develop techniques and keep general records. A first-come, first-serve web-based sign up system is in place for the current instrument and will continue to be used. Users pay an hourly fee.

The Education Alliance at Brown University, which will evaluate the project, is a supporting partner together with the Community College of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation and the Concord Consortium. Rhode Island Technology Enhanced Science (RITES) is based upon structural reform initiated with the support of the Governor. An action plan developed by a PK-16 council resulted in an investment of $15 million to establish a permanent STEM Center that features two new tenure track positions and will provide support to all schools.  The comprehensive statewide STEM education reform also has support from all levels of government and academia and RITES represents a valuable experiment in organization and structure within that effort.  The RITES project will, in five years of NSF funding, transform the quality of science teaching and learning at all secondary schools, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of students who are proficient in science and pursue careers in Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM).  The heart of the project is the seamless integration of all segments of the Rhode Island educational community (i.e., teachers and school systems, higher education science departments and schools of education, the various state offices that monitor and support STEM education and the private sector). RITES will impact all 686 middle school and high school teachers and all of their 83,339 students with excellent, challenging, computer-based, standards-aligned, science materials.  Pairs of high schools and feeder middle schools will join the Partnership together by developing a unified, comprehensive, middle and high school science action plan that will integrate RITES resources, for professional development of teachers and materials for students, with school needs and ongoing school reform.  Schools that participate in the project will be expected to have the active engagement of the school leadership and at least 75% of the science teachers.  Teachers will attend short courses not only to deepen their content knowledge and pedagogy but also to learn how to customize the newly designed curricular materials for their own classrooms. The comprehensive evaluation plan will include annual reviews of the New England Common Assessments Program (NECAP) science assessment,which will be administered for the first time in Spring 2008.  Results will be disaggregated by race, gender and disabilities and income.

Key to this Teacher Institute project is working with teachers and districts to retain new and continuing teachers in the field and develop leadership capacity.  The Partners will develop and implement a Master's degree in Secondary Mathematics, and a Teacher Leadership Program in mathematics for teachers, grades 4-12.  Research is to be carried out on the impact of both these programs on student achievement.The Master's program (32 credit hours) will support 4 cohorts of 15-18 teachers per year and the Teacher Leadership program (24 credit hours) will support 3 cohorts of 10-12 teachers per year, over the five year project.  The courses will be a combination of face- to-face and on-line delivery.  More than 95,000 students from grades 4 through 12 are potentially impacted over the life of the project: 23,700 directly by teacher enrolled in the master's program and 71, 000 students of teachers who will work with Teacher Leaders. An intensive recruitment program is planned to attract teachers from Native American school districts in Colorado (Southern Ute Indian Reservation and Ute Mountain Indian Reservation) and Wyoming (the Wind River Reservation).The research program will study the impact of professional development (PD) on teachers' mathematical understanding, pedagogical content knowledge and cultural competencies for teaching diverse students in Colorado and Wyoming.  The study will track teacher change and its effect on student achievement, grades 6-12, and will advance knowledge of teacher leadership development through a quantitative design experiment of the leadership model proposed by the project. The transformative concept in Math TLC is the development of the online master's degree shared jointly by the Universities of Northern Colorado and Wyoming in combination with a leadership program.  Success will require substantive institutional affiliation and will transform PD for isolated rural teachers by providing significant mathematics content integrated with culturally informed pedagogical methods, by creating master teachers and teacher-leaders that have the expertise to intellectually engage underserved groups.The comprehensive dissemination plan includes a web portal for the online distribution of research and implementation outcomes, publications of findings in peer reviewed journals and presentations at regional and national meetings.

       " \"TECHNICAL: This is an SGER project focused on energy/entropy transport in nanostructured conductors. PI plans to investigate electronic transmission through constrictions, under ballistic conditions and with an applied non-homogeneous magnetic field, of charge carriers that have orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Heat removed at contacts that can potentially be used for cooling/power generation, would be evaluated by measuring the Seebeck coefficient. The project is inspired by the thermodynamic process of adiabatic demagnetization that is the basis of a successful cooling technology and the process that PI aims to demonstrate can be denominated 'adiabatic demagnetization in a wire'. The project is experimental. The nanostructures are made of bismuth, antimony, and their alloys because these semimetals exhibit low intrinsic dissipation. To fabricate the samples, PI will employ a high pressure, high-temperature injection technique that uses nanochannel dielectrics as a template structure to fabricate dense and massive composites consisting of arrays or networks of bismuth constrictions with controllable diameters in the range of 100 nm to 1 um. These materials are organized in devices, featuring a source of inhomogeneous field, which will also be fabricated. Measurements of the energy/entropy transport will be performed in these devices. Estimates show great prospects. PI's theoretical model of energy/entropy transport, that considers both phonon and electron mean-free-paths, show that transfer peaks for nanostructure characteristic sizes of around 500 nm. The estimated efficiency is close to the Carnot efficiency at low temperatures (4 kelvin). By using materials that have extraordinarily long electronic mean free paths (namely bismuth) shaped into nanosize structures of characteristic sizes smaller than the mean free path the project explores, in solid state materials, electronic phenomena traditionally observed in vacuum electronics. The project also aims to impact the field of magnetism in nanostructures, that is closely related to the field of spintronics because the mechanisms of transfer of magnetic polarization will be explored. NON-TECHNICAL: The research impacts the field of solid-state thermal-to-electric conversion, thermoelectrics and thermoionics. These processes involve neither mechanical parts that wear down nor fluorocarbons that damage the environment and solid state coolers and generators can be miniaturized for use in miniature sensors and actuators. This project includes a strong educational component, emphasizing the participation of undergraduate students in the research program.

       " '0843798MusteThe PI proposes to better understand and refine river discharge estimates using improved measures of rating curves. Traditional river discharge estimates are conducted at times when flow is relatively normal and steady, allowing safe and convenient measurement. These measurements serve as the basis for calculating rating curves. The curves, in turn, are used to estimate flow and discharge during flood events ? possibly leading to significant uncertainty due to hysteresis. Understanding the discharge-flow hysteresis relationship requires measurements during high flow events. The 2008 Midwestern flood offers a unique opportunity to couple flow and discharge measurements in order to better understand and model rating curve hysteresis during extreme events. With the goal of coupling river stage and discharge, measurements will be made in a non-contact manner developed at IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering which uses Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV). This technique was initiated on June 10, 2008. Funds are requested to 1) finalize the on-going measurements; 2) perform topographic and bathymetric surveys; 3) evaluate deployed instruments by conducting baseline flow measurements; 4) analyze data and report findings; and 5) produce conceptual process models and define future research needs. The unique aspect of the proposed research is the use of non-intrusive measurement techniques in a natural extreme event provided by the 2008 Midwestern flood. The series of measurements will allow the PI to assess the technique and its ability to provide improved rating curve estimates under rare unsteady flow situations in natural channels. The expectation is that LSPIV will provide a simple, compact, cost- and effort-effective package for providing these critical measurements. Unsteady flows will be investigated in detail and conceptual frameworks will be developed in order to determine what ancillary data are needed to answer discharge hypotheses. The transformative, exploratory nature of this project will provide field testing for technical aspects of the LSPIV technique to include specular reflection for free-surface tracing, optimal velocity distribution laws in the water column testing as a function of stream characteristics, flood wave raising and falling data capture, and uncertainty analysis. Rating curves are the basis of stream stage measurements, yet their uncertainty during high-flow events obviates the ability to fully understand unsteady fluvial processes. River processes hypotheses regarding extreme and unusual flow regimes can be tested and the results of this study will enable river stage and discharge estimation in regions without gauging stations. Integrated hydrologic-geomorphic-biological studies will be possible through a better understanding of key temporal and spatial processes in flood propagation. Uncertainty in rating curves calculated during stable river flow regimes will hinder flood stage forecasting whereas this project will provide data useable by national mission agencies for more accurate flood estimates. With billions of dollars lost each year, more accurate flood data are timely and of broad interest',\n",

       " 'The six micro-satellite Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) was launched on April 14, 2006 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. All satellites and payloads are functioning well, and the program began distributing all data to all interested parties three months after launch in late July 2006. The program was executed within budget and schedule and the high-quality data are already starting to significantly affect atmospheric and ionospheric science and operational weather forecasting. Following several months of testing, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) commenced operational use of the COSMIC data on December 13, 2006. Several operational centers, including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UK Met Office), Météo-France, and the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) plan to begin operational assimilation of COSMIC data in early 2007. As of January 2007, there are 400 registered users of the data, representing major U.S. and international universities, leading operational weather centers, research laboratories, and several private companies. The status of the spacecraft and data processing center can be found at the COSMIC web site: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/ The COSMIC satellites are designed to last for at least five years. While the satellites are expected to operate through 2011, the U.S. component of this joint Taiwan-U.S. program is only funded until November 2007. The operation of the remote tracking stations (RTS) is funded only through April 2008, per a service agreement with a private company, Universal Space Network (USN). This proposal seeks additional funding from the NSF and other participating U.S. agencies to continue the program to cover the entire 5-year expected lifetime of the satellite constellation, through September 30, 2011. While Taiwan will continue to operate the constellation, the US contribution is critical to ensure continued delivery of the data and data products. The main tasks to be performed with US funding are: (i) operation of the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) for data processing, quality control, and dissemination, (ii) continued development and improvement of processing algorithms, (iii) assumption of 50% of the cost for the operation of the COSMIC RTS for near-real time data collection, (iv) continued improvement and maintenance of Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) science payload firmware and software, and (v) operation of the COSMIC Project Office to support the national and international science community. Intellectual Merit: This project has extremely high intellectual merit in that it will make use of innovative GPS RO techniques to provide global, continuous, and all-weather observations of the atmosphere for research and operations. COSMIC delivers two major advancements in GPS RO science: (i) the design and implementation of an advanced  open-loop  tracking technique for space-based sensing of the atmospheric boundary layer and (ii) the design and operation of first constellation that produces real-time RO soundings with uniform global coverage to support atmospheric research and operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), climate monitoring and research, and space-weather forecasting. Broader Impacts: With the availability of ~2,500 soundings globally per day, COSMIC will have a broad and far-reaching impact for the operational and research atmospheric science communities. COSMIC will provide valuable data in traditional data sparse regions of the world, including polar and oceanic regions, for weather and climate studies. The fact that the COSMIC data are of high precision, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution, are not affected by clouds and precipitation, and require no inter-satellite cross-calibration, makes COSMIC ideally suited for climate research. COSMIC also provides much-needed ionospheric observations for analysis and forecasting of space weather, and other ionospheric research. The COSMIC data and the processing software will be made freely available to the broad university and user community. The project also has a significant educational component, as it will involve graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows through collaboration with universities',\n",

       " \"This research group proposes that blind thrust faults in the core of growing anticlines exhibit variable slip at 10,000 to 100,000 year time scales and that this slip is rooted in crustal-scale processes of stress transfer among faults responding to climatically-driven processes at the Earth?s surface. Studies along the mountain front of the northern Apennines, Italy will delineate the slip history of two related, but physically disconnected faults at a approximately 20,000 year resolution over a five million year Pliocene - Recent time span. Because this record of fault slip coincides with the well-known large amplitude oscillations in global climate that contribute to the filling and deformation of the Po foreland, the team further hypothesizes that the 100,000 year, and potentially 40,000 year climatic cycles will be reflected in observed slip rates as faults are differentially lubricated by changing ground water conditions, sea-level and structural emergence, and differentially loading by the redistribution of sediment at the surface. The project will employ cyclostraigraphy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization calibrated to accurate models of Earth's orbital motions, which constitutes a high-resolution metronome with a precision, accuracy and continuity that outperforms modern radioisotope geochronology, magnetostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy and transcends the problems of resolution and length of record that have limited GPS and paleoseismic approaches. Fault slip unsteadiness with a periodicity in line with known climatic cycles at 40,000-100,000 year time spans will prove the hypothesis.Knowledge of fault slip rate variation on a fault with 10,000-100,000 year resolution has important geodynamic, and seismic hazard implications particularly for the case of blind thrust faults that can generate significant earthquakes, such as the 2008 Los Angeles basin earthquakes. Similar kinds of earthquakes resulting from blind thrust faults are well documented for the northern Apennine (Italy) mountain front, home to 4 million residents where deformation rates and seismic hazards remain poorly defined. Here spatial and temporal gaps in earthquake activity are considered as places where damaging earthquakes do not or will not occur. This research suggests that such gaps are simply the result of fault slip unsteadiness and aims to determine a cause for the unsteadiness by studying the geologic record\",\n",
       " \"Intellectual Merit: Northeastern University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, and the University of Wyoming will partner in a research study designed to investigate the hypothesis that women's participation in formal undergraduate engineering programs that provide work experiences while enrolled (e.g., cooperative education or internships), leads to enhanced self-efficacy and an increased likelihood of retention through graduation. Although all four schools offer cooperative education or internship programs, Northeastern University and Rochester Institute of Technology require them. Using a variety of survey research tools, this project seeks to isolate those factors and experiences that contribute most to the development of positive self-efficacy beliefs and, ultimately, to the retention of women in undergraduate engineering programs. The role of self-efficacy will be examined and compared to other factors in order to develop a model that demonstrates how demographic variables, work experiences, contextual supports, and three dimensions of self-efficacy (work, academic, and career) interact to predict retention. Self-efficacy theory has been used to explain the career development of women, especially in male-dominated careers such as engineering. Self-efficacy beliefs are considered the primary cognitive determinants of behavior, including whether a behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long behavior will be sustained in the face of obstacles. This research will expand the existing knowledge base about the role of work experiences and self-efficacy for women in undergraduate engineering programs by addressing the following hypotheses: - Self-efficacy is the principal predictor of retention of women in undergraduate engineering programs.- Cooperative education and internships, as formal work experience features of undergraduate programs, constitute a critical predictor of women?s retention directly and indirectly through their impact on self-efficacy. - Contextual support variables affect work, career, and academic self-efficacy as well as retention both directly and indirectly through self-efficacy. - Demographic variables have an independent effect on retention but also interact with contextual variables and with self-efficacy to indirectly affect retention. Data will be collected using a survey instrument featuring a work self-efficacy inventory.  Each school will gather accurate retention figures by tracking individual student files instead of institutional methods that tend to use a  black box  approach of comparing the number of students entering in with the number of students graduating. The data will be analyzed using regression and path analyses to determine how the variables interact to predict retention. Broader Impacts: This study will have wide-ranging implications for undergraduate engineering programs. The resulting model will enable university administrators to discriminate among a variety of program supports, such as work experience and advising programs, and their relationship to retention. Many engineering colleges already offer cooperative education and internship programs but have little data about the impact of these programs or how to leverage them. This research provides a unique way to connect gender and self-efficacy theory to undergraduate engineering programs while addressing the critical student outcomes of efficacy (especially work self-efficacy) and degree attainment\",\n",

       " 'Intellectual Merit     Filamentous fungi are the primary degraders of plant cellulosic material in the environment.  Different species of filamentous fungi are associated with the roots of almost all plant species in a symbiotic relationship that allows plants to gain micronutrients from soil.  In addition, other species are disease causing agents in plants, or cause important human diseases.  All of these filamentous fungi, both beneficial and pathogenic species, grow by tip extension, branching and hyphal fusion to form a hyphal network.  The formation of the hyphal network is believed to be essential for transfer of nutrients throughout ecosystems by root associated and saprophytic fungi and for colony establishment and exploitation of resources in pathogenic fungi.  Although tip growth and branching have been extensively studied in filamentous fungi, little is known about the mechanism of hyphal fusion or the function of the hyphal network.  Live cell imaging and genetic analysis of hyphal fusion in the model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa have revealed that the process of hyphal fusion is a complex and carefully regulated biological process.  A large number of components essential for hyphal fusion have been identified in N. crassa, including components of signal transduction pathways, polarization components, filamentous fungal specific proteins and transmembrane proteins.  Hyphal fusion mutants show developmental defects, in addition to slower growth rates and/or lag phase to reach maximal growth rate.  These observations indicate that the formation of an interconnected network in filamentous fungi is essential for both exploitation of an environmental niche and for developmental processes.  The objectives of this research are to dissect the process of germling/hyphal fusion using a combination of live cell imaging, genetic analysis and biochemical tools to elucidate the mechanisms of self-signaling, polarization and membrane merger with the ultimate goal of understanding the role of hyphal networks in ecosystems, symbiosis and pathogenesis. Broader Impact:Hyphal fusion in filamentous fungi is comparable to cell fusion events between genetically identical cells in other organisms, such as cell-cell fusion resulting in syncytia, such as myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation, trophoblast fusion during placental development and between osteoclasts during bone formation. Thus, studying cell-cell fusion in N. crassa provides a useful model for understanding molecular mechanisms of cell fusion events in more complex eukaryotic species.

Fractional calculus allows us to write differential equations of particle fluxes that incorporate, simply and directly, broad-tailed probability distributions of grain size, single particle hops and storage times on the bed.  It does so by providing differential operators of fractional order, which means that changes in model variables are calculated regionally or non-locally, rather than at a point in space or time as in classical calculus.

Lemke, Wayne State University In the face of growing U.S. population in the 21st century, reliable numerical flow and transport models are essential tools for managing groundwater resources in expanding urbanized areas. The development of such models is particularly challenging in glaciated regions where depositional complexities make it difficult to predict the detailed three dimensional distributions of hydrostratigraphic units that control local scale groundwater flow and contaminant transport. This research project will apply alternative methods to model the spatial variability of physical attributes and quantify uncertainty in predicted groundwater flow and solute transport within an urban glacial aquifer system.  Allostratigraphic correlation methods will be used to identify bounding surfaces and define the gross hydrostratigraphic architecture. Subsequently, geostatistical methods will be used to model smaller scale variability within the allostratigraphic correlation units.  It is postulated that such hybrid models of aquifer variability will define a wider range of uncertainty in groundwater flow and contaminant transport predictions than that established by varying aquifer parameters or boundary conditions within a single, most-likely deterministic aquifer model.  Uncertainty associated with alternative deterministic and stochastic conceptual models will also be assessed.  The results of this research are expected to demonstrate that predictive uncertainty cannot be adequately quantified using a single deterministic geologic model. As a further outcome of the research activities, it is expected that hybrid deterministic and stochastic models will enjoy more frequent application and, as a consequence, our ability to predict and quantify uncertainties in the movement of contaminants through highly heterogeneous aquifer systems will improve. The research will be conducted at Wayne State University, a prominent urban research institution serving 33,000 students, located in a glaciated region with an expanding metropolitan area and a long history of industrial activity. The accompanying Education Plan will strengthen the Environmental Science Program at Wayne State while training a new generation of students (including underrepresented minorities) with the critical skills needed to build hybrid numerical models of heterogeneous aquifer systems. Because Wayne State?s undergraduate student body consists of 37% minority students (33% African-American), this project will impact a diverse cross-section of students. A combination of field trips, peer mentoring, and learning communities will be used to attract and retain underrepresented minority students to the Geology and Environmental Science Programs. In addition, approximately 1,000 general education students and 20 to 30 Geology and Environmental Science majors will be exposed to problem-based learning activities associated with the proposed research each year. By helping to bridge the gap of minority under-representation in science, this project will help meet the growing U.S. demand for science and engineering graduates',\n",
       " 'Unlike current telecommunications based on electrical or optical signals, the biological communications technology uses chemical signals as carriers of information. This technology exhibits various distinct features such as biocompatibility and energy-efficiency, potentially enabling new Bio-ICT (Information and Communications Technology) applications that are not likely achieved by current silicon-based technology. For example, molecular communication can be applied to biocompatible information systems in which implanted biological devices chemically interact with tissues and organs in the human body. It is also applicable to unconventional information systems in which biological cells chemically coordinate to grow into a three dimensional structure that functions as information processing and storage systems.In this project, the investigator is exploring biological cells and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms. The specific objectives in this project are fourfold; (1) design and engineering of system components - designing, engineering and characterizing necessary building blocks of molecular communication systems (e.g., repeaters and switches), (2) system integration - developing a microplatform that can integrate independent components into a working system, (3) application designs - demonstrating novel applications using an integrated molecular communication system, and (4) establishment of information theory - addressing the theoretical basis such as channel capacity and coding mechanisms of molecular communication. The project is expected to provide new insights and findings into science and engineering. It examines how information is communicated, processed and stored in biological systems from a communication and engineering view point, which may help enhance current engineering principles as well as advance bio-inspired information technology. It is also expected to address a number of unanswered questions on design principles of biological systems',\n",

F. Wheeler,T. Arbogast, and M. Delshad of the Center for Subsurface Modelingand I. Duncan from the Bureau of Economic Geology  at TheUniversity of Texas at Austin, as well as M. Parashar ofthe Applied Software Systems Laboratory at Rutgers University.

We will provide training in the use of a sophisticated groundwatersimulator, to be used as a tool to engage and pique the interest ofhigh schoolers, perhaps leading some to careers in mathematics, thesciences, and interdisciplinary work.  In addition, two postdoctoralstudents and roughly two graduate students will be supportedthroughout the project.Geologic sequestration is a proven means of permanent CO2 greenhouse gasstorage, but it is difficult to design and manage such efforts.  Predictivecomputational simulation may be the only means to account for the lack ofcomplete characterization of the subsurface environment, the multiple scales ofthe various interacting processes, the large areal extent of saline aquifers,and the need for long time predictions.  This proposal will investigate highfidelity multiscale and multiphysics algorithms necessary for simulation ofmultiphase flow and transport coupled with geochemical reactions and relatedmineralogy, and geomechanical deformation in porous media to predict changes inrock properties during sequestration.

       " \"Grassland degradation is a global concern, affecting not only wild species and pastoralists who rely on healthy grasslands for their survival, but also non-local people who suffer from resultant hydrological disturbances, dust storms, commodity scarcity, and social consequences of uprooted people.  Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population.  Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded.  Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife.  Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors.  As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness.  This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses.  The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments.  In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified.  Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face.  These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists.  The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status.  Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental.  Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide.  In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials.  Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers.  Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.

       " 'Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) provides a universal theory of the properties of condensed matter.  This theory, for which W. Kohn received the 1998 Nobel Prize, has revolutionized practical calculations.  Nevertheless, the theory is based on an average, non-interacting description, and ultimately fails at long time scales.  Thus one of the challenges of modern theoretical physics is to develop methods that go beyond this average picture.  A practical solution would be transformative.  Our multi-disciplinary project addresses this challenge by exploiting real-time approaches.   Specifically we will use a combination of real-time DFT and explicit treatments of additional degrees of freedom such as collective coordinates and atomic positions, which are appropriate for problems in materials science and nuclear physics.  Such dynamic approaches naturally mix configurations, and provide a common framework for treating long-time behavior in various applications.  Though the above extensions are currently computationally demanding, they are likely feasible with expected increases in computer power, together with theoretical and algorithmic advances made possible by the CDI.  The broader impacts of a successful methodology are of considerable theoretical and practical importance.   For example, going beyond Kohn-Sham DFT could likely enable new discoveries ranging from nuclear structure and reactions to technology including electronics, photonics, and catalysis.  In addition, the focus on computational techniques will bring advanced computer science methods, computer codes, and high performance computational methods into theoretical physics and materials science, and will help train a new generation of scientists',\n",
       " \"Scientists and supporters of science have long worked to improve the sharing, reuse, storage, and retrieval of scientific data.  Today, efforts focus on advanced  cyberinfrastructure : using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines.  Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth's climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data.  Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making.  Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats.  For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge.  To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework.  In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory.  These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science.  In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis.  In addition to published findings, the project will produce a 'best practices' handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure.  The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development.  The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure\",\n",
       " \"Geometric topology was once a fringe topic, well studied in graduate schools but almost unknown in mainstream culture. Happily, in recent years public interest has increased. The key to effectively presenting geometric topology to a broad audience is to keep in mind that explanations using words alone are sure to fail.  Explanations using pictures will convey a vague sense of the intended meaning. But to deeply understand the topology of a multi-connected space, the learner must experience the space for him or herself. One of the P.I.'s missions in life --- and the subject of the present project --- is to provide computer software that enables children and other non-specialists to experience 2-manifolds, 3-manifolds, and other structures directly. For example, the P.I.'s existing Torus Games have already proved effective with students from fifth grade on up, leading them to the mind-stretching concept of multiconnected spaces (specifically, the flat 2-torus and the flat Klein bottle). The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include spherical and hyperbolic 2-manifolds as well as 3-manifolds.While mathematicians' and physicists' understanding of space has made tremendous progress, the general public's understanding still lags behind.  Part of the reason is that, while the modern concept of space is not inherently difficult to understand, it is extremely difficult to explain in words. Explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate.  The only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp a new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself.  The P.I.'s existing Torus Games software lets students develop a gut-level understanding of spaces that are finite yet have no boundaries;  this software is widely used in middle and high schools and is effective with students from fifth grade on up.  The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include curved spaces as well as flat ones, and 3-dimensional spaces as well as  toy  2-dimensional ones.  Cosmologists are currently investigating the hypothesis that the real universe might be finite, but no matter whether that hypothesis is ultimately accepted or rejected, spaces of all sorts (flat and curved, finite and infinite, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) play a pervasive role throughout physics and mathematics, and merit a broader understanding in our culture as a whole\",\n",
       " \"This award supports theoretical research and education on spin ordering and transport in correlated electronic and atomic systems. The PI will investigate problems in the collective spin physics of correlated electron materials and Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms with nonzero spin. The research is divided into three subfields: spin transport phenomena related to the new class of materials called ''topological insulators''; quantum effects on the phase ordering and coherent dynamics of spinor Bose condensates; applications of quantum information ideas to improved characterization and simulation of frustrated magnets. In each of these subfields, the research builds on the PI?s work performed under prior NSF support. The key elements in the first research area are to understand how correlation physics is modified in a topological insulator and to describe three dimensional topological insulators in greater depth. In the second area, the PI studies effects of topological defects and dipolar interactions on the quantum theory of Bose condensates with spin, as these are believed to be essential for the interpretation of experiments. In the third area, the research tests specific proposals for DMRG-like algorithms in dimension greater than one on frustrated magnetic models of current experimental interest.The work has broader impact beyond the specific research investigations including education and relevance to emerging device technologies.   The work on spin transport in solids is currently of great interest in the applied semiconductor community, and devices using the quantum nature of electron spin are in development.  The research is relevant to ideas of future use of spinor Bose condensates as ultrasensitive magnetic field detectors with spatial resolution finer than in the best existing devices with applications beyond MRI devices. Scientifically, improved algorithms to find ground states of local Hamiltonians are important  in many areas of physics. This award has educational befits, the first being support of graduate students who will use the research as the basis for the Ph.D. Dissertation.

The phenomena are not unrelated to magnetism which also is connected to the intrinsic electron spin.  The phenomena have been observed, but the theoretical explanation is less clear and the research seeks to clarify physical mechanisms and thereby add to the ability to control and utilize the phenomenon in device technology. Eventually, this may be the basis of electronic logic devices that are orders of magnitude faster and more efficient that the current transistor technology based on charge movement and charge accumulation.The work has broader impact beyond the specific research investigations including education and relevance to emerging device technologies.

       " 'This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization. Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services',\n",

It examines the period of time between A.D. 1200 to 1550, when there were massive displacements of population that coincided with the formation of large, aggregated villages throughout the area. Using information culled from unpublished and published reports, museum collections, and limited archaeological fieldwork it supplements an existing database of known Native American settlements in the region that was developed with prior NSF funding. The project has five major goals. First is to add material culture information (especially ceramics and obsidian) to an existing GIS that contains only spatial data developed by the Center for Desert Archaeology. This GIS database includes roughly 2000 late prehispanic sites across the Southwest. Second is to characterize the structure and dynamics of social networks in the area during a period of great population flux and pan-regional interconnectivity. The third is to apply new methods and theories of social network analysis from sociology, Geographic Information System (GIS), physics, and mathematics to archaeology. Fourth, researchers are to test current theories about network structure and change using high-resolution archaeological data. And fifth, the researchers are to integrate social network theory with powerful tools of spatial analyses such as GIS. Southwest archaeology has the potential to provide a  deep time  perspective on the rise and fall of social networks within a relatively controlled and circumscribed environment. Social network analysis has largely concentrated on contemporary examples and this is the first application of social network theory and methods to a regional archaeological database that measures change over centuries and that is more analogous to the kinds of interactions that take place in many non-urban settings throughout the world. Project results are presented in a manner accessible to the public in variety of media, including the Center for Desert Archaeology?s website, public lectures, and widely distributed publications',\n",

Using graph theory and efficient combinatorial searches, new hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be discovered. Their physical properties will be calculated and their likely usefulness for particular molecular interactions will be evaluated. Tools to assist the synthesis of particular frameworks, such as template identification, will be developed. A searchable interactive database of hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be openly available online. Users will be able to explore the physical properties of zeolites and to upload molecular shapes to find the best- matched pores. In addition, users who have synthesized a new material will be able to upload a powder diffraction pattern to find the best match, thereby accelerating the structure-solution of unknown materials. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (and filtered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization. This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures.Layperson's abstractZeolites are arguably one of the most useful classes of materials.  Their structures contain crystalline arrays of pores and open channels that are wide enough to allow small molecules such as water and light oil molecules to enter and leave. In addition, their chemical composition allows them to behave as solid acids. Because of these useful properties, zeolites are used extensively in the petrochemical industry, and there is significant effort to synthesize new zeolites with different absorption properties. Currently, the rate of discovery of new zeolites is slow, being done, essentially, through trial and error.This project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Hypothetical useful zeolites will be predicted by mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, and their physical properties will be computed in order to identify the potentially useful ones.

       " \"The project proposed for this Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant is an important part of Giovanni Valente's dissetation, titled  Locality and Non-Separability in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory.  The requested amount of funding ($3000 in total) is intended to support a two-month visit to the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University, where the student will work under Prof. Hans Halvorson, who is also the co-director of Giovanni's dissertation, together with Prof. Jeffrey Bub (University of Maryland). Specifically, the goal of the research to be conducted in Princeton is to construct an algebraic formulation of Jarrett's decomposition of Bell's inequalities, isolating two conditions, called parameter independence and outcome independence. Such conditions will be then generalized to Quantum Field Theory and their close relation to the concepts of locality and separability will be discussed. Moreover, a paper published by Halvorson together with Clifton in 2001, which proves that in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory one cannot perform any local operation that destroys entanglement correlations between two spatially separated systems, will be further developed and connected to the other results of the dissertation. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the intrinsic non-separability of quantum field theory.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity consists in the attempt of clarifying the notions of locality and correlations between spatially separated systems, which have been largely discussed in Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, but have not been explored enough in detail in the context of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory. In particular, the literature on the topic lacks any re-formulation in algebraic terms of Jarrett's decomposition of the Bell's inequalities. Furthermore, the concept of (non-)separability has not received a rigorous formalization in the context of quantum field theory. Given the highly technical nature of the subject, the work is of interest not only for philosophy of physics, but also for mathematical physics. In fact, we intend to submit the resulting research papers to journals in both fields.   As to the broader impacts of the proposed activity, the plan is to disseminate the results of the research accomplished by Valente under the supervision of Prof. Halvorson through talks and presentations at various meetings and conferences on foundations of physics as well as on philosophy of science. It is in this spirit that one should understand one of the major objectives of the entire dissertation. That is offering a simplified discussion of the structure of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, so that its mathematical details, as well as the relevant philosophical issues, could be made accessible even to those who do not have a particularly sophisticated technical background\",\n",
       " \"To sustainably meet the simultaneous and growing demands for water, energy, and environmental quality while protecting the welfare and tradition of affected communities, a broader view of dams is needed.  To address this need, this interdisciplinary research project will apply a new tool for evaluating the relative costs and benefits of dam construction based on multi-objective planning techniques. The Integrative Dam Assessment Modeling (IDAM) tool is designed to integrate biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives into a single cost/benefit analysis of dam construction.  Each of 27 different impacts of dam construction will be evaluated both objectively (e.g., flood protection) and subjectively (i.e., the valuation of said flood protection) by a team of decision makers.  By providing a visual representation of the costs and benefits associated with two or more dams, the IDAM tool will allow decision makers to evaluate alternatives and to articulate priorities associated with a dam project, making the decision process more informed and more transparent.  The IDAM tool will be an evolutionary step in dam evaluation.  Coupled with event chronologies and hotspot mapping of conflicts, household surveys, public-participatory geographic information systems, and hydrologic modeling, the proposed process will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding the assessment, minimization, and distribution of hydropower impacts across cultural and organizational levels and to engage stakeholders in the design process through a decision theater.Significant intellectual contributions of this project will include the use of a uniquely multidisciplinary, integrative model to understand the effects of dams through a controlled study of a complex social and environmental system in China.  The project will make several pragmatic contributions related to policy and decision making through disciplinary and interdisciplinary investigation.  The project therefore will increase understanding about the interplay of multiple impacts of dam construction in a variety of geographic contexts.  Because this collaborative effort will includes opportunities for research in undergraduate institutions, this project will support high-quality research by faculty members at two undergraduate institutions and encourage the integration of research and education.  Substantial coordination and capacity building will occur across organizations, levels of experience, and disciplines.  A broad dissemination strategy is aimed at strengthening research, teaching, and public outreach about society environment interactions in the U.S., Asia, and elsewhere.  Finally, this decision-support process will yield both new knowledge and accessible tools for improving institutions' ability to manage the social and environmental dynamics associated with dams as agents of change.

This project addresses this knowledge gap by assembling a major new dataset and then uses the tools of the social and behavioral sciences to develop and test models that predict which political organizations are most likely to use terrorist violence to pursue goals.This project generates interdisciplinary insights into the behavior of political organizations as a function of local, national, and international political, social, and economic variables, as well as organizational characteristics. It accomplishes this by analyzing terrorist organization behavior as part of a larger social ecology. The project involves a partnership of more than 15 researchers from 3 major research universities and represents a range of academic disciplines, all of whom share a substantive interest in the dynamics of human behavior. Political scientists, criminologists, and sociologists collaborate to construct integrated models of organizational behavior that take into account the broadly defined context in which an organization operates, building upon existing theories and concepts about social mobilization, political violence, and criminal gang behavioral dynamics. Moreover, computer scientists on our research team provide insights on how information extraction tools can most efficiently classify data to determine if it meets key conditions. Computer scientists and social scientists work together to develop optimal protocols for combining automated and non-automated data-collection efforts specific to the topic of politically active organizations. The combination of these processes allows for transformative research into the dynamics of terrorism, pushing well beyond current theoretical and methodological boundaries.The impact of the data, methods and analyses resulting from this project extends beyond the academic community to the policy realm. The core question?under what conditions does an organization turn to terrorism to pursue its political and social agenda??is of fundamental importance to governments around the world, and the research team assembled for this effort is well positioned to ensure that the knowledge gained from this effort is transferred to interested public officials. The research home for this project is the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a Center of Excellence of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, with a mandate and the mechanisms to ensure that advances made through this research are communicated directly to the policy community',\n",
       " 'CDI Type-I: Quantum Diffusion and Quantum RandomWalksin Physical SystemsAlexander Russell (PI), Robin C?ot´eUniversity of ConnecticutB. Project SummaryA shocking theoretical discovery of the late 90?s demonstrated that a computational apparatus directly harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics could dramatically outpace any classical computer for a number of important computational problems. This instigated a broad, ongoing effort both to implement such systems and to understand their full computational power.This project focuses on quantum random walks and quantum diffusion. Quantum random walks are important algorithmic tools appearing, for example, in the the most efficient known quantum algorithms for basic problems such as element distinctness (that is, the problem of determining if an element?such as a name or a number?appears twice in a long list) and evaluation of certain logic circuits. Quantum random walks are particularly attractive from the standpoint of implementation as they are presumably simpler to faithfully implement than a general purpose quantum computer. In particular, they possess a direct connection to quantum diffusion, an area of ultracold atomic physics. Our goal is to give the first rigorous analysis of a realistic quantum random walk and, thus, a clear indication of a candidate quantum system for implementing such walks.Intellectual merit. In this proposal, we intend to join forces of two new subfields of computer science and physics, namely quantum random walks (QRW) and ultracold atomic systems. More precisely, we will explore how the tools developed to investigate quantum random walks in simple models can be adapted to more realistic situations corresponding to physical systems of interest. Conversely, we will study realistic physical systems that could be engineered to correspond to models solvable with quantum random walks.These two complementary approaches will lead to insight about the complex underlying behavior of systems where quantum diffusion is crucial. Additionally, a large class of systems in condensed matter physics andatomic, molecular, and optical physics ? such as high-temperature superconductors or quantum magnets ? are thought to be described by models, such as the Bose-Hubbard model or one of its many generalizations,where quantum diffusion plays a key role. We plan to explore how one can control such systems so that simplified experimental setups, such as ultracold Rydberg atoms or ultracold atom-ion mixtures, can be exploited to mimic the simple models where the solutions to quantum random walks (and thus quantumdiffusion) are known.Broader impacts. We will continue our successful training efforts via the REU program (we have introduced dozens of students to real research topics) and graduate research guidance. Additionally, the PIs will develop and teach a multidisciplinary course entitled ?Quantum information and computation.?Within KAST (Kids Are Scientists Too), a 5-day program for 4th through 9th grade students, we will build new modules based on children?s fascination with technologies and computers. Additionally, the PIs will continue involvement in the DaVinci project, a program introducing high-school teachers to topics inengineering, mathematics, and physics that can be integrated into their high school science curricula.B-1',\n",

       " \"The Holocaust was a profoundly geographical event that caused mass displacement and migration, destroyed or fundamentally changed thousands of communities, and created hundreds of new places for the concentration of population, the exploitation of labor, and the mass murder of millions of people. Yet its spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics have scarcely been studied as explicitly geographical phenomena. Nor have scholars critically considered the complex and varied range of spatial scales at which the events constituting the Holocaust took place, from the individual body to the continental expanse of Europe. Through a partnership with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) and access to its exceptionally detailed datasets, the research team will build a set of GIS applications and geovisualizations to carry out four overlapping and interlinked case studies on (1) the evolution of the spatial system of concentration camps; (2) a comparative study of victim transports from France and Italy; (3) a localized study of forced evacuations or death marches from concentration camps at the end of WWII; and (4) a detailed study of the Budapest ghetto. These cases have been chosen for their suitability for GIScience modeling and analysis at a variety of scales and because they represent the range of spatial experiences of Holocaust victims (ghettoization, transportation, incarceration in the concentration camp system).This project will be the first systematic examination of the geographies of the Holocaust. Previous historical scholarship on the Holocaust has focused on Nazi policy, individual camps, particular atrocities, or the history of certain communities, groups, or nations. This project will take a synoptic view of the Holocaust as a multi-layered, multi-scaled event and analyze it by employing geographic information science (GIScience methodologies. For GIScience, the challenges posed by historical source data make this project a significant opportunity to advance new approaches to metadata and source interpretation. Our research methods will provide models for other scholars working in historical GIS as well.

Even fewer HGIS projects have examined historical events or conditions of major social significance.

       " \"CERN'S Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ranks among the top scientific endeavors of the decade.  Although predictions vary as to precisely what will be observed at this new energy frontier, theorists are in broad agreement that something new will be discovered.  The excitement surrounding this scientific opportunity has led to a sharp increase in the number of graduates seeking to pursue research at the LHC for their Ph.D dissertations.Because of the unprecedented scale and complexity of the LHC detectors, working on the commissioning of such detectors provides the students with a highly valuable experience which contributes to their education in ways that simply cannot be duplicated. Moreover, meaningful participation requires a physical presence at CERN. With the imminent turn-on of the LHC, the next few years provide a special window of opportunity. However, the combined effect of sharply increased student interest in the LHC, higher living costs in Geneva and the weakening of  the U.S. dollar, has made student support more problematic.

       " \"The physics of the interaction of intense laser light with plasma when wavelength-scale particles are irradiated is investigated. While the nature of strong field interactions with atoms, molecules, small clusters and planar solids has been studied extensively for many years, how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light?s wavelength is largely unexplored. These interactions are likely to exhibit properties which are quite distinct from the interactions of intense pulses with single atoms and molecules on one hand and large planar solid plasmas on the other. This work fills this gap in strong field physics with careful, well-designed experiments that isolate the effects which are peculiar to wavelength-scale targets. Previously, our investigations showed that strong field interactions could be enhanced by an appropriate choice of target particle size. Boundary conditions imposed by the particles create Mie enhancements in the local laser field and thereby increase the nonlinear response of the interaction. The specific focus of the current work is motivated by an important question that arose from our previous experimental and computation studies: is the nature of collisionless absorption by hot electrons around wavelength-scale plasmas different from collisionless absorption from a simple planar solid? A number of theories have recently surmised that such absorption is different at these scales, dominated by what has been termed multi-pass stochastic heating, in which hot electrons can absorb energy from the laser field by passing back and forth multiple times through the micron-scale plasma. This novel heating mechanism has been suggested as being important in a number of experiments and particle-in-cell simulations but there has as yet been no systematic experimental investigation. The current studies are designed to address this shortcoming. The experiments are designed to directly measure the electron and ion distributions generated in the collisionless heating process, and, by studying specific scalings in particles of well defined size, ascertain the importance or existence of this stochastic heating mechanism. The studies utilize a 20 TW, high temporal contrast laser at UT, electron and ion energy diagnostics, and a novel electrostatic particle injector as a target. These experiments are complemented by simulations using codes available at UT. The work is done through a unique collaboration between an academic research lab at the University of Texas and at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), an undergraduate institution. Application of these kinds of studies may aid in the development of novel bright, laser-driven x-ray sources for radiography and time resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging of other scientific applications. In addition to these scientific impacts, this collaborative work promises to make a significant and somewhat novel impactin graduate and undergraduate education. In addition to its scientific merit, and support of graduate student research at UT, this research significantly adds to the scope and number of research opportunities available to physics undergraduate students at HMC. This work represents a unique situation in which an undergraduate group is involved directly and in a critical way in larger scale strong field optics research, a field which is otherwise prohibitively resource intensive for undergraduate-level research alone. The PIs have an excellent record of working together and meaningfully involving undergraduates in their collaborations. Undergraduates have the opportunity to do research at HMC, travel to UT in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community. This collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seeking advanced degrees in science. Furthermore the PIs will continue to disseminate their work through publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and international conference as they have done actively during the past funding period.Funds for this award are provided by the Physics Division within the NSF's Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences of the DoE within the context of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering\",\n",

       " 'This project investigates the interplay of nonlinear dynamics and random abiotic fluctuations on distribution and abundance of interacting populations. To investigate this interplay, the theory of random dynamical systems which combines dynamical systems techniques with probabilistic machinery are applied to a class of random ecological maps sufficiently general to account for spatial structure, stage structure, and multispecies interactions. New mathematical methods for verifying stochastic dissipativeness, persistence, and extinction will be developed. The application of these methods to populations dispersing in random environments, the storage effect and the Allee effect in stage-structured populations, random replicator dynamics, and antagonistic interactions of ideal free populations in source-sink environments will be pursued. For models of structured populations, new methods will be developed for understanding monotonicity and convexity properties of the dominant Lyapunov exponent for parameterized families of random products of non-negative matrices. Since these dominant Lyapunov exponents determine the asymptotic growth rate of populations at low densities, they are critical for understanding persistence.The interaction between environmental fluctuations, for example those due to anthropogenic disturbances or weather, and biological processes can dramatically affect the outcomes of species interactions. Consequently, the applications of the mathematical techniques developed in this project may be of practical value to the conservation or the restoration of ecological communities, the prevention of biological invasions, the management of natural resources, and biological control of agricultural pests',\n",

This class of materials exhibit many interesting phenomena, for example, coupled structural transitions and collective electronic effects such as metal-insulator transitions, phase separation at low temperatures, and multiferroic behavior. This research collaboration intends to address the important issue of sample quality, which often leads to contradictory results; controlling sample quality is important to understand the manifestly different physical behavior. The specific objectives of the project include: synthesis and characterization of high quality samples of these complex oxides in both the US and Indian laboratories; determination of the electronic properties using photoelectron spectroscopies; measurement of local structure using x-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory; and generation of high impact scientific and technological results along with an understanding of many-body interactions using theoretical tools.  The results of these studies are expected to resolve several outstanding questions in this field and contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of these materials, which are promising candidates for potential applications in data manipulation and storage.

       " 'This award to University of California-Los Angeles by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to grow single crystals of Rhenium diboride (ReB2) and to measure the physical properties of ReB2 as a function of crystallographic orientation.  The hardness of ReB2 will then be enhanced by forming solid solutions and synthesizing dense nanocrystalline composites.  In other studies, rhenium will be replaced completely with other transition metals such as Titanium while maintaining the ReB2 structure type. These approaches may enable to construct new ultra-incompressible, superhard materials using less expensive metals. The search for new ultra-incompressible, superhard materials holds both scientific and practical interest.  The proposed design plan is to combine high valence electron density transition metals with small main group elements to replace the weak metallic bonds with strong covalent bonds. Using this approach, it is possible to convert relatively soft rhenium metal into an extremely hard Rhenium diboride, which has many exciting physical properties including low incompressibility, high hardness, and the ability to scratch diamond.  Synthesis and testing of coatings will be carried out in conjunction with a local company that specializes in developing ultra-hard coatings. Hardness, fracture toughness and Young?s modulus will be determined by indentation techniques. Radial diffraction experiments will also be used to determine the mechanical properties of these materials.  As part of this project, an outreach program be developed entitled ?It?s a Material World? that is suitable for both undergraduate students and general audiences.

       " \"The investigators study R&D environments where opportunities to invest are constrained by imagination as well as by resources. This simple and realistic premise has many implications for the design of intellectual property, as well as for other institutions that support R&D.First, since ideas for investments do not arrive simultaneously, there is a tradeoff between preserving options and the cost of delay. Investing early can preempt investments in better ideas that arrive later.  An incentive problem arises because a private recipient of an idea may not reap the social benefit of preserving options. This leads to the question of how to organize incentives so that recipients of ideas take account of social options.The investigators characterize a socially optimal threshold for accepting an idea rather than discarding it. The threshold is on the net social value. They prove that the threshold should become less discriminating as time passes without filling the market niche.  They then study how reward mechanisms can (or cannot) achieve that outcome. Patents are an imperfect tool because their private value cannot be tailored to R&D cost. Patent value does not scale with social value. In the special case where ideas differ only in the quality of the innovation, but not in R&D cost, patents will over-encourage low-cost ideas with low quality, and under-encourage high-value ideas that also have high cost. Prizes might do better, for example, when ideas differ only in their R&D costs. The prize should increase with delay. Second, because ideas must be compared in order to find the best one, it may be optimal to collect ideas, as venture capitalists do. The investigators illuminate the tension between the social benefits of allowing venture capitalists to collect and screen ideas, and the competitive goals of the patent system. They show that the optimal reward system must be more generous when ideas are aggregated in the hands of a few venture capitalists than when widely dispersed.Third, the scarcity of ideas explains the open-source movement in a new way.  In many arenas, there cannot be ideas for further advance unless previous technologies are disclosed. If ideas are scarce, the relevant disclosure cannot be accomplished under contract, because it is not known where the next idea will surface. The disclosure and sharing obligations of the open source community overcome this problem.Finally, the scarcity of ideas has implications for public funding. Unlike patents and prizes, public support can be given when the innovator actually needs it, which is before investing. However, giving the money in advance creates a problem for knowing which researchers to fund, especially when the researchers have different idiosyncratic ideas, and different idiosyncratic capabilities. The investigators characterize the optimal blend of pre-screening and experience rating, especially when it is understood that even good ideas may fail. The project brings economic theory into closer contact with the R&D experience of recent decades. For example, the scarcity of ideas should lead to economic profit, as it did in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, rather than to the profit dissipation predicted by patent races. The project's broader impact is on the design of programs for funding R&D\",\n",
       " 'Significance and importance of the project.  The initiation of earthquakes on faults in the Earth?s crust is controlled, incredibly, by physical processes that occur at microscopic contacts between rough surfaces of rock that touch along the fault.  Despite the success of empirical friction equations in describing the results of laboratory friction experiments and producing a variety of earthquake-related phenomena in computer models of earthquakes, these equations lack a physical basis.  That is, the precise identity and nature of the physical mechanisms that  occur at microscopic contacts, and give rise to the observed friction effects in experiments, remain unknown.  The empirical nature of the descriptions reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying the physical processes at microscopic fault contacts.  Without a sound physical understanding, we remain limited in our abilities to reliably apply the equations to earthquakes in nature, to obtain a better general understanding of the earthquake process, and to ultimately make reliable predictions of earthquakes.  In this transformative study, we will make use of state-of-the-art materials science testing methods, namely atomic force microscopy and Nanoindentation, to provide a physical basis for friction observations at a coarser scale and thereby gain a much improved understanding of the earthquake process.  This work may allow us to learn whether we are likely to be able to detect accelerating creep on faults just prior to an earthquake and thereby predict earthquakes days to hours before an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to the built environment.  From the perspective of the scientific fields of mechanics and materials science, these new insights, gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales, have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. Technical description. The overarching goals of the proposed studies are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at asperity contacts at frictional interfaces.  A more specific major goal of our study is to understand the origin of the friction state ?evolution? effect in rate and state friction, the simplest manifestation of which is an increase in ?static? friction with the time of quasi-stationary contact.  To that end, we will conduct a coordinated, interdisciplinary collaboration that will employ laboratory experiments that investigate frictional phenomena over a wide range of length scales. One outcome will be to develop constitutive equations that will allow extrapolation of these mechanisms to the elevated temperatures and longer times relevant for earthquakes. We will perform macro-scale friction experiments on rocks at Brown University, micro-scale to nano-scale indentation creep, adhesion, and friction experiments in the Nanoindenters at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and nano-scale adhesion and friction experiments in atomic force microscopes at the University of Pennsylvania. To make connections between the different types of experiments and to isolate different origins of the state evolution effect, we will vary the same environmental conditions in all three sets of experiments. These include tests as a function of humidity, pH (in liquid), and temperature. All three environmental factors have been demonstrated to influence the evolution effect in macroscopic rock friction experiments. Nanoindentation and AFM measurements should allow us to determine the processes on an asperity scale responsible for the macroscopic behavior',\n",
       " \"This proposal is focused on problems in applied mathematics which may be attacked using algebraic methods. There are three themes:  (1) Information transmission and coding theory, (2) Rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) Approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  The main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  For example, in past work, the PI has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the PI has used toric geometry and Cayley-Bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. The coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the PI will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the Groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. Finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? Here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.One of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from CD systems to space communication. In a perfect world, the signal sent from point A and the signal which arrives at point B are identical. In the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. In signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. So the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? The solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point B can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. It turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). One aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. A second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. Given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). This is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. The goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. The final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like Boeing to model surfaces.  The PI will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. Accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines\",\n",
       " 'In this project the PI will study how the primate retina processes and encodes visual images. The retina is an extraordinarily sophisticated optical image detector, converting a light image into a set of electrical signals, filtering these signals both spatially and temporally, and sending the output up the optic nerve to the brain. The output signals consist of multiple trains of electrical spikes organized in an exquisite and complex way, with more than 20 separate parallel pathways carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. In pilot experiments, a number of previously unknown, or poorly known, functional types of retinal neurons have been uncovered and in this research project the PI will answer the following questions: What roles do these cell types play in retinal processing? How do these neurons respond to different kinds of visual images? What information about the outside visual world do these cells communicate to the brain, and how is this information encoded? To answer these questions, a movie will be focused on the retinal input neurons (the rod and cone photoreceptors) and the electrical spikes generated by the retinal output neurons (including the new and poorly-known cell types) will be imaged and recorded by a dense two-dimensional array of over 500 microscopic electrodes. The output signals will then be correlated in space and time among themselves and with the input visual images to probe the neural code at the retina/brain interface. This research project will aid the development of future retinal prosthetic devices that are intended to restore some visual function in blind human patients with retinas damaged by photoreceptor disease. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students in both physics and biology',\n",

Students will have access to real-world data for projects without the hassle of having to gather data from a number of disparate sources.  Most importantly, an enhanced LEPR and the LEPR-EarthChem connection will create a data-mining environment that promotes synthesis and model development from diverse data sources',\n",

       " 'Status and stigma are fundamental factors that influence the ways that individuals organize themselves in social groups. Status is a social process whereby persons in groups locate themselves and others in hierarchies of influence and prestige. Stigma is a process whereby members of social groups identify certain attributes as discrediting, subjecting those who possess them to social rejection and exclusion. Research on status processes in groups has identified a number of attributes that act as status markers, including gender, race, age, and education. Research on stigma processes has also identified a number of attributes that are stigmatizing, including mental illness and physical disability. The research literatures on stigma and status have both proliferated in recent decades, but they have operated more or less independently. Mental illness and physical disability, for example, are absent from research on status processes in groups. Research on stigma, in turn, does not typically attend to status-related outcomes such as influence and performance evaluations. The investigators will carry out three studies that address areas of convergence and departure between status and stigma processes in groups.The first study is an experiment to be completed at the University of Maryland to investigate responses to an attribute identified in prior research as a status marker (educational attainment), attributes identified as stigmatizing (various categories of mental illness), and an attribute identified in research as both a marker of status and stigma (race) in order to determine ways in which reactions to the attributes overlap and diverge. The second project, to be completed at Columbia University, is a study of implicit attitudes toward persons with mental illness. Unlike self-report measures of attitudes that require the attention and control of individuals, the expression of implicit attitudes is spontaneous and unintentional. The major advantage of implicit measures is that they have the capacity to overcome social desirability biases that are common in other types of attitude measures. The third project is an audit study to test for status- and stigma-related outcomes of mental illness in employment decisions. The study involves sending job applications to employment listings, varying whether the applications specify a history of mental illness.By employing multiple methodological approaches as well as variables and measures that represent both traditions, the three studies have the potential to significantly push forward the independent research literatures on both status and stigma processes in groups. The studies also have the capacity to inform intervention programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness. Although there have been several recent calls for interventions to reduce the stigma of mental illness, most of these interventions have not included a research component. Because the interventions with the highest likelihood of success will be grounded in basic research, and because poorly grounded interventions may result in wasted resources and pessimism about our ability to reduce stigma, the proposed studies represent an important complement to more applied approaches to eradicate the stigma of mental illness',\n",
       " \"The Democratic Party's contest for the 2008 presidential nominee went on longer and divided the party more deeply than any other such contest in recent history. By contrast, the Republican Party's nomination race was relatively quick and did not generate deep fissures within the party. This research will shed light on the nature of modern political parties. The party is not the formal hierarchy it may have been a century ago, in which bosses could dictate the choice of nominee to the rank and file with little expectation of resistance. Today's parties are better thought of as networks of formal party groups, interest groups, and donors. It is these networks that allow parties to manage a crisis, such as an intraparty rift during a competitive election.The researchers will investigate these intraparty rifts and the role of social networks as part of the effort to heal them by conducting interviews of delegates to both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in August and September of 2008. Respondents will asked their opinions about the major candidates for the presidential nominations, their previous involvement in party activities, their membership in various interest groups, and their cultural beliefs about the importance of intraparty democracy. Respondents will be contacted for follow-up interviews in the late fall to determine the effect of fall campaigns on intraparty factionalism. The researchers will test the hypotheses that involvement in expanded party networks (including interest groups and party posts) mitigates this factionalism and that participation in such networks promotes loyalty to party rather than to a specific candidate.This research will have broader impacts on the way this presidential election season is understood by political observers. Rather than making assumptions about the fractious nature of the primary season and its effect on the general election, journalists and other observers will be able to draw upon our this research for concrete measurements and qualitative assessments of these rifts. Additionally, this research will also involve the use of graduate and undergraduate students at multiple institutions as survey administrators. These students will receive specialized training that will enrich their academic experiences\",\n",
       " \"The PI of this project will study questions related to the moduli spaces of sheaves and morphisms. Regarding the moduli spaces of sheaves, the main themes to be covered are: the 'strange duality' isomorphism for the moduli space of bundles on a curve as the curve varies in moduli - in particular, extensions of 'strange duality' to nodal curves and to general structure groups; the Theta bundles, their sections, and 'rank-level' dualities on the moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces (the latter in collaboration with Alina Marian); computation of intersection theoretic invariants on the moduli space of higher-rank framed/unframed sheaves on threefolds. Regarding stable morphisms, and building on previous work, the author will pursue a further study of the topology of the moduli space of stable maps and of the associated tautological systems. The projects above are aimed to the understanding of the topology, geometry and intersection theory of various moduli spaces of sheaves and morphisms. One of the goals is to exploit the inter-connections these moduli spaces enjoy.Moduli spaces arise as answers to classification and parametrization problems, putting together objects with similar structure. Questions about these objects (e.g. counting problems, questions about families) often involve a detailed study of the relevant moduli spaces. The moduli spaces of stable sheaves and stable morphisms are two of the primary examples occurring in algebraic geometry. In addition to their importance within the field, they bear multiple connections with other branches of classical and modern mathematics such as complex analysis, representation theory, theoretical physics, symplectic geometry, gauge theory, differential geometry, combinatorics and topology\",\n",
       " \"The National Science Foundation (NSF) is proud to announce that 32-year-old Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles, will receive its 2008 Alan T. Waterman Award. Called a  supreme problem-solver,  and named one of  the Brilliant 10  scientists by Popular Science (October 2006), Tao's extraordinary work, much of which has been funded by NSF through the years, has had a tremendous impact across several mathematical areas. He will receive the award at a black tie dinner program at the U.S. Department of State on May 6.The annual Waterman award recognizes an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by NSF. Candidates may not be more than 35 years old, or seven years beyond receiving a doctorate, and must stand out for their individual achievements. In addition to a medal, the awardee receives a grant of $500,000 over a 3-year period for scientific research or advanced study in their field.Terence Tao was born in Adelaide, Australia, in 1975. His genius at mathematics began early in life. He started to learn calculus when he was 7 years old, at which age he began high school; by the age of 9 he was already very good at university-level calculus. By the age of 11, he was thriving in international mathematics competitions. Tao was 20 when he earned his doctorate from Princeton University, and he joined UCLA's faculty that year. UCLA promoted him to full professor at age 24. Tao now holds UCLA's James and Carol Collins Chair in the College of Letters and Science. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society and the Australian Academy of Sciences (corresponding member).Nicknamed  the Mozart of Math,  Tao's areas of research include partial differential equations (PDE), combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Harmonic analysis is an advanced form of calculus that uses equations from physics. Some of this work involves, in a colleague's words,  geometrical constructions that almost no one understands.  Tao also works in a related field, nonlinear partial differential equations, and in the entirely distinct fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and combinatorics, which involves counting.In addition to the prestigious Waterman award, Tao has received a number of other awards, including the Salem Prize in 2000; the Bochner Prize in 2002; the Fields Medal, often touted as the  Nobel Prize for Mathematics  and SASTRA Ramanujan Prize in 2006; and the MacArthur Fellowship and Ostrowski Prize in 2007.Through the years, Tao's research has often been funded by other NSF grants. His current research is funded by NSF Award #0649473,  Global Behaviour of Critical Nonlinear PDE\",\n",
       " \"There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons.  However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live.  In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training\",\n",
       " \"The Holocaust was a profoundly geographical event that caused mass displacement and migration, destroyed or fundamentally changed thousands of communities, and created hundreds of new places for the concentration of population, the exploitation of labor, and the mass murder of millions of people. Yet its spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics have scarcely been studied as explicitly geographical phenomena. Nor have scholars critically considered the complex and varied range of spatial scales at which the events constituting the Holocaust took place, from the individual body to the continental expanse of Europe. Through a partnership with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) and access to its exceptionally detailed datasets, the research team will build a set of GIS applications and geovisualizations to carry out four overlapping and interlinked case studies on (1) the evolution of the spatial system of concentration camps; (2) a comparative study of victim transports from France and Italy; (3) a localized study of forced evacuations or death marches from concentration camps at the end of WWII; and (4) a detailed study of the Budapest ghetto. These cases have been chosen for their suitability for GIScience modeling and analysis at a variety of scales and because they represent the range of spatial experiences of Holocaust victims (ghettoization, transportation, incarceration in the concentration camp system).This project will be the first systematic examination of the geographies of the Holocaust. Previous historical scholarship on the Holocaust has focused on Nazi policy, individual camps, particular atrocities, or the history of certain communities, groups, or nations. This project will take a synoptic view of the Holocaust as a multi-layered, multi-scaled event and analyze it by employing geographic information science (GIScience methodologies. For GIScience, the challenges posed by historical source data make this project a significant opportunity to advance new approaches to metadata and source interpretation. Our research methods will provide models for other scholars working in historical GIS as well. Few studies have moved historical GIS (HGIS) beyond the important but conceptually limited stage of infrastructure development to grapple with substantive research questions. Even fewer HGIS projects have examined historical events or conditions of major social significance. This project does both.The results of this project will be disseminated through professional conference presentations, a final workshop at the USHMM open to the general public, peer-reviewed journal articles, a book co-edited by the two PIs with contributions from all the project's participants, and an interactive website on the Geographies of the Holocaust to be built and hosted at the USHMM. Finally, data and GIS applications will be deposited at the USHMM Archives and the Registry of Survivors for long-term preservation and dissemination\",\n",
       " 'This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization. Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services',\n",

Congress may pass legislation that taxes one group of citizens to finance spending on another group.   Bureaucrats may impose regulations at a cost to some people to benefit others.  While economists, political scientists, psychologists, and decision scientists have studied group decision making, we do not know much about how individuals make decisions in these situations.

       " \"Examples of plant secondary metabolites acting in a synergistic fashion as insect deterrents are not common, and many studies focus on the pharmaceutical applications of natural products where activity is serendipitous and not an evolved response. This project will test for synergy between plant products in the deterrence of insects, the activity for which they have ostensibly evolved. Synergy between compounds in a mixture produced by a single plant species (intraclass synergy) will be tested in three systems: the imides of Piper species (Piperaceae, Piperales), the iridoid glycosides of Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae, Lamiales), and the furanocoumarins of Pastinaca sativa (Apiaceae, Apiales). The imides of P. imperiale and P. melanocladum are structurally very similar to imides and amides from Piper cenocladum and P. tuberculatum which have recently been shown to act synergistically against a broad array of insects. This proposed work tests the generality of intraclass synergy for imides and amides of the genus Piper. To test if intraclass synergy is general to other classes of natural products, the iridoid glycosides (monoterpene glycosides) and furanocoumarins will be examined, since they are structurally unrelated to the Piper amides/imides and to each other, and both classes of compounds have a well documented central role in plant insect interactions.With the support of this linked collaborative award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the collaborative work of two chemists and an ecologist, Professors Craig D. Dodson and Joseph L. Richards, of the Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences at Mesa State College, and Professor Lee A. Dyer, of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University. The approach outlined in this proposal will provide novel methods for chemical ecology, bioassays, and statistical analyses. It will provide rigorous tests of important hypotheses on how intraclass compounds act synergistically to deter insects. The work will contribute to a long term goal to determine if antiherbivore synergy is widespread among plant secondary metabolites. If synergy is found to be general and widespread when testing for activity against ecologically relevant insect herbivores, then it is consistent with a general hypothesis that plants evolved multiple compounds as synergists for defense against herbivores and pathogens. These results are also directly relevant to the way insects are controlled on crops. The proposed work will continue a decade-long, successful collaboration between two chemists and an ecologist. The collaboration involves an undergraduate institution and a research university and has successfully trained a large number of graduate and undergraduate students. The current proposal includes funding for one graduate student and 12 undergraduates. Students will be broadly trained in both biology and chemistry, and the collaborators will continue to be involved with important training programs for these students at Tulane, such as Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the Ecological Society of America's SEEDS program for minorities, the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation, and Fulbright's LASPAU program for training faculty from other countries\",\n",

Tools to assist the synthesis of particular frameworks, such as template identification, will be developed. A searchable interactive database of hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be openly available online. Users will be able to explore the physical properties of zeolites and to upload molecular shapes to find the best- matched pores. In addition, users who have synthesized a new material will be able to upload a powder diffraction pattern to find the best match, thereby accelerating the structure-solution of unknown materials. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (and filtered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization. This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures.Layperson's abstractZeolites are arguably one of the most useful classes of materials.  Their structures contain crystalline arrays of pores and open channels that are wide enough to allow small molecules such as water and light oil molecules to enter and leave. In addition, their chemical composition allows them to behave as solid acids. Because of these useful properties, zeolites are used extensively in the petrochemical industry, and there is significant effort to synthesize new zeolites with different absorption properties. Currently, the rate of discovery of new zeolites is slow, being done, essentially, through trial and error.This project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Hypothetical useful zeolites will be predicted by mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, and their physical properties will be computed in order to identify the potentially useful ones.

       " \"This project will investigate the genetic underpinnings of language development by studying language-related abilities in families of children with autism. Autism is a severe developmental disorder defined by profound impairments in language, as well as social-emotional functioning and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviors. Although evidence supports a role of genetic factors in autism, the identification of susceptibility genes remains an elusive goal. This project will characterize developmental language profiles present among unaffected family members (parents and siblings), which may be linked to the genes involved in autism. To do so, this study capitalizes on an unprecedented opportunity -- the availability of archival childhood language testing records from a large cohort of families with a child with autism. Using these valuable data, the study will characterize language development of parents and siblings longitudinally over the early school-age years, documenting these relatives' developmental pathways of early language functioning that may be related to the genes involved in autism. The study will also collect DNA from individuals with autism and their family members so that their profiles may be applied to genetic studies examining links to specific genetic variants. Finally, this research will examine relatives' current language profiles and address environmental factors that may protect or augment baseline genetic liability. This could reflect gene-environment interactions, which are critical in understanding factors that influence language development. Autism is a major public health concern. Though once considered to be relatively rare, striking new prevalence estimates of 1 in 150 recently prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to declare autism a national public health crisis. Such reports underscore the pressing urgency for determining the cause of this serious disorder. Information obtained from this study will help target genetic research in autism via the study of genes differentially associated with language functioning in families with a child with autism. That is, by examining developmental pathways of early language functioning among relatives, the study aims to identify developmental profiles that may reflect genetic liability to autism and will be used in current and future molecular genetic studies.  In addition, results provide insight into the underpinnings of language development more generally. The study of developmental growth in genetically-based disorders such as autism can provide crucial insights into genetic and environmental processes of healthy development. Findings from this research may therefore provide a foundation for future work on the genetics of language\",\n",

Further, participants will examine the practicality of establishing a National Center for Neutrino Study (NCNS) similar in nature to the Space Telescope Science Institute or the Advanced Photon Source. User community members will be invited to participate in the workshop and will be asked to describe their vision of utilizing neutrino detection devices nationally with the intent to integrate their use globally. These visions will be informed by a clear understanding of the prospects and limitations intrinsic in antineutrino physics provided by the US neutrino science community attendees.

       " \"This project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach that integrates new geometrical techniques, modeling, and experiments to address fundamental, open questions concerning the physical properties of granular media and other jammed materials such as glasses, foams, and colloids.  The hallmark of jammed materials is that they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids.  In addition, many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force chain networks when external forces are applied.   Although the existence of force chains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in physical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been unable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them.  Precise identification and characterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces will likely have a transformative impact in many arenas.  For example, financial and energy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high inefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone.  Also, avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of granular media detrimentally impacts mankind.  In this work, we will apply novel mathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain a quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials. The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to students from underrepresented groups.  We will organize education and recruiting trips to predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black schools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the Southeast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including demonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.  During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and technology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups.  To stimulate further student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so that promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical aspects of our research.

The hallmark of jammed materials isthat they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids. In addition,many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as forcechain networks when external forces are applied. Although the existence of forcechains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role inphysical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have beenunable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them. Precise identification andcharacterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forceswill likely have a transformative impact in many arenas. For example, financial andenergy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with highinefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone. Also,avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior ofgranular media detrimentally impacts mankind. In this work, we will apply novelmathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtaina quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials.The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities tostudents from underrepresented groups. We will organize education and recruiting tripsto predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically blackschools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in theSoutheast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, includingdemonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science andtechnology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups. To stimulatefurther student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses sothat promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoreticalaspects of our research. To encourage close collaboration among researchers in thefield of jammed materials, we will organize biannual interdisciplinary workshops.

       " \"This award supports research and education in theoretical polymer physics. The research focus addresses the problem of explicit solvent effects on polymer chain conformation. Because the complex structure of a polymer, whether synthetic or biological, depends on the fluid in which it exists, it is necessary to either include the details (e.g atoms in a host liquid) or employ an effective medium approximation adequate to predict polymer chain conformation. The research carried out in this effort   replaces the complex environment by suitably accurate (and more complicated) effective interaction.  The approach feeds into the general field of multiscale modeling, especially in polymeric systems. The domain of validity of the approach and the accuracy of its extensions are primary interests of the research.The center piece research effort develops a detailed theoretical understanding of the coupling between polymer conformation and solvent properties. A simple, yet realistic continuum based interaction-site model is used in which both polymer and solvent are built from  simple-liquid  monomers. The approach  maps the many-body chain-in-solvent problem onto a few-body single-chain problem via the introduction of a set of site-site solvation potentials. This approach fully incorporates the local solvent structure into the solvation potentials.The research evolves from recent work by the PI that (i) establishes the validity of a pair-wise decomposition of the exact many-body solvation potential for a short chain in a simple-liquid solvent and (ii) successfully applies short chain solvation potential results to long-chain systems. These initial results indicated the potential  application to a broad range of systems. The research of this award focuses on the extends the approach to a larger class of interaction potentials and thus more realistic systems, including asymmetric systems in which the polymer and solvent are built from different interaction sites and to systems with molecular (and polymeric) solvents. The effects of solvent on chain conformation and collapse, as well as multi-body correlations, are studied in each of these systems.The activities undertaken have broad impact beyond the specific research problems. This research represents an important step towards the goal of developing a complete theory of polymeric liquids based on the rigorous techniques of liquid state physics. The approach provides a straightforward way to account for solvent effects in polymer systems without having to perform computationally expensive full-solvent simulations. The results of this research are disseminated both through publication in scientific journals and through presentation at local, regional, and national meetings. The research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at the PI's college. Computation and simulation methods taught in the core physics courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work.

NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education in theoretical polymer physics. The research focus addresses the problem of predicting the shape of long polymers when dissolved in different solvents. Because the complex structure of a polymer, whether synthetic or biological, depends on the fluid in which it exists, it is necessary to either include the details (e.g thousands of atoms in a host liquid) or employ an approximation  to accurately predict polymer chain conformation. The research carried out in this effort  replaces the complex environment of the host liquid by suitably accurate (and more complicated) set of rules for how the atoms of polymer interact with each other.   The domain of validity of the approach and the accuracy of its extensions are primary interests of the research.The center piece research effort develops a detailed theoretical understanding of the coupling between polymer shape and solvent properties. A simple, yet realistic  model is used in which both polymer and solvent are built from  simple-liquid  pseudo-atoms. The approach  maps the complex polymer-in-solvent problem onto a simpler polymer-only problem.The activities undertaken have broad impact beyond the specific research problems. This topic is of broad importance since the overall properties of dissolved polymers, including polymer solubility, solution viscosity, and  functionality, are intimately linked to the underlying microscopic configuration  of the individual polymer molecules. The results of this research are disseminated both through publication in scientific journals and through presentation at local, regional, and national meetings. The research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at the PI's college. Computation and simulation methods taught in the core physics courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work. The undergraduate students who participate in this research benefit by learning state-of-the-art computer simulation techniques and have opportunities to present papers at scientific meetings.

       " 'A computational database will be investigated for cyber-enabled discovery of spatio-temporal transport and mixing dynamics in geophysical turbulent flows modeled through simulation. It will be possible to identify vortical flow structures and follow them in time to compute conditional flow quantities, thereby, quantifying the dynamical role of these structures. The database provides an efficient extensible framework for formulating and validating hypotheses. It combines the machinery of an imperative model of spatial data retrieval with powerful computational facilities tailored to dynamic representations of irregular time-dependent structures, overcoming limitations of relational databases in handling such data. Broader impacts of this research are in its contributions to the national infrastructure for research and education in Computer Science, Geosciences and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering; it will lead to a computational methodology applicable to any field that involves time-dependent, multi-scale physical phenomena and admits mathematical rules to characterize features that are posited to be dynamically important.Two Ph.D. students will be trained and will work together with collaborators outside their own fields, enabling cross-disciplinary teaching and training. Research results will be integrated into high-performance computing courses and the database will be used as a tool in graduate courses in turbulence and computational fluid dynamics. The software produced by the investigation will be disseminated publicly. The investigators will actively recruit from under-represented groups',\n",
       " 'Error-correcting codes, studied in a branch of science and engineering known as coding theory, safeguard data against the adverse effects of noise and enable reliable storage and communication of information.  Such codes pervade our daily lives, with applications ranging from computer hard-disks and UPS bar-codes to cell phones and the Internet to deep space communication. One of the most fundamental questions in coding theory is the following: What is the largest possible fraction of errors that a code of information rate R can correct? Recent theoretical breakthroughs provide a complete answer to this question, namely that the ultimate error-correction radius of 1-R can be reached (by codes over sufficiently large alphabets). Moreover, it can be reached constructively with polynomial-time list decoding, via codes closely related to Reed-Solomon codes, which are ubiquitous in practice.From a practical standpoint, this promises a factor of two improvement over classical error-correction algorithms that are in widespread use today. While this is extremely encouraging, numerous challenges must be overcome in order to bring the theoretical promise of the recent results to practice. This project, led by a multi-disciplinary team, involves an integrated collection of research activities targeted at progress towards the long term goal of attaining the fundamental limit of error-correction. At the theoretical end, the goals include improving the complexity of the decoding algorithms as one approaches the optimal error-correction radius of 1-R, and devising faster algorithms and heuristics for the key steps involved in algebraic list decoding. The project also studies methods to reap the practical benefits of combining the new codes with soft-decision decoding, putting to use the ample amount of probabilistic symbol reliability estimates often available to decoders. Furthermore, the research lays the groundwork for eventual implementation of such algorithms in high-speed/low-power VLSI, thereby enabling the potential deployment of the new codes in a broad range of communication and storage systems. On the education front, the project provides a stimulating research environment for graduate students, encouraging team-work across university boundaries and collaboration across disciplines (computer science, communication theory, and VLSI design',\n",
       " 'CBET-0755632  MillerThe goal of this research is to identify the fundamental mechanisms by which non-equilibrium plasmas promote combustion.  The specific focus is on examining excited species from a non-equilibrium plasma and their roles and energy efficiency in autoignition and flame stabilization.  Effects of various species (atoms, radicals, excited molecules) will be studied separately in a carefully controlled environment by generating the active species in a corona discharge and then injecting them into a fuel-air mixture. Reaction progress will be determined using in-situ gas sampling and laser diagnostics. Recent publications have demonstrated the value of these low-temperature plasmas in promoting ignition and flame propagation of hydrocarbons.  One intriguing observation is that autoignition and flames have occurred for temperatures and stoichiometries that are outside the normal flammability limits for the fuels tested.  However, recent modeling work suggests that the increased radical concentration produced by plasmas is insufficient to produce this effect.   Furthermore, existing studies have not been able to discriminate between the effect of ionic species or excited species in promoting combustion, and excited species have essentially been ignored in traditional hydrocarbon combustion studies.  Finding the true mechanism is the key to effective flame ignition and stabilization not only above but also below the autoignition threshold.  This research combines the low-temperature, pre-ignition expertise of the Combustion and Fuels Research Group at Drexel University and the plasma expertise of the A. J. Drexel Plasma Institute at Drexel University, strengthening the work scientifically and engaging students in the resulting multidisciplinary research activity.  The project will also leverage and take advantage of existing programs at Drexel University for enhancing minority participation at the graduate and undergraduate level, such as IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship), Bridges to the Doctorate, GAANN (Graduate Assistantships in the Areas of National Need), GEM (Graduate Education for Minorities), AMP (Alliance for Minority Participation), and three REU site programs. Introducing combustion, plasma, energy efficiency, and emissions reduction to under-represented minority students will help them to explore and develop their career interest in these fields',\n",
       " 'The understanding of cooperative processes in biomolecular systems (such as protein dynamics, folding, and self-assembly) poses outstanding challenges both for theory and experiment. The large number of degrees of freedom involved, and the degree of heterogeneity present, may at a first glance suggest the lack of general principles. As Francis Crick wrote twenty years ago, commenting on macromolecular dynamics,  what seems to physicists a hopelessly complicated process may have been what Nature found simplest . The behavior of a macro-molecular system appears overwhelmingly complicated. Biologically relevant macro-molecular systems are the result of billions of years of evolution, during which details and exceptions have been selected for functional reasons. In spite of the complexity, collective phenomena emerge in macromolecular systems, as for instance in protein folding and self-assembly processes, suggesting the existence of organizing principles that may actually exploit the complexity to obtain simplicity.Is it possible to understand (that is, reproduce, quantify, and predict) how organization emerges from the interactions of the single degrees of freedom in a biomolecular system, over a broad spectrum of length and timescales? Empirical and theoretical evidence supports the idea that for most macromolecular processes only a small portion of the conformational space is visited, and that for medium/long time scales a very small number of parameters are enough to describe the coarse dynamics of a large macromolecular system. Previous work in this direction has not been automatic or systematic, and has been driven mostly by physical intuition, with little or no guarantee of success.It is the goal of this work to develop and apply a radically different approach, that reconciles biological and biochemical approaches with a physical and mathematical perspective. A key step towards the formulation of the general  rules  that evolution has employed for regulating the behavior of biomolecular processes resides in the mathematically rigorous identification and the physically sound interpretation of the minimal set of effective parameters needed to faithful reproduce the macromolecular process of interest. The methods that will be developed to this end are based on multiscale geometric measure theory, harmonic analysis, and dimensionality reduction. The core of these ideas will be widely applicable to the analysis of the geometry of large high dimensional data sets, across and beyond biophysics, leading to novel general paradigms for dimensionality reduction and regression on such data sets',\n",
       " 'Intellectual Merit. This research addresses challenging issues of organic matter (OM) preservation in marine clay-rich sediment and soils using novel techniques for visualizing three dimensionally OM in nano- and microfabric signatures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This effort will advance the understanding of processes and mechanisms and nano- and microfabric signatures that drive OM preservation at these scales during the very early development of marine sediment. It will provide direct  cutting edge  evidence confirming or refuting concepts and ideas advanced without direct observational evidence by the scientific community concerning OM preservation in marine sediment. It will provide direct visual evidence of protection against enzymatic digestion of OM by clay fabric. Hypotheses to be tested include, (1) pore throats and tortuosity of pores impedes the movement of enzymes through clay fabric and (2) OM is preferentially sorbed onto edges of clay platelets and interstices at the junctures of clay domains. Hypothesis testing entails developing a realistic quantitative three-dimensional visual model of OM protection based on potential enzymatic digestion of specific substrates and direct TEM observations of OM distribution with respect to pores reconstructed from serial sections of sediments representing the globally most important OM depocenter. Clay is inherently electron dense and easily visualized by TEM; visualization of OM will be accomplished with electron dense stains. Smectite and illite clay samples will be studied including field collected fecal pellets from marine polychaetes. This research will advance the development of realistic conceptual models of OM preservation and ultimately organic carbon cycling based on direct visualization of organo-clay relationships and quantitative analysis. The research will also provide quantitative data for advancing (1) understanding of biogeochemical fluxes of organic carbon in marine sediments and (2) the development of emerging models addressing organo-clay preservation dynamics.Broader Impacts. A graduate student from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) will be trained in TEM techniques and image analysis, will participate in writing manuscripts, and in presenting data at regional and national scientific meetings. Training will be offered to science education graduate students in TEM techniques and image analysis during our regular summer teaching program. Undergraduates through the local NSF REU program will assist in TEM work and image analysis and present research at local and regional meetings. The project supports three investigators at two institutions in an EPSCoR state and establishes collaboration among disciplines and institutions with CoPIs from academia and the private sector. Research results will be published in leading international journals as well as local and national professional meetings. A website will be established to make our data and interpretations widely available. This project has broader societal and economic implications by increasing knowledge of OM sequestration during early sediment diagenesis and understanding the development of protokerogen and ultimately kerogen in petroleum source rocks',\n",

       " 'A theoretical research and training program is proposed in the fundamental area of growth of unstable interfaces and related problems, a fast developing area in contemporary research. The growth of an interface is said to be unstable if a smooth initial interface eventually develops a fractal structure.  Under this umbrella one studies important and distinct phenomena such as growth of bacterial colonies and cancer cells, dynamics of chemical reaction, propagation of crystallization fronts, dynamics of the Quantum Hall droplets, transport of 1D fermions, Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), surface instabilities in hydrodynamical flows, Integrable Models, and 2D Quantum Gravity and Matrix Models.  Laplacian Growth (LG) is the simplest nontrivial model of such unstable growth. In LG the velocity of the interface is proportional to the gradient of some scalar field with an additional condition of incompressibility. This scalar field can represent very different physical quantities such as electrostatic field, food concentration, or a pressure field. It is an excellent context in which to study the general phenomena of unstable growth. The proposed project looks beyond current LG formalism to the possibility of using symmetries and the introduction of stochastic noise to the problem, making it more realistic and relevant. It will allow one to: i) consider the selection problem in any geometry of Laplacian Growth as a problem of stability against stochastic noise; ii) introduce new formalisms for the growth more closely connected to experiment; iii) approach the problem of finding the (multi)fractal properties of the interface; iv) formulate the Laplacian Growth as a Hamiltonian problem.Broader impact: 1. LG and DLA are good research area for graduate and undergraduate students to be introduced into nonlinear dynamics, Integrable Models, and other contemporary areas of mathematics and physics.  It will allow a student to see the effects of nonlinear couplings, see the emergence of new fundamental dynamical properties which arise due to stochasticity. The student will gain an experience in interdisciplinary research.  2. The PI and the students will publish in peer reviewed journals and give presentations at conferences. In addition the PI will use every opportunity for media appearances and public lectures to communicate the results to a broader public.  3. The proposed research will contribute to the development of a better understanding of the dynamics of growth of unstable interfaces in all the applications mentioned above.  These areas are of the great importance for the technology, medicine, and environmental studies',\n",
       " 'This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization.  Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field.This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists.  In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics.  Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and  or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields.In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science,  we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines.With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge).It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge.  Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field.The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both  collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents.The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services',\n",
       " 'One of the most exciting challenges in contemporary science is uncovering the genetic basis for the origin of uniquely human traits. Humans and other great apes are genetically very similar, yet diverse aspects of human anatomy, physiology, and behavior are markedly distinct. Recent technological developments provide the ability to begin identifying the specific genes that underlie these important trait differences. This project will focus on the evolution of human diet. Dietary traits are particularly interesting because the diet of early human ancestors and modern humans differ so markedly from those of the other great apes and because diet affects so many aspects of human health and disease. An interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and human geneticists will integrate genetic, organismal, and ecological information to better understand the genetic basis for the evolution of dietary traits in humans. The primary intellectual goals of this project are to: (1) screen the human genome for relevant genes using two approaches, measuring gene expression across the entire genome from humans and chimpanzees in several tissues of dietary significance using ultra high-throughput sequencing and testing for adaptation in DNA sequences across the entire genome based on patterns of mutation; (2) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes implicated in trait changes during human origins through extensive DNA sequence comparisons among great ape species, detailed characterization of gene expression, experimental tests of functional differences, and associations between gene expression and specific dietary traits; and (3) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes among modern African human populations that are diverse with respect to diet and local climate, through detailed analyses of genetic variation, tests for natural selection, and genetic associations with specific dietary traits. The broader impacts of this research include: collaborations and resource building with African scientists, recruitment and training of women and minority trainees, education outreach to grade school students, building two novel and informative databases that will be easily accessible through the web, and developing software for comparative analysis of primate genome sequences and gene expression',\n",
       " \"People may be unaware of their own important underlying attitudes and beliefs, particularly in the domains of stereotyping and prejudice. Nevertheless, these  implicit biases  significantly influence inter-group behavior in everyday social interactions. Indeed, the influence of these biases often is greater than that of explicitly stated inter-group attitudes and beliefs, affecting important outcomes for members of minority groups. As such, it is critical to understand the nature and operation of implicit bias, as well as the factors that may change them or reduce their influence. To achieve these goals, Dr. Jeffrey Sherman of the University of California - Davis uses mathematical modeling with a tool called the Quad model that he developed in his past research. Application of this tool has shown that implicit attitudes and beliefs sometimes may reflect the automatic activation of biased associations in memory or may reflect failures to regulate the influences of such associations on behavior. The Quad model can be used to estimate the independent roles of each of these factors in producing biased and unbiased behavior. There are four specific goals in this research. First, the Quad model will be applied to shed light on the contextual and individual factors that influence the extent of implicit bias. Implicit bias has been shown to vary significantly across social contexts and across individuals, often reflecting personal goals and motives. This research will model contextual and individual differences in implicit bias in order to better understand the factors that increase or decrease the automatic activation of biased associations and the ability to regulate the expression of those associations. The second goal is to apply a  treatment  approach to reducing implicit bias. In these studies, interventions that are designed specifically to influence either underlying associations or the ability to regulate those associations will be applied to individuals and contexts associated with enhanced activation of associations or diminished ability to self-regulate. The goal is to show how interventions can be tailored to address specific deficits in processing (over-activation of associations vs. failure of regulation) associated with increases in implicit bias. The third goal is to use the Quad model to better understand the relationships among different measures of stereotyping and prejudice, which frequently fail to correspond to one another. The present research proposes that dissociations among these different measures may reflect differences in the extents to which the measures reflect the automatic activation of associations versus the failure to regulate the associations. Application of the model will help to specify when and why different measures will and will not produce corresponding results. Finally, the fourth goal is to use the Quad model to better predict behavior in inter-group settings. Measures of stereotyping and prejudice are sometimes poor predictors of people's actual behavior towards members of minority groups. The Quad model can improve the ability of these measures to predict behavior by independently assessing the roles of automatic associations, the ability to regulate those associations, and interactions between these components. In sum, the purpose of this research is to improve the measurement of stereotyping and prejudice, increase understanding of the factors that increase or decrease such biases, and improve the ability of measures of bias to predict people's behavior.  Implicit attitudes influence behavior in important domains of life including law enforcement, health, and employment.  It is therefore critical to gain a better understanding of their nature and operation\",\n",

       " 'In 2001, Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was established with the support of the National Science Foundation.  TESS is an infrastructure project that capitalizes on economies of scale to enable scholars from across the social sciences, on a competitive basis, to conduct ground-breaking research on issues of broad theoretical and practical importance.  Since its inception, TESS has enabled an unprecedented number of researchers to collect original, high quality nationally-representative experimental data. On a continuous basis, TESS solicits proposals to test methodological and substantive hypotheses from across the social sciences, submits them to a rigorous peer review process, and then implements the most innovative and promising experiments on its Internet-based data collection platform. This platform draws on national probability samples of respondents and offers the capability for implementing complex experimental designs. The key to TESS is multiple studies, from different disciplines, sharing a common observational platform, all exploiting the inferential power of experimental designs and nationally representative samples. By distributing the costs of sampling, data collection, and data management over a large number of studies, TESS dramatically reduces the average cost of each study and makes experimentation on general-population samples available to researchers for whom the obstacles to such work would be otherwise prohibitive. As a scientific investment, therefore, TESS offers broad, immediate, and long-lasting benefits. At the same time, many of its costs are remarkably low. Viewed as a whole, TESS breaks new ground by following the best scientific practice of the past ? it harnesses cutting edge technology and uses it to create and disseminate new discoveries about critical social and behavioral phenomena. Indeed, while TESS has innovated in many ways, its basic strategy is to follow a path that has served science well in the past ? make the best technology available to our best scientific minds.The broader impacts of TESS are substantial.  Most obviously, TESS enhances the infrastructure for research and education, providing a common platform for the conduct and analysis of general population experiments.  In so doing, TESS advances discovery and understanding by capitalizing on economies of scale to make general population experiments feasible to a diverse array of talented, innovative social scientists, most of whom would otherwise be unable to conduct such research.  TESS also promotes teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels in a number of ways.  For example, graduate students from across the social sciences are encouraged to submit TESS proposals, and expert reviewers provide detailed feedback.  Graduate students (and even a handful of undergraduates) have been PIs or co-PIs on a number of successful TESS proposals, and have benefited from the experience of running their own population-based experiment.  In addition, graduate students and undergraduates have benefited from the incorporation of TESS data into courses on research methods and statistics across the country, providing young scholars with manageable experimental data sets on which to develop their analytic skills. And graduate and undergraduate students will serve as Research Assistants, gaining hands-on experience in all aspects of TESS .  TESS also broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, both as investigators and research participants.  At the heart of TESS? mission is the democratization of access to high quality, original experimental data, putting the power of population-based experiments in the hands of researchers from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, from all types of academic institutions, and from all stages of career.  And because the TESS data collection platform involves a representative sample, the results of TESS projects reflect the broad diversity of our nation.  Further, the data collection platform enables investigators to oversample respondents from otherwise underrepresented groups, and a number of TESS projects have done so for the express purpose of better understanding psychological, behavioral, or economic processes within these groups',\n",
       " '0417413GA Tech Research Corp - GA Institute of TechnologyManolios CRCD/EI: Integrating Functional Computer-Aided Reasoning into the Computer Science Curriculum This project involves the development of tools, courses, modules, and self-paced online materials that integrate computer-aided reasoning into the Computer Science (CS) curriculum. This project is novel in undergraduate CS education. The use of a state-of-the-art theorem proving technology (ACL2) permits students to get instant, reliable feedback, thereby enabling effective learning and self-paced study. ACL2 is a tool consisting of a functional programming language, a logic, and a theorem-prover, that has been used to prove some of the largest and most complicated theorems ever proved about commercially designed systems. The project involves at least two research challenges: taking a necessarily complex, state-of-the-art, theorem proving system and teaching undergraduates how to be effective users in a portion of a semester, and developing effective courses in other areas, such as hardware design and object oriented programming, that are based on the use of computer-aided reasoning. A sequence of mathematical concepts and mechanical tools, with well-designed graphical user-interfaces, allow students to gradually and seamlessly master ACL2. Integration of computer-aided reasoning into current curricula is accomplished through two courses that make essential use of these tools, thereby giving students a deeper and more complete understanding of the material. The courses cover the following topics: computer organization and design, object-oriented programming using the JVM, theorem proving, and formal methods. One of the undergraduate courses focuses on computer organization and design and the other on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In these two courses, computer-aided reasoning is used to give students a deeper understanding of the material. They are required to think about the properties systems and components under consideration should enjoy and how to prove that these properties do in fact hold',\n",
       " \"To sustainably meet the simultaneous and growing demands for water, energy, and environmental quality while protecting the welfare and tradition of affected communities, a broader view of dams is needed.  To address this need, this interdisciplinary research project will apply a new tool for evaluating the relative costs and benefits of dam construction based on multi-objective planning techniques. The Integrative Dam Assessment Modeling (IDAM) tool is designed to integrate biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives into a single cost/benefit analysis of dam construction.  Each of 27 different impacts of dam construction will be evaluated both objectively (e.g., flood protection) and subjectively (i.e., the valuation of said flood protection) by a team of decision makers.  By providing a visual representation of the costs and benefits associated with two or more dams, the IDAM tool will allow decision makers to evaluate alternatives and to articulate priorities associated with a dam project, making the decision process more informed and more transparent.  The IDAM tool will be an evolutionary step in dam evaluation.  Coupled with event chronologies and hotspot mapping of conflicts, household surveys, public-participatory geographic information systems, and hydrologic modeling, the proposed process will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding the assessment, minimization, and distribution of hydropower impacts across cultural and organizational levels and to engage stakeholders in the design process through a decision theater.Significant intellectual contributions of this project will include the use of a uniquely multidisciplinary, integrative model to understand the effects of dams through a controlled study of a complex social and environmental system in China.  The project will make several pragmatic contributions related to policy and decision making through disciplinary and interdisciplinary investigation.  The project therefore will increase understanding about the interplay of multiple impacts of dam construction in a variety of geographic contexts.  Because this collaborative effort will includes opportunities for research in undergraduate institutions, this project will support high-quality research by faculty members at two undergraduate institutions and encourage the integration of research and education.  Substantial coordination and capacity building will occur across organizations, levels of experience, and disciplines.  A broad dissemination strategy is aimed at strengthening research, teaching, and public outreach about society environment interactions in the U.S., Asia, and elsewhere.  Finally, this decision-support process will yield both new knowledge and accessible tools for improving institutions' ability to manage the social and environmental dynamics associated with dams as agents of change.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards\",\n",
       " 'Quasi-states are secessionist regions that have established internal territorial sovereignty but lack widespread recognition and legitimacy as states. Despite their tenuous and contested status, such regions have long been features of world political maps. A U.S-Russian research team will focus on four quasi-states in the Balkans-Black Sea region - Kosovo, Transdniester Moldovan Republic (TMR) in Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia.  These sites were chosen because of research access, contrasting historical experiences, sources of dispute between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community, and the varied implementation of international norms of refugee protection and recognition of self-determination. Two fundamental research and policy concerns are raised by quasi-states. First, how and why do certain quasi-states endure and, second, why are some more successful at accumulating legitimacy than others?The contested declaration of independence by Kosovo in early 2008 and concern about a precedent effect render these questions particularly timely. The establishment of internal and external legitimacy in the wake of wars that defined the political unit is a key factor in accounting for the robustness of quasi-states. The specific research questions include: a) What is the character and localized distribution of the agricultural, industrial, trade, social and political dynamics of the unrecognized quasi-states? b) What factors (war experience, governance structure, nation-building and identity construction, migration or displacement, border relations and international control) helps explain these distributions? c) How do state-aspirant elites work across a variety of scales to promote legitimacy, in the wake of the Kosovo precedent? d) How appropriate is it to make comparisons between these 4 cases? e) How does the enduring of quasi-states affect global norms concerning ethnic cleansing and violence?To overcome potential difficulties in accessibility and reliability, a multi-methods data gathering approach has been adopted to examine the internal legitimacy of quasi-states across a variety of scales. This includes public opinion sampling of about 1000 persons in each study site (among both residents of the quasi-states and the displaced populations), focus group discussions (including about 400 persons in all) and elite interviews. Public and unpublished statistical data are also analyzed in a geographical information system, incorporating land cover change derived from repeat Landsat satellite imagery over the past 20 years.The four frozen conflicts are outcomes of civil wars in the 1990s that were  characterized by ethnic cleansing, destruction of infrastructure, and deteriorating relations between the countries from which the secessionist quasi-states splintered and external supporters (Russia in three of the cases).   The quasi-states themselves are often marked as grey zones of smuggling (especially drugs and weapons), money laundering, border violations, transit points of terrorists, and refuges of criminals beyond the reach of international law. Without more information about the conditions inside the quasi-states (level of legitimacy with their own populations, the extent and nature of their contacts with the supporting countries, the willingness of the populations to accept territorial compromises or other settlement options, the level of inter-ethnic distrust, and border controls), policy formation and implementation is significantly removed from  facts on the ground',\n",
       " 'The goal of this project is to address a series of interesting open problems in mathematical analysis relating to the Radon transform and its generalizations.  These problems include determining the boundedness of certain multilinear functionals (nonlinear analogues of the Holder-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities) on products of Lebesgue spaces, as well as the understanding of the regularity of averaging operators (in both the standard and overdetermined cases) on Lebesgue and Lebesgue square integrable Sobolev spaces.Radon transforms and their generalizations are intimately connected to some of the greatest outstanding problems in modern analysis, including the Kakeya conjecture, the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, the Restriction conjecture, and Sogge?s local smoothing conjecture.  The intellectual merit of the particular problems to be studied in this project is that their solutions require significant new theoretical insight, and they are potentially significant steps on the road to solution of some of these broader outstanding problems.A better understanding the Radon transform and its generalizations also may have broader impacts on other fields within the scientific community. Medical imaging, including CT and SPECT scans, NMR imaging, RADAR, and SONAR applications all depend on a deep theoretical and practical understanding of the Radon transform. Optical-acoustic tomography, scattering theory, and even motion-detection algorithms also depend on the Radon transform. All of these fields and more could potentially benefit from insights produced by this project',\n",
       " 'This project focuses on the functional implications of low-frequency rhythms in the basal ganglia and neocortex.  The collaborative effort involves four groups: Kopell, (Boston University), Moore (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Graybiel (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Boyden (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  The project is the first collaborative research effort of the newly formed Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC), a group of Boston Area faculty members from Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Brandeis University and Tufts University.  The aims of the CRC, which fosters research and training, are to map the spatio-temporal structure of brain dynamics and connect these dynamics to brain function.  This is the first project to try to understand from basic electrophysiology the growing literature suggesting that the low frequency brain rhythms are critical for both attention and learning, and that interactions among brain structures such as the basal ganglia and neocortex are central for such functions.  The project makes use of the electrophysiology skills of the Graybiel lab, which is focused on the dynamics of the basal ganglia, and those of the Moore lab, focused on the neocortex, to understand the flow of information between the cortex and the basal ganglia during learning and attention.  This collaboration is enriched by new molecular biology technology developed by the Boyden group.  This technology, in which cells can be activated and inactivated by light, provides powerful new techniques for figuring out circuits by looking at effects of perturbations, even in behaving animals. The experimental work is guided by modeling ideas from the Kopell and Moore labs, and the output of the modeling can be tested almost immediately by the labs for quick feedback and changes.  This CRC project exemplifies a new and transformational way of doing science, bridging the boundaries of disciplines and institutes to facilitate cutting edge research at the forefront of interdisciplinary endeavors',\n",
       " 'Status and stigma are fundamental factors that influence the ways that individuals organize themselves in social groups. Status is a social process whereby persons in groups locate themselves and others in hierarchies of influence and prestige. Stigma is a process whereby members of social groups identify certain attributes as discrediting, subjecting those who possess them to social rejection and exclusion. Research on status processes in groups has identified a number of attributes that act as status markers, including gender, race, age, and education. Research on stigma processes has also identified a number of attributes that are stigmatizing, including mental illness and physical disability. The research literatures on stigma and status have both proliferated in recent decades, but they have operated more or less independently. Mental illness and physical disability, for example, are absent from research on status processes in groups. Research on stigma, in turn, does not typically attend to status-related outcomes such as influence and performance evaluations. The investigators will carry out three studies that address areas of convergence and departure between status and stigma processes in groups.The first study is an experiment to be completed at the University of Maryland to investigate responses to an attribute identified in prior research as a status marker (educational attainment), attributes identified as stigmatizing (various categories of mental illness), and an attribute identified in research as both a marker of status and stigma (race) in order to determine ways in which reactions to the attributes overlap and diverge. The second project, to be completed at Columbia University, is a study of implicit attitudes toward persons with mental illness. Unlike self-report measures of attitudes that require the attention and control of individuals, the expression of implicit attitudes is spontaneous and unintentional. The major advantage of implicit measures is that they have the capacity to overcome social desirability biases that are common in other types of attitude measures. The third project is an audit study to test for status- and stigma-related outcomes of mental illness in employment decisions. The study involves sending job applications to employment listings, varying whether the applications specify a history of mental illness.By employing multiple methodological approaches as well as variables and measures that represent both traditions, the three studies have the potential to significantly push forward the independent research literatures on both status and stigma processes in groups. The studies also have the capacity to inform intervention programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness. Although there have been several recent calls for interventions to reduce the stigma of mental illness, most of these interventions have not included a research component. Because the interventions with the highest likelihood of success will be grounded in basic research, and because poorly grounded interventions may result in wasted resources and pessimism about our ability to reduce stigma, the proposed studies represent an important complement to more applied approaches to eradicate the stigma of mental illness',\n",
       " 'The inclusion of Muslim immigrant communities is arguably the most demanding political challenge facing liberal democracies in Western Europe. A large research literature has addressed one dimension of this challenge -- the rise of radical right parties (e.g., Stubager 2008; Green-Pederson and Odmalm 2008; Bjørklund and Andersen; Togeby 1998).  An emerging literature is documenting another dimension - the conflict of cultural norms (e.g., Sniderman and Hagendoorn 2007). This project explores potentially the deepest strain of all - between the norms of liberal democracy on the one side and the requirements of religious inclusion on the other. The Danish  Cartoon Crisis  is one of the most dramatic examples of the strain between the values of liberal democracy and the honor of the Muslim faith. Denmark is accordingly the focus of this study. But its findings have broad relevance to liberal democracies in Western Europe. This exploratory study focuses on two questions. First, does an intense clash over colliding values increase popular intolerance toward Muslim immigrants? Second, is popular opinion responsive to elite interventions in support of democratic values? The answers to these to questions will help illuminate the scope of choices open to political leaders during moments of crisis. If the answer to the first question is no, and the answer to the second yes, political elites have room to chose policies that are experimental and inclusive. If the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is no, political elites have less room to maneuver and will be under, at least in the short run pressure to adopt  tough on Muslim  policies -- for example, making the standards to acquire citizenship more demanding. For its empirical base, this study relies on three separate - but temporally overlapping - surveys of the general public conducted under the direction of Professor Lise Togeby. This set of partly overlapping surveys provides a unique record of public reactions spanning two distinct intervals -- when the Cartoon Crisis was in the forefront of public attention and when it had receded into the background. The surveys also include randomized experiments that both replicate previous research and extend it in innovative ways',\n",

       " 'Significance and importance of the project.  The initiation of earthquakes on faults in the Earth?s crust is controlled, incredibly, by physical processes that occur at microscopic contacts between rough surfaces of rock that touch along the fault.  Despite the success of empirical friction equations in describing the results of laboratory friction experiments and producing a variety of earthquake-related phenomena in computer models of earthquakes, these equations lack a physical basis.  That is, the precise identity and nature of the physical mechanisms that  occur at microscopic contacts, and give rise to the observed friction effects in experiments, remain unknown.  The empirical nature of the descriptions reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying the physical processes at microscopic fault contacts.  Without a sound physical understanding, we remain limited in our abilities to reliably apply the equations to earthquakes in nature, to obtain a better general understanding of the earthquake process, and to ultimately make reliable predictions of earthquakes.  In this transformative study, we will make use of state-of-the-art materials science testing methods, namely atomic force microscopy and Nanoindentation, to provide a physical basis for friction observations at a coarser scale and thereby gain a much improved understanding of the earthquake process.  This work may allow us to learn whether we are likely to be able to detect accelerating creep on faults just prior to an earthquake and thereby predict earthquakes days to hours before an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to the built environment.  From the perspective of the scientific fields of mechanics and materials science, these new insights, gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales, have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. Technical description. The overarching goals of the proposed studies are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at asperity contacts at frictional interfaces.  A more specific major goal of our study is to understand the origin of the friction state ?evolution? effect in rate and state friction, the simplest manifestation of which is an increase in ?static? friction with the time of quasi-stationary contact.  To that end, we will conduct a coordinated, interdisciplinary collaboration that will employ laboratory experiments that investigate frictional phenomena over a wide range of length scales. One outcome will be to develop constitutive equations that will allow extrapolation of these mechanisms to the elevated temperatures and longer times relevant for earthquakes. We will perform macro-scale friction experiments on rocks at Brown University, micro-scale to nano-scale indentation creep, adhesion, and friction experiments in the Nanoindenters at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and nano-scale adhesion and friction experiments in atomic force microscopes at the University of Pennsylvania. To make connections between the different types of experiments and to isolate different origins of the state evolution effect, we will vary the same environmental conditions in all three sets of experiments. These include tests as a function of humidity, pH (in liquid), and temperature. All three environmental factors have been demonstrated to influence the evolution effect in macroscopic rock friction experiments. Nanoindentation and AFM measurements should allow us to determine the processes on an asperity scale responsible for the macroscopic behavior',\n",

       " 'This project has four key focus areas which are designed to provide opportunities for student learning, retention and success. The Outreach component targets the K-12 system to foster science exploration and success with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of students choosing STEM science careers. At the college level, the project will increase enrollment of STEM science majors through the development of new courses and programs. For retention of STEM students, the project will foster increased opportunities for student success.  To increase completion/transfer/four year graduation rates, TMCC will initiate partnerships with four year schools to upgrade its curricula, initiate joint research and aid students in developing familiarity with four year schools. The project will conduct an in-depth review and revision of the existing TMCC science courses.  This effort meets two critical needs: enhancing student learning by providing more hands-on activities and ensuring the curricula is consistent with the standards at four year schools.  In the latter area, the project will foster partnerships between the college and four year colleges.  These partnerships are expected to bridge the rural isolation experienced by the TMCC faculty and provide four year school familiarity to students prior to transfer.  As this project is the demonstration of how involvement in learning impacts student achievement and career choices, it is applicable not only in STEM subjects but across the curriculum.  The current literature suggests student learning is heavily impacted by how engaged the student is in the learning process.  Using a results driven approach, the project will identify what enhancements positively impact student learning not only at the college level, but across the continuum of education.  The results of this project can be replicated not only at the college level but in K-12 Native American programs',\n",
       " 'Whereas all nations are exposed to the same dominant scientific consensus established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, their reactions to this knowledge are highly variable.  National stances toward global climate change cannot be explained by levels of prosperity or immediate vulnerability to disaster.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine the key sociopolitical variables that affect how national polities react to scientific knowledge.  Multiple constituencies form networks of action that effect national policies.  Countries vary in the extent to which leaders of government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, and other influential actors take the scientific claims seriously, assigning high levels of risk and urgency to the problem and developing countermeasures.  Advocacy coalitions for and against remedial action vary in strength in each national context.  Their beliefs, activities, and effectiveness reflect concepts of organizational and national interest and cultural receptiveness to scientific reasoning.  Domestic scientific establishments vary in their capacity to certify climate science claims and diffuse this knowledge.  Among these multiple groups, opportunities for cross-stakeholder participation and dialogue will strengthen national agreement, empower authorities, and lead to more effective national countermeasures.  This project will compare the climate change policy-formation processes of developed (Japan, the United States, Germany, and Sweden), transitional (Russia), and developing countries (India, China, and Brazil) as well as at the international level.  Policy network analysis will be used to study these relational processes.  Comparable surveys in each country will collect data on networks of negotiation, communication, and support among pertinent domestic and international organizations as well as organizational beliefs, goals, resources and policy engagement.  Data collection will take place in 2009-2010 at the height of international negotiations over the post-Kyoto global climate change regime.This project will contribute significantly to knowledge about climate change politics and decision making while also strengthening climate change educational capacity in all the countries, especially in the developing and transition countries.  Women lead four of the nine case research teams, which include multiple ethnic/racial groups and will strive for inclusion of national minorities.  Each team will establish a national center for sociopolitical research, education, training, and public information on climate change.  The teams and centers will form an enduring global network and scientific community, holding regular conferences and workshops and issuing reports and publications.  The project plans repeated surveys at regular intervals.

       " 'Anger biases perceptions of risk, which can fundamentally shape leaders? most critical decisions. In one early experiment, the PI found that individuals who felt angry tended to engage in riskier behaviors than did individuals in a neutral emotional state. Having discovered this connection between risk-taking behavior and anger, the PI will explore the effect more deeply by comparing the behavior of participants from the general population to those of elite leaders.The large, diverse sample of high-level decision makers - representing governments, militaries, non-governmental organizations, and corporations will participate in a series of programmatic experiments. Simultaneously collecting biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional data will allow the research team to draw implications for real-world behavior. the team will examine whether anger triggers optimistic responses even when real behavior is measured, real money is at stake, and angry people are compared to those in a neutral state. The PI will also interview our leader-participants to learn about their decision making in a less structured format.As an example, one of the planned experiments will examine the degree to which leaders adhere to long-term goals and strategies rather than being distracted by presently salient information. Specifically, the PI will study whether and how anger and accountability affect the tendency to focus too many resources on an immediate, temporary solution at the cost of a long-term, permanent gain. She predicts that angry participants, as compared to neutral participants, will focus so much on winning battles that they will ultimately lose the war. She also predicts that angry participants who are accountable only for their end result will take a more long-term strategy than those accountable for short-term decisions, while angry participants who have no accountability will fall in the middle.

       " 'Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, lead institution), the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Boston University (BU) are jointly proposing to establish an Engineering Research Center for Smart Lighting under the direction of Fred Schubert, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.The integrated research, education, and technology transfer of the Smart Lighting ERC will demonstrate revolutionary lighting systems for rapid diagnostic bio-imaging, high-efficiency displays, safer transportation, and novel modes of communication. The critical enabler for advanced lighting systems will be a new generation of smart light sources whose spectral composition, color temperature, polarization, spatial, and temporal modulation properties are fully controllable and tunable. Smart light sourcesand advanced lighting systems will result in tremendous benefits to society and humankind, including: Fundamental advances in biotechnology for rapid and highly specific identification of cells. Brilliant displays with high efficiency and large color gamut enabled by polarized emitters.Increased safety in transportation systems through the implementation of ambient intelligence. Novel modes of communication, networking, and sensing.Reduced pollution and global warming through energy-conserving, mercury-free lighting.Reduced dependency on sleep-inducing pharmaceuticals, reduced risk of cancer, and support of the natural circadian rhythm, thereby enabling higher productivity and a better quality of life.These benefits will be realized through the systematic exploration and development of smart-lighting principles in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (1) novel materials, (2) device technology, and(3) system applications and impacts. As envisioned, the center will create a unique and focused program in which faculty and students from a wide range of disciplines come together with industry, government, and non-government agencies to work toward the following objectives: Conduct fundamental research to develop Smart Lighting. A strategic analysis has identified the critical attributes of future controllable light sources, and their underlying materials technology necessary to enable new and revolutionary functionalities that go far beyond present capabilities. At the device level,these attributes include polarization control, novel low- and high-index nanostructured materials, nanoepitaxial methods, photonic crystals, and novel types of phosphor distributions. These core innovations will be integrated into working devices and systems that are adaptable, controllable, and manufacturable. Testbed systems that use the devices will demonstrate advances in biomedical, display, transportation, and network communication technologies. Establish a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary education and training program in Smart Lighting for students and professionals. The hands-on special education program Science You Can See, to be integrated with ERC educational materials, will increase the interest of a broad and minority-rich pre-college and undergraduate audience in science and engineering. Rapidly transfer knowledge to the commercial sector and commercialize validated products. This will be achieved by working side-by-side with established firms and small startup companies in the concept,development, and validation stages of smart-lighting products. Providing industry with rapid access to key results while aggressively pursuing knowledge transfer and securing intellectual property. Increase diversity through a focused effort to attract, educate, and advance women and underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities within the ERC pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate programs, and, ultimately, enable successful careers in Smart Lighting and related industries.Intellectual Merit: The ERC will establish a world-class program in Smart Lighting that will dominate scientific discovery and technological innovation in a new area of photonics. Research and education programs will lead to revolutionary advances in fields as diverse as biotechnology, display, transportation, and networked communications technologies.Broader Impact: The ERC, through rapid commercialization, interactive education programs, and diversity outreach programs, will increase the competitiveness of US industry and make Smart Lighting productsand benefits available worldwide. Additional key participation will come from strategic, corporate, and foreign academic partners.

       " \"This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Florida State University investigates the self-assembly of cholesterol and polyunsaturated lipids in the lipid bilayer and their structural effects on the cell membrane. This proposal is to develop understanding of the fundamental physics behind the cell membrane, and will undoubtedly lead to new medical technologies in the future. In addition, self-assembled biological structures can be tailored to a variety of applications for templating and the formation of nanostructures. This proposal focuses on the study of membrane systems using grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) and resonant x-ray diffraction. Using in-vitro lipid mixtures, the PI will investigate the effects of biologically active molecules on the structure and physical properties of the lipid bilayer. Cholesterol is one of the most important components of the cell membrane, and through interactions with other lipids, it may influence membrane protein function significantly by affecting membrane properties or by inducing phase separation into lipid 'rafts'; areas of the cell membrane with a differing composition to the surrounding regions.  In this project, polyunsaturated fatty acids will be incorporated into biologically relevant lipid bilayers and their interactions with cholesterol. This interplay is highly relevant to membrane properties in the retinal rod cell outer segment, where high concentrations of highly unsaturated lipids occur, but their functions are not well understood. To carry out this work, the investigators will use synchrotron x-ray techniques to study bilayer structure in different lipid mixtures, particularly in plane ordering.  Fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy will complement this work, giving information on macroscopic membrane structure and phase separation. Despite the importance of biological physics and the relevance of cellular structure to the living organism, undergraduate life-science students remain largely unaware of the physics of bio-molecules and their interactions on the nano-scale, where fundamental forces control the assembly of all supra-molecular structures found in the cell. This proposal aims to introduce students in life-science majors with an aversion to physics, to the world of bio-molecular interactions and their importance. By developing a major new course,  Biomedical Physics , the PI is working to introduce physical science topics to the undergraduate student population in novel, biologically related ways.  A key focus is to attract female undergraduate students in life science majors to experience research in physics and to encourage them to pursue a career in biophysics. The PI will also teach an undergraduate course in condensed matter physics that includes more advanced topics in biomolecular assembly and soft matter to the traditional condensed matter topics. These courses will be complemented by the development of a major new web-site  softmatterworld.org  focusing on soft-matter physics, a significant proportion of which will involve biophysics and bio-molecular self-assembly\",\n",
       " 'The core of this project is the setting up of a research network, initially between four researchers, in three institutions, supporting interchange between them (Robert Adler, Technion, Jonathan Taylor, Stanford, Shmuel Weinberger and Keith Worsley,  Chicago) and, more importantly, their students. They will study problems related to the geometric characterization of random structures, such as topological invariants of excursion (nodal) sets of random fields and learning the homotopy and  homeomorphism types of manifolds in the presence of noise and developing techniques for quantifying the statistical accuracy of  the resulting estimates. Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing  non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications  natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is  non-Riemannian.The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey. The four PIs come from a variety  of intellectual backgrounds and are specialists with different, but complementary technical skills. Not only will this project join these skills, but over the next two years a number of other researchers will be added to the project, strengthening, among other aspects, its international component and extending to the training of young scientists in the US',\n",
       " \"There are two problems suggested in this proposal for further investigation. The first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds\",\n",

       " \"The mental process humans use to comprehend a sentence, like this one,can be simulated by automata.  These automata are specific kinds of computer programs that, when run, mimic the steps cognitive scientists think occur between the point at which people read or hear individual words and when they know what whole sentences mean.In this project, the research team is constructing automata in which three factors, usually studied singly, are combined.  The first factor is the linguistic grammar, which characterizes what people know when they know a language.  The second is the control strategy, which determines the particular order in which comprehenders deploy this knowledge in time.  The third factor is the theory of memory for words and phrases.  The researchers expect these triply-endowed automata to match human performance in a variety of sentence types.  In addition, since automata can be mathematically altered to take into account alternative grammars, memories and control strategies, they can be used to gain insights that would not come easily from behavioral experiments with real people. For example, behavioral experiments with elderly adults might show the effects of reduced memory capacity on the sentence comprehension process.  However, using automata allows the researchers to selectively alter not only memory but also control and grammar, revealing the role of each in ways that human experiments could not.  Similarly, mathematically rendering the automaton's grammar more Spanish-like (as opposed to English-like), for example, could also yield a deeper understanding of how the three factors interact and, more broadly, how people understand one another\",\n",
       " \"The human brain is distinguished by costly energetic demands and enhanced plasticity. This combination of factors underlies some of the most unique cognitive capacities of our species. The brain's capacity for learning is greatest during childhood and involves the formation and refinement of new neuronal connections. This process is driven by high rates of energy consumption. This research project will identify the genetic changes during evolution that brought about the human brain and explore the causal link between the development of brain plasticity and metabolism. A major aim of this project involves charting the changes in the brain's energy utilization during the different maturational stages of humans. To accomplish this goal, the interdisciplinary team is using positron emission tomography scans of brain glucose consumption over the course of development from birth to adult stages.  These results will be integrated with the patterns presented by RNA and protein data on the thousands of genes that are expressed at changing levels in different brain regions across the same developmental stages.  Comparative data on the developmental expression of proteins and neuron morphology in great apes and macaque monkeys are also being obtained to determine whether the progression of molecular and cellular changes in human brain development are distinctively different from our close relatives.  The investigators expect to find coordinated expression patterns in brain energetic and brain plasticity genes showing evidence that adaptive evolution occurred in their regulatory machinery during the origin of humans.  The results should provide important clues about the organization and function of the molecular machinery that underpins the type of human brain plasticity that gives our species its exceptional capacity to incorporate experience and learning into the production of culture.  By focusing attention on brain energetic and brain plasticity genes that show adaptive evolution during recent human ancestry but are currently fixed across human populations, this project's focus on shared genes that define human cognitive abilities reinforces the conclusion of a common humanity.  Thus the results of this project should be of interest to the general public and to scientists across a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropology, neuroscience, molecular evolution, bioenergetics, endocrinology and pediatrics.  Experimental determination of total brain energetics during growth will enhance our ability to understand the age-specific tradeoffs that the acquisition of larger brains would have required during human evolutionary history, while also providing a new context in which to understand metabolic diseases such as diabetes.  Furthermore, this project will advance research and education by providing training opportunities for individuals at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels\",\n",
       " \"The project develops and implements recent  Fourier continuation alternating direction  (FC-AD) high-performance algorithms for nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDE), validates such solvers via comparisons with experiments and well-known approximations, and applies the resulting methodology to realistic medical configurations. A significant portion of the effort will design strategies to expand significantly the applicability of High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) (an emerging minimally invasive therapy that uses focused ultrasound beams to cause localized destruction of cancer tissue), and to enable design of optimal HIFU therapies for liver, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. In HIFU, an ultrasound source acoustically contacts the patient's skin to produce a high-amplitude ultrasonic field within the body that focuses on (and heats) a target region---thus leading to tumor destruction. The ultrasound propagates within a medium that is highly heterogeneous---most strongly so due to bone---thus affecting heating, which arises, for example, through perfusion by large blood vessels. Optimal HIFU requires a treatment-planning computational tool, which ensures treatment of the targeted zone and minimal impact on the surrounding tissue. Because previous 3D PDE solvers are more expensive, solution of such complex HIFU problems has not been possible. Using alternating directions and a rapidly convergent Fourier series for non-periodic functions, the proposed FC-AD method has provided for the first time high-order unconditionally stable numerics for general 3D domains at a cost that grows only linearly with the size of the spatial discretization; preliminary tests have demonstrated the capability of the FC-AD method to address satisfactorily the types of nonlinear acoustic problems under consideration. This approach will make possible the study of the effect of heterogeneity on field focusing, heat deposition, and ablation properties - enabling highly optimized HIFU treatment. The associated geometric/computational demands provide a powerful driving force for additional developments of our solvers, geometry modeling tools, etc. The proposed multi-disciplinary interactions will further significantly the state of the art in all three fields: computational science, nonlinear wave physics, and cancer therapy.Broader Significance of the Project:  Already a well-established technique for medical imaging, ultrasound is seeing widening use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications ranging from tumor detection, to kidney stone destruction, to targeted drug delivery. Both the accuracy of ultrasound images, and the precision and reliability with which ultrasound can deliver energy or modify the structure of tissue, depend critically on the type of software that will result from this effort, providing a capability to predict the propagation properties of ultrasonic fields in biological media. The resulting methodology will be applicable across the broad spectrum of biomedical ultrasonics - enabling rapid instrument prototyping, treatment planning, and ultrasound safety assessment. Although the work plan is focused on the modeling of HIFU-based cancer treatment, the potential for effecting key advances in multiple therapeutic and diagnostic applications is very significant\",\n",
       " 'The use of digital maps, imagery and global positioning system (GPS) receivers to support a range of field survey activities is perceived as an area that has potentially high payoff in terms of reduced costs and improved data quality for national surveys.  At present, however, appropriate survey methods for effectively using these resources are lacking.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theoretically grounded yet practical approach for designing computer-assisted survey instruments that rely on geospatial resources to support location-based field tasks.  The project will contribute to this goal by developing naturalistic decision-making models for distinct location-based survey tasks that reflect the diversity of strategies that result from individual differences (e.g., in spatial ability), and by developing model software interfaces that accommodate variation in strategies for using computers and integrating environmental and digital geospatial information.  The work will begin with building naturalistic decision-making models to describe a survey task referred to as address verification, which involves evaluating whether the location of a housing unit on the ground is accurately depicted on a map.  The model will describe how task implementation varies in relation to individual abilities, such as mental rotation of spatial objects, perspective taking, and spatial memory.  The approach involves outlining a high-level naturalistic decision-making model to describe cues (information) available to and selected by a field staff member, hypotheses (if any) that are formulated from this information, and the action selected that leads to completion of the task.  Using this template, a series of more specific models will be created that describe how variation in spatial ability affects the decision-making process.  Expert evaluation and field-based cognitive walk-through methods will be used to further build and refine models.  With the understanding gained from these decision-modeling investigations, models of two user-interface views will be developed for the address verification task.  The first user-interface view will be a basic interface that provides the required map functionality without taking any user differences into consideration.  The second user-interface view will be designed to be an inclusive interface using what was learned in our modeling research.  Information on variation in field behaviors (e.g., preferred cues, map use, task order) in relation to spatial ability will be used to create the set of screens for the inclusive user-interface views.  Survey field experts and cognitive psychologists will evaluate these draft screens in relation to their knowledge and experience with field staff behaviors.  This research is an important first step of an iterative process to develop interface design principles for location-based survey field tasks that rely on an inclusive software design approach to accommodate individual differences. This research will make several substantive contributions to both basic and applied science.  First, the project will begin developing a theoretical approach for effectively incorporating geospatial information resources in computer-assisted instruments for field surveys.  Through this process, naturalistic decision-making theory will be extended to include heterogeneity in individual abilities, specifically spatial ability. In addition, user interface design approaches will be broadened to handle the context of geospatial data for a task involving scientific protocols.  The practical impact of the research will be felt in fielding surveys with improved field operations efficiency and enhanced quality of data and survey estimates for the national statistical infrastructure and other large-scale surveys.  This project will provide students in human-computer interaction, computer science, and statistics with a substantive experience with interdisciplinary and inter-organizational research collaboration.

       " \"Humans are remarkably adept at recognizing the actions of others, even based on movement patterns alone. This ability is most dramatically shown by  point-light biological motion  animations, in which just a few dots are visible, placed at joints or other critical places.  It is often easy to recognize which action is being performed, what the actor's emotional state is, and even who the person is. Although we know this information is available, little is known as to how it is perceived. This is particularly interesting because visual motion and form cues are assumed to be processed in parallel and independent streams, yet these two types of information have to be combined for point-light displays to be meaningful. Neuroimaging studies in humans have further linked biological motion perception to a regions of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus, which seems to be involved in many complex processes including social perception. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Emily Grossman at the University of California Irvine will investigate the perceptual means for the recognition of biological motion, and the brain systems involved. The perception tests will use a novel behavioral technique in which perceivers make yes/no decisions about biological motion animations viewed on a computer screen.  The brain work will use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to test specific hypotheses of the combination of form and motion cues in biological motion perception. These experiments will also measure the tuning properties of brain regions supporting biological motion perception, something that has already been achieved in monkeys but not yet in humans.Theories of biological motion draw from a number of scientific domains, including research in visual perception, social perception, action understanding and motor imitation (the  mirror neuron  system). Results from the present project will influence thinking in all of these domains. The work in this proposal also involves hands-on research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, including the design and analysis of neuroimaging studies. Because UC Irvine and Dr. Grossman's laboratory both have a historical record of recruiting an ethnically diverse student population, these projects provide the opportunity to promote science among under-represented minorities. Finally, as part of the pedagogical activities in this CAREER proposal, this project will support the development of a new Neuroimaging Laboratory course in which students are trained in the practical skills necessary for brain imaging data analysis, a skill highly desirable in the upcoming cohort of cognitive neuroscientists\",\n",
       " 'This project examines the structure and dynamics of social networks in the prehispanic U.S. Southwest. It examines the period of time between A.D. 1200 to 1550, when there were massive displacements of population that coincided with the formation of large, aggregated villages throughout the area. Using information culled from unpublished and published reports, museum collections, and limited archaeological fieldwork it supplements an existing database of known Native American settlements in the region that was developed with prior NSF funding. The project has five major goals. First is to add material culture information (especially ceramics and obsidian) to an existing GIS that contains only spatial data developed by the Center for Desert Archaeology. This GIS database includes roughly 2000 late prehispanic sites across the Southwest. Second is to characterize the structure and dynamics of social networks in the area during a period of great population flux and pan-regional interconnectivity. The third is to apply new methods and theories of social network analysis from sociology, Geographic Information System (GIS), physics, and mathematics to archaeology. Fourth, researchers are to test current theories about network structure and change using high-resolution archaeological data. And fifth, the researchers are to integrate social network theory with powerful tools of spatial analyses such as GIS. Southwest archaeology has the potential to provide a  deep time  perspective on the rise and fall of social networks within a relatively controlled and circumscribed environment. Social network analysis has largely concentrated on contemporary examples and this is the first application of social network theory and methods to a regional archaeological database that measures change over centuries and that is more analogous to the kinds of interactions that take place in many non-urban settings throughout the world. Project results are presented in a manner accessible to the public in variety of media, including the Center for Desert Archaeology?s website, public lectures, and widely distributed publications',\n",
       " 'During Leg 205 of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) two boreholes were drilled into active hydrologic formations on the Costa Rica margin west of the Nicoya Peninsula. One borehole penetrated through the overriding plate into the décollement at ODP Site 1255. The other borehole penetrated through the subducting sediment section and plate into permeable igneous basement at ODP Site 1253. These two boreholes were sealed and instrumented with a borehole observatory (CORK), allowing pressure, temperature, fluid flow velocity, and fluid chemical composition to be measured within the formation. The 1.5-yr pressure and two-year temperature, fluid velocity, and fluid chemical composition records collected to date have provided a basic knowledge of formation properties, although fluids within the boreholes had yet to reach steady state with the surrounding formations. The data also provide evidence that tectonic forcing related to subduction results in measurable transients in pressure, temperature, fluid velocity, and fluid composition within the décollement. While the initial data provide a baseline for approaching several important scientific and technical questions, they have raised new key questions that will be addressed from additional continuous borehole data.

       " \"One of the products of human development and population growth is global-scale alteration of the environment, as evidenced by changes in water supply and climate.  Environmental change is also evident in the transformation of ecosystems, with accompanying biodiversity loss, biological invasions, and emerging diseases).  This interdisciplinary research project aims to understand how these changes affect the global pattern of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).  These diseases are a major threat to human health and the economy in the U.S. and elsewhere.  They result in hundreds of thousands of human lives lost annually and tens of billions of dollars to national and global economies.  Despite these impacts and billions of dollars spent on drug and vaccine development, there has been little progress in understanding how anthropogenic changes drive the risk of disease emergence globally, nor in developing predictive and preventive approaches to these threats.  The investigator's main hypothesis is that socioeconomic and environmental changes, together with disease traits, shape global patterns of disease distribution and emergence.  Previous studies have proposed that disease emergence is driven by human population expansion, migration, land-use change, climate change, changes to agriculture and medical technology, increased susceptibility to infection, and other factors.  They will test these hypotheses by integrating global-scale socioeconomic and environmental data sets with biogeographic data on wildlife, human and livestock populations, and pathogen distributions.  First, they will determine the major drivers of emerging infectious diseases by analyzing the linkages among global spatial datasets on recent changes in socioeconomic and environmental data and the global distribution of zoonotic, food-borne, vector-borne, and drug-resistant EIDs.  They then will develop predictive models of current and future risk of disease emergence based on recent changes to and projected trends in human-related drivers.  They will use spatial mathematical models to identify geographic regions where there is high potential for disease emergence at local scales and for pandemic (global) spread.This project will provide education and training opportunities for fifteen undergraduate and graduate students on summer research projects and a postdoctoral assistant.  The investigators will make their databases available online to the scientific community through web data portals.  They will produce peer-reviewed publications, engage in offer media interviews, make conference presentations, give policy-relevant briefings, and work with developing country non-governmental organization leaders who incorporate environmental health issues into their programs.

       " 'Our group plans to develop a novel type of thermal and cold neutron counting detector based on Boron and Gadolinium doped microchannel plates (MCPs). The new type of neutron imaging detectors will be optimized for imaging thermal neutrons with high detection efficiency (up to 50 %) and even higher for cold neutrons, spatial (~55 µm) and time resolution of ~1 ms (or gated detection with gate accuracy 100 MHz with active area scalable to rectangular configuration of 28 x (N*14) mm2. Another attractive feature of the detector will be its ability to be synchronized with the external trigger, allowing energy selective imaging with a pulsed source. The neutron imaging devices will be rigorously tested at a neutron beamline, in collaboration with our colleagues from Nova Scientific. The proposed detection system will greatly facilitate thermal neutron imaging with very high counting rates, sensitivity and resolution, substantially increasing the accuracy of existing experiments (e.g. SNS residual stress profile measurements with the engineering instrument Vulcan, studies of small samples under very high pressures with the high pressure instrument SNAP, fuel cell studies), and may additionally open up entirely new areas of non destructive testing with modern neutron sources. Non-technical AbstractNeutrons are nuclear particles with no electronic charge which are very useful for studying the details of structure at the atomic level. They are particularly useful because they can probe atomic arrangements and study important materials properties such as magnetism and the vibrational properties of atoms in a crystal. However, detecting neutrons has always been a challenge. This proposal plans to use pieces of glass with many fine holes as a neutron detector. The neutrons pass through the holes, interact with the glass at the edge of the holes, and then, because of the special properties of the glass (addition of Boron or Gadolinium) the neutrons are converted to light, which can then be detected. The small size of the holes allows very high precision in locating the position of each neutron, so that images can be constructed. In addition, this detector system can count neutrons at the same rate that they are produced in the best neutron sources, allowing experiments that take full advantage of those new sources',\n",
       " 'This research investigates the way political conflicts are influenced by sacred values, which are values that incorporate ethical or religious beliefs and are associated with human behavior that seems motivated independently of its prospect of success.  Past research has approached the study of political conflicts as though they were between instrumental actors -- people and groups aiming to maximize their instrumental gains and minimize losses. Indeed, rational actor models have long dominated strategic thinking at all levels of government policy. However, many key components of decision-making vary with context, across social relations and domains, and as a function of whether or not a choice has ethical or moral entailments. The guiding hypothesis of this research is that people in political conflicts make non-instrumental judgments and decisions when they conceptualize the issues under dispute as sacred values, such as when groups of people transform land from a simple resource into a  holy site.   Previous research carried out by this interdisciplinary team of investigators has advanced theoretical understanding of sacred values, developed novel methods of studying their impact on political decision-making and negotiations, and demonstrated their role in non-instrumental and often violent choices in political contexts. However, scientific investigation of sacred values is still in its infancy and more needs to be done. Specifically, this research: 1) investigates biological and cultural antecedents of sacred values and the social identity functions of sacred values across cultures, 2) probes the role of sacred values in influencing violent and seemingly intractable political conflict, and 3) uses this knowledge to investigate possibilities of reducing political and cultural conflict.

       " \"Introduction: This proposal seeks to carry out further research on the failure of SSC (the superconducting super collider) project in order to produce an extended monograph on the topic.  As yet, there is no comprehensive history of the SSC that discusses the diverse scientific, technological, economic, and political influences that initially worked together to get the project launched but subsequently led its demise. The research team has already gathered much of the information and has published shorter journal articles on the subject. The primary goal of the project is to fill in critical gaps that the researchers identify in the proposal. To date, they perceive a dearth of in-depth oral history interviews with crucial physicists who did not join the SSC laboratory, and arrangements for such interviews have been made. In addition, none of the SSC project managers have participated in oral history interviews, and a number of them have agreed to do so. The researchers already have records of such interviews with many DOE officials, but there is a serious need to complement these interviews by doing research in documents, which is part of the program of work. Another area that will receive attention is the refusal of the European high-energy physics community to participate as equal partners in SSC. Extended interviews with key European physicists will be done; others will be identified and interviewed as part of the process. Interviews with Japanese physicists have already been conducted, and this material will be incorporated into the monograph that is to be produced. Political aspects of the international components will be integrated into the story. Finally, additional attention will be devoted to providing a considered understanding of the conflicting narratives developed by SSC's supporters and opponents and how that served to shape public discourse.Intellectual Merit:  The reasons for the failure of the SSC were many and complex. The researchers have managed to connect with many of the persons, organizations, and areas which contributed to the final result. Having these components enumerated and their contributions made clear (to the extent that this is possible) will be of great service to the practitioners of particle physics as well as to those charged with stewardship for this science. The resulting detailed presentation and analysis of the history of the SSC will be invaluable in light of the very impressive quantity of materials (documents, interviews, etc.) the researchers will have collected and assembled.Broader Impact:  The final report of this project will be a key contribution to the history of contemporary science, and to an understanding of the development, funding, and support of large-scale scientific-technical-engineering projects. The proposed activity will also result in important contributions to our understanding of the factors responsible for the public and governmental support of basic science, applied science, and technology. These in turn will be valuable resources in the teaching of the interaction between science and technology and the culture at large, and most importantly in the role that international cooperation and international institutions will play in the future when considering such large projects as the Large Hadron Collider, the space station, investigations of global climate change, large scale geophysical projects, and genomics\",\n",
       " 'DRU: Modeling Nuclear Disaster Risk: The Effects of Perceived Risk and Radiation Exposure on Post-Chernobyl Psychosocial and Health Behavior Outcomes in Ukrainian ResidentsRoseMarie Perez Foster, Principal InvestigatorUniversity of Colorado, Boulder, Institute of Behavioral Science, Natural Hazards Centerwith participation of research personnel fromColorado State UniversityAcademy of Labor and Social Relations, Kiev, UkraineProject AbstractThis research project aims to develop models of human nuclear disaster risk that will more scientifically inform the complex psychosocial and health behavior consequences of radiological and other toxic disasters. This will be accomplished through study of a representative sample population exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine ? the largest nuclear disaster caused by an industrial plant malfunction. Previous research on nuclear catastrophes such as Hiroshima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, have clearly pointed out that the psychological and behavior consequences of these events reverberate in the long term, delving deeply into a community?s life for years after they have been exposed to the nuclear accident itself. Anxiety-ridden survivors lie in wait of dreaded illnesses; inhibit employment, social and outdoor activities; restrict family births fearing congenital malformation; overuse substances; and utilize medical services in far larger proportions than nonexposed fellow countrymen/ women (WHO, 2006; Havenaar et al. 2003; Yamada & Izumi, 2002). For some survivors, these behavioral consequences are further exaggerated by serious mental health disturbance and radiogenic cancers. As yet, it remains unclear how much of the long lasting behavioral consequences of radiation disasters are explained by the radiation dose itself; or by a community?s ?perception? of the potential risk it has been exposed to. Our study team will investigate this question.The study will conduct a probability sampling of current residents in the Kiev and Zhitomir oblasts (states) of Ukraine. The research team, consisting of a research psychologist, radiation physicist, hazards sociologist and medical consultant, will: (1) reconstruct levels of radiation dose from exposure to Chernobyl radionuclide fallout for each study participant; (2) measure long-term psychosocial and health behavior consequences of the nuclear disaster in the population and (3) endeavor to understand the complex relationships among radiation dose exposure, perceived radiation exposure, and risk projections for illness. Given its unique combination of scientists, it is the first time that individual external radiation dose from a nuclear incident will be so carefully reconstructed for a study focused on human psychosocial behavioral effects.  The findings will also offer more refined multidisciplinary knowledge on the interaction between physical toxic exposure and the perception of  risk ? a bio-psycho-social conundrum in academic research  (Slovic, 2000). The current study is viewed as having a direct impact on the prevention of adverse psychosocial consequences associated with communities exposed to nuclear accidents. More broadly, the project addresses ramifications of the increasing portent for nuclear disaster events, given the proliferation of nuclear power plants and waste sites; growing capacity of nations to mount nuclear weapons programs; and the potential for political groups to perpetrate radiological terrorism. These concerns for human safety and well-being are paramount at this time. We believe that scientifically derived risk communication and education about these hazards will be powerful tools in mitigating their psychosocial consequences in the global community',\n",
       " 'The investigator and his colleagues propose a new paradigm-shifting approach towards high resolution and high contrast imaging, which combines revolutions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging with equally cutting edge mathematical developments.The approach uses non-linear feedback between the detector and the sample, so that the measured field is fed back to the MRI magnet.  The unstable feedback increases the dynamical contrast between normal and cancerous cells.  This highly nontraditional approach will be complemented by incorporating compressed sensing, a data analysis technique where mathematical algorithms are used to extract specific features and images from a relatively small number of measurements.Finally, multiple sources and detectors, which coupled with compressed sensing and feedback imaging can collect data in parallel will be implemented together, and modern filter-diagonalization techniques will be used to synthesize the data leading to faster images.      Overall, the research and development that the principal investigator and his colleagues propose will revolutionize MRI.  By applying nontraditional measurement and imaging technique, the contrast between tumors and normal areas will be increased many fold.  The increase will be based on the same physical phenomena, chaos, that is used to by birds and jet fighters to quickly switch their direction. The revolutionary paradigm will will eventually make it much cheaper and faster to do an MRI scan, thereby having enormously broad impacts. In 2008, an estimated 1,680,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer, and approximately 670,000 people will die.  Between 10%-35% could have been saved with earlier detection.This highlights the need for improved early detection methods, which could have saved many patients. A large (2-5 or more) reduction MRI acquisition time, which is not feasible with conventional methods, coupled with the enhanced feature resolution native to the proposed approach, will allow for faster and cheaper cancer screening, which is crucial to improved early detection and thus reducing deaths due to cancer.  Besides cancer detection, there are numerous other imaging applications that stand to benefit from significantly decreased scan time and cost, such as industrial sensing (for example uniformity of fruits in agriculture) and homeland security applications, including highly sensitive detection of concealed materials',\n",

       " \"The past several decades have seen a tremendous growth in the depth and breadth of our knowledge regarding social networks.  While the majority of research to date has centered on the study of networks within small communities, the properties of networks in larger populations constitute a topic of increasing interest.  Prior research has pointed to geography as a key factor in network formation, suggesting a spatial approach to the description and modeling of large-scale network structure.  Further progress toward understanding the dynamics of large-scale social networks is hampered by the lack of data on the geographical structure of personal ties, and by the relative paucity of specialized methods for analyzing such data.  The purpose of this project is to address these issues through two basic thrust areas: the collection of novel data on the spatial structure of large-scale social networks, and methodological research that will allow these data to contribute to our scientific understanding of social structure.  The data to be collected will contain information about the spatial and demographic structure of personal ties at regional and national scales.  These data will enable the estimation and evaluation of models for the effects of geography on network structure, and for the impact of social networks on neighborhood-level outcomes.  The methodological research conducted as part of this project will enhance current network models -- which characterize the probability of different types of social ties between individuals -- by including the effects of spatial constraints, geographic heterogeneity, and demography.  These data and methodological contributions will enhance fundamental knowledge about the complex ways that individuals interact with other through space.  To perform these tasks, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team drawn from the fields of sociology, geography, and criminology; the team's research will leverage current developments in network modeling and spatial statistics, as well as computational advances in the simulation of networks with large numbers of nodes.  In addition to expanding our knowledge of the social ties which help knit communities together, the project will create new data and software tools that will be shared with other researchers and educators.  The practical utility of the methodology and tools developed through this project will also be demonstrated with an application of spatial network modeling to the assessment and calibration of information dissemination systems for use during natural disasters and other large-scale emergency situations.  By measuring and modeling the properties of large-scale social networks, this project will yield new insights into the social fabric in which people are all embedded\",\n",
       " 'This proposal aims to transform research in mathematics and computer science by bringing together two major research tracks which have been progressing in parallel (albeit with nontrivial interaction). In mathematics, the object of study in many areas (including analysis, number theory, ergodic theory and combinatorics) is captured by the question: ?What random-like properties does a (deterministic) mathematical structure have?? In computer science, the object of study in many areas (including network theory, error correction, computational complexity and derandomization) is captured by the question ?Can we deterministically and efficiently design objects with specific random-like properties?? The PIs view the two Math and CS tracks (respectively) as analytic and synthetic approaches for understanding the same fundamental pseudorandomness phenomena and its interaction with structure.Computer science has been mostly a passive consumer of mathematics, relying on the mathematical analysis of structures to build desireable objects. We propose to transform this one-way use to a full fledged collaboration, through the use of the computational view of randomness to analyze mathematical structures. Preliminary applications of this tool, many by the PIs, have already led to major breakthroughs both in new understanding of mathematical objects and in the use of these objects as the basis for constructions in computer science. Examples of recent breakthroughs resulting from this cross-fertilization include work on expanders in Cayley graphs, extractors from sum-product theorems, arithmetic (and other) progressions in primes, and the use of Gowers? norms in complexity. Many rely on the conceptual computational tool of pseudorandomness, the inability of any of a class of tests to tell the difference between a random object and the object in question. This notion arose in complexity-theoretic approaches to cryptography, but has since had wide applicability in computer science (e.g. in derandomizing probabilistic algorithms',\n",

The successful assembly of an sHA library will demonstrate the power and advantages of the reactivity-independent, iterative one-pot approach, and the knowledge gained from these studies will be invaluable to the preparation of oligosaccharide libraries in general.Professor Xuefei Huang, with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, will assay the sHA library obtained for their stimulatory activities towards toll like receptor (TLR)-4, an important receptor involved in innate immunity. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides play important roles in a wide range of biological events, such as tumor cell growth suppression, sensitization of multidrug resistant cancer cells, angiogenesis, and immuno-stimulation.

MischaikowCDI-Type II: Collaborative Research: Computational Homology, Jamming, and Force Chains in Dense Granular FlowsThis project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach that integrates new geometrical techniques, modeling, and experiments to address fundamental, open questions concerning the physical properties of granular media and other jammed materials such as glasses, foams, and colloids.  The hallmark of jammed materials is that they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids.  In addition, many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force chain networks when external forces are applied.   Although the existence of force chains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in physical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been unable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them.  Precise identification and characterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces will likely have a transformative impact in many arenas.  For example, financial and energy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high inefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone.  Also, avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of granular media detrimentally impacts mankind.  In this work, we will apply novel mathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain a quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials. The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to students from underrepresented groups.  We will organize education and recruiting trips to predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black schools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the Southeast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including demonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.  During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and technology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups.  To stimulate further student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so that promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical aspects of our research.

       " 'The standard model of particle physics has been very successful in predicting how weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions behave up to energies so far accessible at present accelerators (1 TeV at the Tevatron at Fermilab in Chicago). However many fundamental questions are not addressed in the standard model and the standard model does not incorporate the fact that the neutrino, the lightest particle of spin 1/2, has a small mass. Two candidates for explaining some of the puzzles that exist are extending the standard model by doubling the number of particles via using a Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, which adds a particle of integer spin to every particle of 1/2 integer spin. Thus associated with the electron, which has spin 1/2, would be a scalar particle (0 spin) called the selectron. (This particle has not yet been found). Another approach is to assume our world is a lower dimensional surface (or membrane) in a higher dimensional space. This proposal by two groups, one at the Bartol Research Institute led by Qaisir Shafi and one at the Center for Theoretical Physics at the British University in Cairo, Dr. S. Khalil is to enable four Scientists from each institution to visit the other institution each year in order to foster their collaborative research on Large Hadron Collider related physics.  As further  glue  for the collaboration the proposal is for a Post-doc to be hired at the Center for Theoretical Physics to work full time on the proposed project.  The two teams will investigate both types of extensions of the standard model. This investigation is very important because next year at CERN in Geneva Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start operation and will hopefully find new phenomena that will suggest what the extensions of the Standard Model should be. Other ways of accessing the highest energies come from astrophysical observation of the cosmic background radiation, and by understanding the cosmological implications of extensions of the standard model. More specifically, this group of scientists intends to investigate supersymmetric extensions of the SM and their potential signatures at colliders, in Astrophysical observations and cosmological implications. In particular they intend to study the question of whether Supersymmetry can significantly modify the CP asymmetry in B-decays compared to the SM picture.  They also plan to perform a complete analysis for the minimal extension of the SM gauge symmetry that can accommodate the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, which has been confirmed by many experiments.  The broader implications of this are many. The exchange of students will be an excellent cross-cultural experience for the students. Scientists trained in different cultures often have different ways of approaching solving a problem.

       " \"The Earth is unique among known planets in having liquid water on its surface, a crucial reason for the existence of life.  Explaining how this came to be, and predicting conditions friendly to life elsewhere requires understanding the protoplanetary disk from which Earth and the other planets formed, a complex, interacting system of rocks, dust, gas, plasma, and magnetic fields in orbit around the young Sun.  Many models by different scientific communities have addressed separate aspects of this problem, but none has integrated all the different physical, chemical, and mineralogical processes into a single, general, continuously improvable, three-dimensional, computational model.Our imminent entry into the petascale computing era makes such a model practical for the first time.  This project will be the first serious attempt to develop a complete, multi-physics model based on a global simulation of a protoplanetary disk.  We will include three major physical processes.  First is the turbulence driven by magnetic fields coupled to the partially ionized gas, which determines how fast the disk accretes onto the star and how well dust can stick together to form the building blocks of planets.   Second is the radiative cooling of the disk, which determines the temperature of the disk, and is determined by how dusty the disk is.  That, in turn, is controlled partly by the temperature.  Third, the gas chemistry and the temperature, as well as the dust properties, determine the ionization of the gas, which in turn determines how turbulent the disk is. All of these processes will be included in a common computational framework.  This framework will rely on a novel numerical algorithm for computing magnetized gas flows using simulated particles moving with the gas. This algorithm combines advantages and evades limitations of both traditional grid-based simulation codes and of more widely used particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Our team includes the inventor of this method.With a new, integrated model, we will be able to better understand Earth's position and properties, the properties of other Solar System objects, and observations of extrasolar planetary systems.The funding for this project will support the interdisciplinary training of a graduate student in the areas of meteoritics and astrophysics treated here.

Specifically, this project will investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of the Virgin Islands rely heavily on   Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence, and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing.  Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.Project Major Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation, food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource management.Intellectual MeritThe project will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Broader ImpactsThe research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy.  Research results may be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean',\n",

       " 'PI: Christopher G. Taylor (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)coPIs: Lauren McIntyre, Karen E. Koch (University of Florida; subawardee)Intellectual Merit:  The aim of this project is to define and characterize genes important in the development and function of transfer cells.  Transfer cells facilitate the mass movement of sugars and amino acids from extracellular spaces to the inside of plant cells.  For example, transfer cells are formed in endosperm tissues where assimilates are transferred from maternal tissues to the developing seed. Certain biotrophic interactions are also known to induce the formation of cells with similar function.  Root-knot nematodes induce the formation of multinucleated cells, called giant cells, which serve as the exclusive source of nematode nutrition.  Due to their functional similarities, transfer cells from seeds and nematode-induced giant cells share many of the same morphological characteristics including thickened and highly invaginated cell walls, dense cytoplasm, abundant ER, and numerous small vacuoles and mitochondria.  Cells with transfer cell-like function are eminent objects of scientific interest since their activity involves a number of poorly understood molecular and cytological transport processes and they are crucial for the survival of both plants and specific biotrophic plant pathogens.  Using laser capture microdissection, the transcriptome of transfer cells from developing seeds and from nematode-induced giant cells of Arabidopsis and maize will be examined for genes involved in transfer cell development and function.  Genes unique and common to endosperm transfer cells and giant cells will be examined for their patterns of expression during plant development and nematode infestation.  Sub-cellular localization of proteins will aid in assigning the role of proteins to transfer cell functions.  T-DNA insertion lines (Arabidopsis) and transposon tagged lines (maize) will be used to examine the function of genes (and the proteins they encode) during seed development or nematode parasitism.  Molecular and biochemical analysis of Arabidopsis and maize mutants will provide additional information on the role of transfer cells in assimilate movement.  All research materials will be cataloged and described on a project website (http://www.danforthcenter.org/taylor/) and made available to the research community.  These experiments will provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of giant and transfer cell function and will be of high practical relevance given the importance of root-knot nematodes as plant pathogens and the importance of transfer cells in the formation of seed, fruit and/or biomass. Broader Impacts:  Three approaches to broadening the impact of science will be provided in this project.  First, summer undergraduate interns will get involved in the project through the summer REU internship program at the Danforth Center.  This program is dedicated to fostering an interest and understanding in basic science among students with an emphasis on the recruitment of underrepresented minorities.  Secondly, we will provide summer teacher fellowships through a Research Education for Teachers (RET) program.  The participating science teacher benefits from the knowledge and experience provided by working in an active laboratory.   Thirdly, this project will develop several DNA Microarray Traveling Trunks that teach high school students about microarrays and their uses.   High school science teachers will be trained to use the trunk and develop and administer lesson plans based on microarray technology.   The Trunk program will incorporate lesson plans, equipment, materials, online resources and hands-on student activities to demonstrate the principals of microarrays.  The Trunks will be shared among the school districts, reaching a diverse array of students across the St. Louis and surrounding areas',\n",

Barresi and Co-PI, Dr. Richard Briggs to acquire high-resolution microscopy for research in live cell imaging. The Center for Microscopy and Imaging at Smith will house the NSF supported acquisition of Leica?s SP5 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope with live cell imaging capabilities. Researchers at Smith College, as well as the other institutions participating in the Five College Consortium (Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts), will enter a new frontier of biological research, studying molecules, cells and tissues in the living state. The remarkable flexibility of this confocal microscope will support a diverse array of research topics that represent three unifying themes of investigation based on scale: the study of specific molecular mechanisms; understanding unicellular structure, function and behavior; and analysis of whole organism development and physiology. The proposed instrumentation will directly impact the research programs of 18 faculty from the Five Colleges listed above as well as an estimated 30 graduate students and 80 undergraduates.Smith College is the nation?s largest liberal arts college for women and is among the top schools producing the greatest number of woman pursuing careers in science. Therefore, one of the main purposes of this newly funded instrumentation will be training highly motivated, diverse undergraduates, many from underrepresented groups, including first-generation college students. This modern microscope system will also serve as a focal point for various outreach activities to area schools and summer science programs targeting young women from underrepresented minority groups. Lastly, because of the strong Five College support for this instrument, this confocal microscope will be an important catalyst for inter-college collaborations that would not typically develop. Such interactions can help stimulate new directions and open doors for students to pursue careers in science and research. Because this instrumentation will provide whole new levels of analysis previously unavailable, the most exciting impacts will probably be those scientific findings that cannot even be predicted',\n",
       " \"The project proposes to integrate NSF-funded efforts at the University of Washington (UW) in an innovative way to improve the experiences of underrepresented undergraduate minorities, women and students with disabilities in the College of Engineering.  A primary catalyst for this synergy is the use of the UW's PEERs project (Promoting Equity in Engineering Relationships), which seeks to positively impact the climate of engineering through a cadre of change agents who create and encourage improved and more equitable relationships. The four institutional partners for the proposed collaboration are the institution's:1. ADVANCE Center for Institutional Change;2. Center for Workforce Development;3. Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching (CELT); and4. Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology (DO-IT).These institutional partners will use the PEERs model to enhance the goals of three NSF-funded projects and to leverage lessons learned from the existing awards to work toward improving the climate for and the participation of underrepresented minority, female and disabled engineering students; and provide a foundation for campus-wide replication.  The three NSF awards upon which the I3 project will build include:1.

       "\"Institution: Franklin Institute Science Museum PI: Snyder, Steve Project: ARIEL - Augmented Reality for Interpretive and Experiential Learning Proposal No.: DRL-0741659 PROJECT SUMMARY In partnership with the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education and Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, the Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, test, and pilot an exportable and replicable cyberlearning exhibit using two cutting edge technologies: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The exhibit's conceptualization is anchored in the learning research vision of the NSF-funded workshop Cyberinfrastructure for Education and Learning for the Future (Computing Research Association, 2005).  The incorporation of VR and AR technologies into the Franklin Institute's electricity and Earth science exhibits is an innovation of traditional approaches to hands-on learning and will improve the quality of the learning experience for the primary audience of families with children and elementary school groups. The project has implications for future exhibit development and more broadly, will provide new research on learning on how to incorporate cyberlearning efforts into traditional exhibits. Fifteen participating exhibit developers across the ISE field will assist in the evaluation of the new exhibit; receive training on the design and development of VR and AR exhibits for their institutions; and receive full access to the exhibit's new software for implementation at their informal learning sites.  The technology applications will be developed by Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center--leaders in the field in Virtual Reality design and development. Front-end and formative evaluation will be overseen internally by the Franklin Institute. The Institute for Learning Innovation will conduct the summative evaluation. Research will be conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education on the effects of AR and VR technologies on exhibit learning NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Through programs (including small group conversations, citizen conferences, and public forums) an interactive exhibition, and two research studies that address issues that are fundamental to establishing museums as places of public dialogue and deliberation, this project will engage the general public, policymakers, and caregivers in deliberations around the latest early childhood development (ECD) research. It will also build on an increased understanding of the importance of ECD to expand civic engagement around this urgent social issue. The overall goal of the project is to help its audiences understand child development, how environment and experiences impact development, and what we as a society can do to support our youngest citizens. Specifically, audiences will explore: How the brain develops from birth until kindergarten (or age five); how a childs environment and experiences sculpt the brain, with some experiences enhancing the child's self-control and learning, and other experiences that actually impede development; and what the project audiences can do to ensure that all children have a strong foundation to learn and thrive NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In partnership with the American Chemical Society (ACS) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) will convene two roundtable meetings in conjunction with the ACS National Meetings in 2008 and 2009. The meetings will promote continued, multinational dialogue on establishing effective programs for funding international collaborative research projects in chemistry; and will also deepen the engagement between the U.S. chemical sciences community, the ACS, and the international Union.These meetings will stimulate the further development of productive collaborative activities between international research communities and help advance the development of more effective mechanisms for international collaborative research in chemistry. The meetings will be of widespread and enduring benefit to the community NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Center for Molecular Interfacing (CMI) will enable the integration of well-controlled molecular constituents within macroscopic systems by using graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to achieve molecularly well-defined, reproducible and robust connections. This interdisciplinary and inter-institutional team of researchers will (1) study electrical and opto-electronic properties of graphene-molecule-graphene and CNT-molecule-CNT devices with mechanical adjustability, electrolytic gating, and optical access; (2) use AFM and STM to characterize the molecule-graphene interface; and (3) use advanced laser microscopy to identify and excite individual electrically-contacted molecules. This work will be enabled by the development of novel experimental platforms and techniques, synthesis of molecular architectures of deliberate design and function, and the development of a theoretical framework. Fundamental chemical processes such as self-exchange rates in redox reactions, the distance dependence of electron transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer can all be studied by precisely modulating the spacing in graphene-molecule-graphene structures.These studies will provide the knowledge base to enable revolutionary advances in technologies such as energy conversion and storage, sensing, information technologies, and catalysis. The proposed work combines chemistry andphysics at the cutting edge of science and technology and provides students with collaborative interdisciplinary research training. Particular emphasis will be placed in the recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented minorities at all educational levels.

Participating Institution: Cornell University.ABSTRACTThe goal of this project is to improve understanding of and decision support for evacuation and mass case sheltering in hurricanes. The task of moving tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from a wide geographic area in only a few days or hours under uncertain, dangerous conditions, getting them to safe locations, and keeping them safe until they can return home is an extraordinarily complicated process, and as Hurricane Katrina made abundantly clear, the stakes are high. Despite a lot of progress, recent events and unchecked population growth in hurricane-prone regions assure us that many challenges remain. The traditional, conservative approach of evacuating everyone thought to be at risk is no longer feasible in many areas in which there are simply too many people and too little transportation capacity. We propose a fundamentally new approach. In the past, math modeling in this application has been limited to estimating the time required to clear a region, assuming many characteristics of the problem are uncontrollable input (e.g., shelter locations). Instead, we will develop sophisticated optimization models with an expanded decision frame that focuses on higher-level objectives, such as minimizing life loss, cost, and inequity, and considers the full range of strategic and operational evacuation and sheltering strategies in meeting those objectives, including for example, vertical evacuation and strategically locating shelters. These models will be developed through a tight interaction between sociologists and engineers to ensure they are firmly grounded in the reality of people?s behavior. For the first time, the models will be based on individual hurricane scenarios instead of conservative aggregations of many events, and they will be dynamic, accounting for the fact that officials can update their decisions as an event unfolds and information about the situation changes. The project has 5 main steps: (1) determine a set of hurricane scenarios for use in evacuation and shelter models such that they appropriately represent the full range of possible events, but are few enough to allow detailed analysis with each; (2) conduct focus groups of key decisionmakers and stakeholders to identify and characterize appropriate decision objectives, constraints, assumptions, and possible evacuation and shelter management strategies; (3) using the focus group input, develop two mathematical optimization models?one long-term strategic and one short-term operational?for evacuation and sheltering decisions; (4) conduct surveys of affected citizens to ensure that the optimization model assumptions and results make sense; and (5) demonstrate the models through case studies in North Carolina and Florida. Any evacuation and sheltering planning effort is only as effective as its weakest link, so it requires a broad range of expertise from marine science, transportation engineering, risk modeling, optimization, and behavioral research collaborating closely. We have assembled this expertise on the project team.This project will help begin to transform the way hurricane evacuation and sheltering are conducted in the U.S., addressing many of the known limitations of the current approach. The new understanding and optimization models developed in this project will help local and state emergency managers better plan for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, thus reducing the deaths, injuries, and unnecessary expense associated with poorly planned or executed response in future hurricanes. By collaborating throughout the project with state and local emergency management departments and the American Red Cross, the key agencies in charge of hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we will ensure that study results are disseminated to practitioners as quickly and effectively as possible. Three graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research, each with at least two of the co-PIs on their committees to ensure tight integration. By providing a substantive example of truly interdisciplinary disaster research, the project will help facilitate the transformation of the well-known Disaster Research Center, historically based in sociology, into an interdisciplinary center. It will also help to launch the new interdisciplinary graduate program in Disaster Science and Management at the University of Delaware NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Flora of China (FOC) is an international collaborative project, whose goal is to produce the first complete, English-language account of the approximately 31,500 species of Chinese vascular plants. FOC will result in the publication of 50 volumes, including detailed descriptions of all Chinese plants and illustrations of over 60% of them. All of these materials will be freely available for browsing and downloading via the FOC Web site.FOC is already having a major positive impact on the international scientific community. Upon completion, it will be of great importance to the future of plant science, biodiversity conservation, medicine, education, and horticulture. FOC is also enhancing the infrastructure for scientific research and education by promoting international collaborations among institutions in the United States, China, and Europe. FOC is coordinated by the Missouri Botanical Garden in partnership with ten other actively collaborating institutions. Every text in FOC is co-authored by at least one Chinese and at least one non-Chinese botanist, and the project involves the collaboration of at least 300 non-Chinese and 170 Chinese botanists worldwide. Of these, at least 100 botanists, including and graduate and undergraduate students, are from the United States NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The overall goal of this project is to reconstruct the low-frequency behavior of the climatological Aleutian Low on decadal to millennial time scales, and to assess how its variability has related to past shifts in the mean state of climate during the Holocene. To confidently reconstruct past climate change, the inter-related processes that control the proxy climate indicators must be well understood. This project will continue on-going monitoring and lake-core-based investigations at nine lakes in southern Alaska with the dual aims of (1) understanding the primary controls on the sedimentary changes, and (2) applying this understanding to generate the highest quality time series of paleoclimate proxies that relate quantitatively to summer temperature and winter precipitation. The investigators recently discovered two lakes that contain annually laminated (varved) sediment. These are among the few varved lakes currently known in Alaska, and they present an opportunity to develop annually resolved time series of past climate variability. The low-frequency component of lamination thickness and grain-size variability at these glacier-fed lakes probably reflects the extent of ice cover in the catchment, while inter- and intra-annual variability is likely related to melt-season temperature and hydrologic factors, particularly large rainfall events. In addition to the new laminated lakes, this project will generate complementary records from lakes more suitable for ecologically based proxies, including chironomid and pollen/macrofossil assemblages, and lake-productivity indicators that respond to growing-season temperature. In addition, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms will be analyzed to reconstruct moisture-source variations, and geomorphic evidence will be used to assess Holocene glacier fluctuations within the lake catchments. The intellectual merit of this study includes its multi-proxy approach designed to probe a key feature of ocean-atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific: the Aleutian Low pressure system. This prominent center of action is linked to indices of climate variability across the Pacific. It is most strongly expressed in winter when it steers southwesterly storms inland, thereby governing the spatial pattern of surface temperature and snowfall across northwestern North America. This project includes glacier and glacial-lacustrine records because glacier size depends on winter precipitation, which varies with the Aleutian Low. Glacier size also depends on summer temperature necessitating complementary time series of summer temperature. The basic study design is to pair a glacial-fed lake (lamination record) with an organic-rich lake (chironomid record) in each of three study areas separated by 2100 km: Adak (middle Aleutian Islands) in the far west, Ahklun Mountains in the southwest, and Chugach Range in the Gulf of Alaska. These three areas straddle the prominent dipole in the influence of the Aleutian Low. When the Aleutian Low strengthens, winter precipitation and temperature increase in the Gulf of Alaska, while it decreases in the west. Moisture sources also shift with the Aleutian Low, and these are recorded in the oxygen-isotope ratios of lake water and the diatoms that grow within it. The multi-proxy time series will extend through the Holocene, with higher-resolution analyses over two periods that encompass past warm intervals, namely the Holocene thermal maximum, which took place early during the current epoch, and the last 2000 years, which includes the so-called medieval warm period, a key benchmark for 20th century warmth.The broader impacts of this study involve its synergistic activities with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a premier environmental monitoring program in the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, geoscientists at the US Geological Survey's Alaska Volcano Observatory who are striving to assess the frequency of eruptions of Aleutian Arc volcanoes and to identify widespread tephra-stratigraphic markers, and the broader community of multi- and inter-disciplinary scientists aiming to understand the causes and effects of climatic change around the North Pacific, the Arctic, and globally. This project contributes to understanding climatic variability, a key challenge facing society. The US Climate Change Science Program identifies  Past Climate Variability and Change in the Arctic and at High Latitudes  as one of its primary research objectives. The project is training three graduate and several undergraduate students in global-change research, and supports a Research Assistant Professor in her early career. The PIs have involved high school science teachers in their field research as part of NSF's PolarTREC program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER MAPPING / CHARACTERIZATION / AND ANALYSIS OF CHANNEL/VALLEY FEATURES ON TITAN- Elongate sinuous features interpreted as fluvial in origin have been identified on Titan in data from all three of Cassini''s imaging instruments - the Cassini Titan Radar Mapp NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The proposed workshops will bring together a multi-disciplinary and international array of scholars studying contemporary issues of surveillance and society. In the modern era, issues of security command the attention of policymakers and the general public, both within the U.S. and beyond. Surveillance has become the key mechanism employed in both public and private sectors to contend with the uncertainty raised by threats of terrorism and other criminal activities. With the rise in surveillance apparatuses and security forces, however, public concerns have multiplied, not only about the cost and efficacy of such safeguards, but also about encroachments upon privacy, civil liberties, and public spaces. These tensions have not gone unnoticed by social scientists and humanities scholars studying surveillance.The objectives of these two three-day workshops are 1) to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on contemporary surveillance issues, 2) to map core areas of surveillance research to locate collaborative opportunities and existing research gaps, and 3) to facilitate graduate student training. The choice of participants will provide a balanced representation of both junior and senior scholars, disciplinary training, and international perspectives. The attendees at both workshops will be asked to address a common set of cross-cutting questions aimed at assessing and improving interdisciplinary knowledge on surveillance and society NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing declines and mass mortalities at an unprecedented rate. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis is a primary cause of this epidemic, and differential susceptibility among species occurring in similar environments suggests that genetics may determine how individuals respond to infection. Zamudio and Lips will combine field and laboratory studies to test whether variability in immunity genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) confer differential survivorship to this emerging infectious disease, and how the disease itself alters the genetic and demographic composition of populations following an outbreak. The proposal focuses on frog populations in Central America where chytridiomycosis lethality is prevalent; however, their findings will be applicable to amphibian populations worldwide.This project will provide a better understanding of how emerging diseases shape adaptive molecular evolution, and how variability in immunity genes contribute to the response to novel disease threats. This research will quantify the molecular effects of this disease in ?real-time?, in addition to the genetic determinants of survivorship, resulting in useful epidemiological predictions for other populations or species that have yet to be exposed to the disease NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The United States over the past two decades has seen an explosion of patent awards across a wide variety of technologies, and a dramatic increase in the volume of patent litigation between rivals. Numerous commentators have suggested that the proliferation of these awards, known as  patent thickets , has had socially detrimental consequences since overlapping intellectual property rights may make it difficult for inventors to commercialize new innovations. Patent pools, which can be defined as formal or informal organizations where for-profit firms share patent rights with each other and third parties, have been proposed as a way in which firms can address these  patent thicket  problems. Patent pools have been most plentiful and well established for decades in the information technology and communications industries. In the past few years, the biomedical research community has expressed increasing interest in patent pools as a potential solution for increasingly prevalent patent licensing issues in biotechnology-related fields. This project builds on the existing work on patent pools, trying to understand how the issues faced in the biomedical industries are similar and different to the issues in information technology and communication. The project combines empirical and theoretical research in this endeavor in an academically rigorous manner. The project is deepening our understanding of a crucial  knowledge-sharing organization , an institution, like a standard-setting organizations or open source project, where firms can strategically share knowledge. BROADER IMPACTS For scientists and others interested in innovation policy, this project advances understanding of how patent thicket problems can be addressed, and the strategies that are most likely to be effective (as well as more problematic approaches). The project leaders are ensuring that the findings of the study are diffused in a variety of outreach efforts, in order to insure that the ideas can have the most impact. This takes several forms. First, the project leaders are involving practitioners as well as life scientists in the academic conference that is being organized on this topic. As in earlier projects, the project leaders are participating in the public policy process, explaining their findings. Finally, the project leaders are disseminating the ideas more broadly through outreach to the popular press NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Ohio State University College of Education (OSU), the National Middle School Association (NMSA), and Education Development Center (EDC) are providing a stewardship role for middle level educators of mathematics and science by creating the Math and Science Middle School Pathways Portal, or MSP2. While continuing to create and offer contextualized, high-quality resources, MSP2 is also capitalizing on Web 2.0 tools to promote interactivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among its users. Additionally, MSP2 is expanding its scope of influence through a new section designed for middle school aged youth and new resources related to career development, 21st century skills, and STEM careers. The portal also provides a virtual professional learning community of middle level math and science teachers. Project partners are integrating resources, tools, and services across projects, and supporting multiple methods of resource discovery to meets the needs of this audience. Collaboration among these and other organizations is providing the longer-term sustainability and stewardship of MSP2. The project evaluation is determining the impact of the project on its target audiences and the educational uses of Web 2.0 tools and services.MSP2 enhances the infrastructure for research and education by continuing to develop a contextualized, high-quality resource collection, building and supporting networks of middle grades math and science teachers through a virtual professional learning community, and supporting the educational use of Web 2.0 tools and services. Dissemination of knowledge, experience, and research results is a significant aspect of the project. The project partners are reaching diverse audiences through conferences, meetings, online events, print publications, and Web communications NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This empirical study examines the variety of materials used and the myriad of teaching strategies employed by U.S. high school mathematics teachers in their effort to prepare students for later success in college calculus, a requirement for most STEM majors. Designed as a retrospective cohort study, we use 12,000 college calculus students' histories to predict performance while controlling for demographic differences. This study has the capability to both reveal the most promising educational practices in mathematics, including technological innovations, and to assess the degree of match between high school math and college calculus courses, both traditional and reform based NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This multidisciplinary project draws upon sociology, computer science, and linguistics to study how ideas are created and propagate through scientific communities, how these communities are formed and change over time, and how multidisciplinary networks spanning these communities shape scientific innovation. It creates sophisticated new computational models for extracting and representing ideas and measuring their impact and novelty, and for extracting and representing social relations and identifying forms of multidisciplinary collaboration. Its methods integrate the network analytic tools of social science with the language processing tools of computer science. It uses network analysis to improve the ability of computational tools to identify ideas in scientific texts, as well as the tools of computational linguistics to help explain the co-evolution of scientific collaborations and innovations. The models of ideas and their diffusion can be used to investigate hypotheses such as whether multidisciplinary research accelerates or decelerates scientific innovation, and how multidisciplinarity influences student and faculty careers. A relatively shallow but large-scale study of the MEDLINE corpus is combined with a richer organization-level study of Stanford University faculty (their publications, grants, affiliations, advising, and teaching) in order to explore and analyze the complex interrelationships of innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration.The research agenda of this project is to produce new and unique data, create new computational tools, and extend theory so that scholars change their conceptions of scientific innovation, multidisciplinarity, and research communities more generally. The integration of social network and natural language processing techniques is helping to develop a new vein of research in computational social science, simultaneously offering empirical rigor and scale to the sociology of science and extending natural language processing from its previous engineering focus toward true explanatory social science models NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Several small-scale experimental studies in classrooms by Star and Rittle-Johnson demonstrate the value of comparison in mathematics learning: Students who learned by comparing and contrasting alternative solution methods made greater gains in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and flexibility than those who studied the same solution methods one at a time. This study will extend that prior work by developing, piloting, and then evaluating the impact of comparison on students' learning of mathematics in a full-year algebra course. Sixty Algebra I teachers will participate in a randomized controlled trial of the contrasting-examples instructional approach, using a delayed treatment design NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The University of Colorado is establishing a Distributed Center for STEM Education Research and Transformation that integrates education projects across the campus.  The Center addresses the three themes outlined in the National Academy of Science report  Rising Above the Gathering Storm . These are: (1) Teachers in K-12 education (10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds), (2) Research (Sowing Seeds), and (3) Higher Education (Best and Brightest).  This Distributed Center involves eight traditional departments in three colleges and schools, including: Education, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering.  Existing education projects being integrated into the center include: ADVANCE (Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Careers); Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement projects; Robert Noyce Teaching Scholarship project; Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship projects; and Research and Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering projects NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The overall goal of this project is to investigate joint influences of genetic propensities and social-control on delinquent behavior. Previous sociological work has demonstrated the critical importance of social structural conditions, family processes, school structure, and peer networks.  These serve as informal social controls that bond individuals to social norms and ultimately may reduce delinquency.  The project draws data sources from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to address the question of why some individuals become serious and violent delinquents while others do not, despite growing up in a similar social context and participating in similar social processes.  Dr. Guo and his research teams will investigate the role of genetic propensities, especially as they interact with social control factors, in delinquency.  Specifically, they will use genotype data focusing on the genes that are known to be involved in aggressive behavior in mice to explore how genetic factors might influence delinquency and how those influences may depend on social control processes measured at the levels of friends, peers, family, school, and neighborhood.  This research is based on the premise that genetic effects on delinquency are best understood within a social science theoretical framework, which provides the basis for understanding delinquent behavior as socially produced and socially organized human activity. The newly created molecular genotype data will be merged with the rich social and behavioral longitudinal data in Add Health for other researchers to use.  The results of this study would contribute to the understanding of aggression and delinquency across the life course and could inform intervention efforts NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER TERC is partnering with the Toxics Action Center to enhance the capacity of environmental organizations to teach mathematical literacy skills to low-income citizens, mostly women of color. Secondary collaborators include four environmental organizations around the country. The project is (1) developing math- and statistics-rich educational materials that help non-scientists interpret environmental test results, (2) developing training materials that help environmental organization personnel provide quantitative literacy training to citizens, (3) helping environmental organizations institutionalize project resources, and (4) evaluating the impact of project activities on environmental organizers, community members, and the general public. Project deliverables include bilingual, print- and web-based instructional materials (including videos) for environmental organizations to use with staff and community members; training sessions to create a cadre of environmental organization leaders who can conduct environment-focused, math training workshops; a communications toolkit for dissemination to journalists who cover environmental issues; and a resource-rich project web site NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scientists, inventors, writers, and other creators have attested to the importance of inspiration in the creative process. In contrast, creativity researchers have generally dismissed the concept of inspiration, arguing that ascription of creative insight to the intervention of a supernatural source ( muse ) is outmoded myth. However, it is possible to reconcile creators' accounts of inspiration with contemporary science. Specifically, consistent with creators' accounts, inspiration is posited to be an effect of creative insight, not its cause; inspiration is posited to be a motivational state that is aroused in response to a creative insight and that compels the individual to translate the creative insight into a creative product. This perspective exposes an important gap in the research literature. Creativity researchers have made considerable progress in identifying the cognitive, neurological, and contextual origins of creative insight (thus debunking the notion of Muse) but have largely ignored the state of inspiration that promotes the translation of creative insights into creative products. This oversight is striking, because the failure to translate creative ideas into tangible products is likely to be among the most important obstacles to innovation. This project involves three primary goals. The first goal is to develop methods for the assessment of inspiration and to provide evidence of their validity. Several methods of assessment are being developed, including self-report questionnaires and objective indicators derived, for instance, from digital video of nonverbal behaviors and from electronic monitoring of the creative process. The second goal is to demonstrate that inspiration is a robust predictor of creativity and other socially valued outcomes, including work productivity and efficiency. Several types of creative activity are examined, including invention, scientific writing, and the writing of poetry. In each case, creativity is assessed objectively (e.g., receipt of patents) or through a peer-review process. The third goal is to establish the functional significance of inspiration by integrating it with contemporary theories of personality and human motivation. For instance, the personality traits that predict the creativity of an initial insight are expected to be fundamentally different from the traits that predict the tendency to become inspired to actualize the insight. In addition, mysterious aspects of the subjective experience of inspiration, such as the feeling that one is functioning as the mouthpiece of a power beyond oneself, are expected to be explained by the involvement of implicit (unconscious) processes.This project will have important impacts beyond advancing the motivation, inspiration, and creativity research literatures. For instance, the findings will be widely disseminated in the form of research articles, book chapters, and conference presentations; tools for the assessment of inspiration, known to be predictive of creativity, productivity, and efficiency, will be available for use in the workplace and in educational settings; and policy makers and others concerned with societal adaptation to changing physical and sociopolitical environments will be equipped with well-validated models of the processes through which innovative and transformative ideas are translated into concrete products and solutions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposed project is an empirical study that falls within the contextual research strand of the REESE program.  The aim is to conduct research about STEM education relative to achievement gaps that exist between minority and disadvantaged students and their non-minority counterparts. The outcomes of this study will help in addressing the convergence of several trends that may exact increasing costs to individuals on the lower end of the gap, the economy, and to social and political ideas.   The achievement gap is a deceptively complex scientific problem that will increasingly require studying the origin and evolution of gaps from earliest childhood.  In that regard, this study will integrate research trends in the developmental sciences, the cognitive and neurosciences and economics, and education research and other strands of social science to develop interventions to address gaps in more efficient ways. The first large nationally representative longitudinal data collection will be used for this study.  This large database includes information from nine months to grade eight that will be used to test and compare the leading hypotheses about the origin and evolution of gaps.  To meet the challenge of turning such data into credible evidence that might inform intervention plans and further research, two statistical estimation strategies (growth and econometric models), information from supporting meta-analysis, and an extensive advisory network of experts will be used to conduct the study.  The research will focus on: (1) Building better theoretical and empirical research models directed toward understanding how these gaps develop from conception to school entry; (2) Identifying effective strategies and inventions that might efficiently narrow gaps prior to school entry; (3) Building better explanations about why gaps are so difficult to close during schooling; (4) formulating stronger suggestions about why gaps for some minority groups expand during schooling, while gaps for other minority students narrow; and (5) Identifying the conditions associated with significant positive changes in learning trajectories during schooling for the small proportion of minority and disadvantaged students who narrow their score differences with white advantaged students.Broader Impacts: The study is likely to advance knowledge and discovery in the field in that it brings together researchers from many fields to examine ways to better understand the achievement gap in STEM areas.  The results could benefit education stakeholders interested in improving STEM education for all students.  Potentially, this study could inform and influence current policy considerations regarding mandatory pre-school enrollment, and in that regard could be transformative.  State and local policymakers will assist with dissemination as well as national outlets established through earlier studies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Pruden  0547342  This research opens a new paradigm of viewing biomolecules, such as ARG, prions, ricin, anthrax, etc., as  pollutants . Biomolecules such as these are of increasing health and security concern to society and this program will help to open new approaches to mitigation and treatment. Investigating ARG directly as pollutants using genome-enabled tools, rather than culture-based methods, is an innovative aspect of this research. For the past two years the PI has been studying the spread of ARG in the front range Colorado watershed, which provides an excellent model system for studying the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment because the primary source is snowmelt with minimal anthropogenic input. Thus the PI is uniquely poised to succeed in this research and to make significant contributions to the field. Institutional support is substantial, including newly renovated labs, reduced teaching loads, TA support, travel funding, and mentoring.The intellectual merit of this project will provide a firm foundation for teaching, training and learning.  New courses that integrate MB&B into the engineering curriculum will be further developed, evaluated, and improved. Inquiry-based learning and peer-learning with a laboratory component will be especially valuable for training engineers in an interdisciplinary field. MERGE activities will also specifically address the need for representation of women and minorities by focusing on topics that have been demonstrated to attract underrepresented groups. Graduate students will also benefit from MERGE by actively participating as mentors to undergraduate students and in taking the lead in publishing and presenting the results of their research. Furthermore, students will help organize K-12 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) outreach activities. Results will be broadly disseminated through conducting workshops in partnership with other Colorado/Wyoming universities and withEuropean collaborators (University of Barcelona and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique).  Finally, the overall results will be summarized as best management practices (BMPs), which will be a helpful practical guide to farming and water professionals. The activities are considered to be beneficial  to society in that they will take an important step in involving environmental engineers in helping solve a critical problem that has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most pressing health issues of this century NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project involves the study of Galois groups of extensions of global fields obtained by adjoining preimages of a rational point under iterates of a morphism of varieties.  The inverse limit of all such groups for a given point and morphism form what we call an arboreal Galois representation.  Piecemeal results on these representations have existed for some 20 years, but the PI has recently developed a more unified theory, and discovered several new applications. These include properties of the p-adic Mandelbrot set, sets of prime divisors of non-linear recurrences, and reductions of a given point on an abelian algebraic group. The PI plans to pursue applications further, into the domain of dynamics over finite fields, which is a natural direction. Several cryptographic algorithms, including the Pollard rho algorithm, make use of dynamics over finite fields, and the research proposed here is likely to have applications in this area. Further research plans include the determination of the image of arboreal representations in certain analogues to the case of CM elliptic curves; the further development of the analogy between arboreal representations and linear Galois representations, with the ultimate goal of attaching interesting L-functions to arboreal representations; and finally, an examination of irreducibility properties of iterates of polynomials with integral coefficients.Generally speaking, this projects blends ideas from two a priori different fields, number theory and dynamics.  The study of extensions of the rational numbers Q by algebraic numbers -- that is, roots of polynomials-- is one of the most basic areas of number theory.  The field of dynamics seeks to understand how processes evolve over time, and the most basic dynamical system consists of repeated application (or iteration, as it'sknown) of a map f from a space to itself.  The PI proposes to study the extensions of Q obtained by adjoining roots of iterates of certain polynomials.  Of particular interest are the Galois groups of such fields, namely the group of field automorphisms fixing pointwise the base field. When the Galois groups of all iterates of a single function are taken together, we term it an arboreal Galois representation.  Even in seemingly simple cases such as the polynomial x^2 - 1, this arboreal representation is not well understood.  These representations turn out to encode density information regarding a variety of dynamical phenomena.  Moreover, they furnish an interesting and potentially fruitful analogue to the well-studied case of linear l-adic Galois representations, namely the study of fields whose Galois groups embed in certain matrix groups. These have had a myriad of important applications NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 0804113    PI: Leckband, Deborah      ORG: Illinois-Urbana/ChampaignTitle: Mechanism and Dynamics of Protein Interactions with Polymer BrushesINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  The proposal aims to identify engineering design rules for controlling protein and cell interactions with biomaterials. A central and persistent problem confronting biomaterials design is the uncontrolled adsorption of proteins to material surfaces. There is currently no general consensus on how to design a protein-resistant coating.  A major gap in current knowledge is the limited understanding of the basic mechanisms of protein adsorption to polymer interfaces in aqueous media. Absent this information, it is difficult to define engineering approaches to control specific behavior. This research plan will address this knowledge gap by using a combination of synthetic chemistry and complementary experimental approaches that probe the mechanisms by which proteins interact with grafted polymers. In Objective 1, polymer gradients will be used as high throughput screening platforms to identify polymer brush properties that support protein adsorption. In Objective 2, a combination of fluorescence techniques will quantify the diffusivity of adsorbed proteins as a function of the brush parameters. In Objective 3, neutron reflectivity measurements with deuterated proteins will determine where adsorbed proteins localize relative to the polymer brush. Finally, Objective 4 will quantify the magnitude and range of attractive and repulsive forces between proteins and polymers that are responsible for protein adsorption behavior.  The work will help to develop an understanding of the interactions of proteins with polymer brushes and could advance the design and preparation of surfaces resistant to protein adsorption and biofouling.BROADER IMPACTS:  Success of this project will shed new and useful light on the mechanisms by which polymer brush coatings may protect surfaces from unwanted protein adsorption.  With respect to broadening participation, the project will continue the PI's on-going efforts to involve students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering in the research endeavor.  These efforts will include inclusion of females and underrepresented minorities in graduate level research and participation in the Summer Research Opportunity Program that provides opportunities for minority undergraduate students to participate in research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is supporting expansion and continuation of a successful series of faculty development workshops run by the Geosciences Division of the Council on Undergraduate Research (GeoCUR). These workshops are held in conjunction with annual and sectional meetings of the Geological Society of America (GSA) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and at the national meeting of the Association of American Geographers (AAG). They are designed to help faculty develop and sustain undergraduate research programs. This project is making these workshops available to a wider audience, as well as serving as a means of leadership development for rising and current geoscience faculty. Alumni of past GeoCUR workshops are now actively involved in leadership positions within CUR, and they are facilitators for this series of workshops NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Species in the carabid beetle genus Paussus (340 species) exhibit an extraordinary diversity of unique morphological structures, in part because they are obligate symbionts of ants (i.e., myrmecophiles). The taxonomy of Paussus is in a state of turmoil, as evinced by multiple contradictory classifications of the group. This is to some degree due to the striking phenotypic uniqueness of these beetles, which tends to obscure similarities that can be used to infer evolutionary relationships between species. The objectives of this project are to: (1) infer the evolutionary relationships within Paussus based on DNA sequence data; (2) examine the evolution of morphological characters using the resulting phylogenetic framework; (3) produce a novel species-group classification within Paussus and an electronic interactive key to those species groups; (4) produce a systematic revision of those species of Paussus endemic to Madagascar, one of the most diverse and threatened regions of the world; and, (5) provide georeferenced biodiversity data to environmental non-profit organizations and governmental agencies in Madagascar for science-based conservation planning. The phylogeny produced with this research will provide a stable evolutionary framework for the proposed systematic revision of the Malagasy fauna, as well as for all future revisions and biogeographic analyses within the genus. Analyses of character evolution will reveal patterns of evolution of some very unusual traits associated with myrmecophily. Distributional and life history data, species- and higher-level classifications, phylogenetic hypotheses, and paper and web-based identification tools will be made available to ecologists and conservation biologists as facilitated by Réseau de la Biodiversité de Madagascar (REBIOMA). Throughout this project, the PI will train high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students in morphological and molecular approaches to revisionary systematics research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Inland Northwest Community Access Network (TINCAN), the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology (PSCTLT), and Reel Grrls (a community media center) are partnering to involve 6th and 7th grade middle school girls in science-focused after-school club activities in 10 schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The Science Journalism Pathways to STEM Careers project is engaging girls in science journalism through information and communication technologies (ICT) to investigate and publish information about local science issues of interest to their communities. The ICT focus is video, multimedia, and the Internet. Girls are also conducting hands-on activities and interviewing STEM professionals to learn issue-related science content. The goals of the project are to (1) increase girls' ICT fluency, (2) increase girls' science literacy, (3) increase girls' interest in STEM careers, and (4) increase STEM content in non-science courses taught by social studies teachers who manage the after-school clubs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]Can electoral institutions overcome the political consequences of social exclusion and poverty? What role did political parties play in incorporating the working classes into the electorates of European democracies? And, why are so many Americans, particularly the working and lower middle people, still alienated from participation in their countrys electoral processes? This research begins with the premise that these questions reflect different perspectives on the same political phenomenon: The context of electoral competition especially the rules governing legislative elections and their interactions with the geographic distribution income shapes the incentives of political actors to mobilize and incorporate low-income and working-class citizens. The proposed research contributes to a recommended Collaborative Research Proposal from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition. Earlier accounts of the relationship redistributive policy emphasize a stark division between multimember district (MMD) electoral rules and single-member district (SMD) rules (e.g., Iversen & Soskice 2006, Persson & Tabellini 2000). These accounts, however, miss the important modifying effect of electoral context - specifically, the geographic distribution of citizens of different types - on the effect of electoral rules in structuring legislators' policy-making incentives. The intellectual merits of this proposal lie, therefore, in the recognition that given the national context in which elections are held - in particular, the geographic distribution of income - the electoral institutions of contemporary democracies may undermine the opportunities for those societies to achieve their democratic ideals.As part of a European Science Foundation Collaborative Research Scheme (EUROCORES), the proposed research will contribute to a broadly collaborative and highly integrated project that is motivated by questions about voter turnout. The proposed research will contribute to the theoretical development and data collection exercises of this larger project NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Science (31)This project involves the running of a workshop whose goal is to establish a steering committee that will guide the development of internet-based resources to support a developing community of users and developers of algorithm and data structure visualizations (AVs). Successful use of AVs depends on both the availability of quality educational materials and their proper deployment. The field of AV has progressed little from the mid 1990s in terms of adoption levels or total educational impact. Many developers are not making use of lessons learned. Since effective ways of developing and deploying AVs are known, these difficulties can be overcome by a cohesive community of AV developers and users. The goal of this project is to build this community. The first step to building this community is to establish a steering committee of active members in the field who help to guide creation of an integrated collection of resources and infrastructure to serve as a communications hub and information clearing house. These resources leverage the progress already made by AV developers and users to bring about wider adoption and greater successful impact in the classroom.The intellectual merit is the improvement of the computer science education community's understanding of how AVs can be made pedagogically effective. The broader impact is improving on the general availability and quality of AVs, which can affect the educational outcomes for many students every year in computer science and related disciplines. Providing a community resource on best practices improves the development of future AVs. A clearing house of available AVs and documenting best practices for their use provides quality educational materials to instructors NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Eye tracking has become a widespread tool throughout the cognitive sciences and has attracted particular attention as a behavioral measurement tool for children with developmental disabilities. However, there are no standardized quantitative tools for assessing broadly defined attention skills in young children, and there is a lack of analysis techniques that would allow gaze patterns to be compared across individuals, across populations, or for a single individual across time.  This study will develop methods of quantitatively measuring attentional capacities by (1) designing a Visual Attention Assessment Suite (VAAS) which examines the interaction and impact of particular features of scenes on visual attention; (2) constructing novel computational analysis techniques for comparing gaze patterns across individuals, populations, and time; (3) validating these techniques against both standard behavioral assessment protocols and through an embodied modeling approach to ensure that our models capture the behaviorally important aspects of gaze.  The regulation of attention has been hypothesized as one of the fundamental factors affecting early development of children with autism.  This project will develop quantitative measures that can be used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and to evaluate the effectiveness of particular treatment approaches.  This project represents the first integrated and interdisciplinary attempt to develop a much needed full-scale diagnostic instrument that operates purely through eye-tracking, computational techniques, and individual modeling.   Although our primary focus is the interpretation of gaze data with respect to autism, eye tracking is used extensively in psychology, primatology, usability studies, marketing, and human-computer interaction experiments.  The models and analysis tools constructed under this project will be equally applicable to these other domains.  This project also has the potential to produce novel methods of assessing attentional abnormalities in other developmental disorders (e.g., mental retardation, attention deficit disorder, specific learning disabilities), novel educational assessment methods of pre-kindergarten readiness, as well as to develop training methods for teaching clinicians and educators behavioral assessment using a robot as a model illustrating various attentional patterns in children with disabilities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Engineering - Chemical (53)Current engineering education embraces computer-based visualizations and simulations to foster student learning. There is evidence that these technological advances, while improving student understanding of complex theories, have simultaneously led to a decrease in opportunities for students to explore forces, causal factors, and effects in the real world. The result is that diminished opportunity to physically experience produces a diminished ability to perceive among our undergraduate students. In this project, laboratory exercises are being developed to reconnect undergraduate chemical engineering students with the physical world. The new lab experiences emphasize somatic opportunities that promote physical insight and engineering judgment. These activities are designed to stimulate independent thought and creativity while promoting use of the human senses, tactile learning, tinkering, and data interpretation. The project's impact on student learning is being rigorously assessed through qualitative and quantitative measures. Project results are being broadly disseminated through presentations at conferences and through the development of a project web site NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A tree has been the organizing image to explain the relationships among living creatures since before Darwin's explanations for natural descent. The modern practice of comparing DNA and protein sequences to discern these relationships, however, has revealed complexities in the process of descent never before imagined. Organisms, particularly microbes, evolve by horizontal as well as vertical inheritance of traits with different groups of organisms exchanging genes, in addition to passing them down to the next generation. This research project addresses the question: Can the large scale structure of the tree/web of life be discerned? While the current data may be interpreted to mean that the depiction of life's history as a single bifurcating tree is incomplete, this should not be seen as justification to give up on reconstructing life's history. The working hypothesis underlying this research is that a reconstruction of life's early history is indeed possible, provided care is taken to guard against artifacts and that new, informative molecular characters are added to the analyses. Four complementary approaches will be used to address the question through analyses of microbial genome sequences. (1) Genome sequence data will be examined to find ancient horizontal gene transfer events that created useful taxonomic characters. An automated genome analysis pipeline will be developed to find these events, and these characters will be incorporated into new examinations of evolutionary relationships. (2) Complete genome sequences allow comparisons of all the genes of an organism with those of others to measure their evolutionary relatedness. However, the impact of horizontal acquisition of genes on these analyses is unknown. Computer simulations and genome sequences from two unrelated groups of microbes that have undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer, the Haloarchaea and the Thermotogales, will be used to gauge the extent to which different phylogenomic approaches are impacted by highways of gene sharing between different groups of organisms. (3) A public database will be constructed to store information on all putatively identified gene transfer events. This database will be a valuable resource for the wider scientific community to trace the role of gene transfer in the assembly of metabolic pathways and to examine the adaptation of organisms to new ecological niches. (4) The nature of the last common ancestor of all living creatures, the trunk of the tree of life, has been difficult to discern given all the changes in nucleotide composition that have occurred during evolutionary time. A compositional analysis will be used to detect the remaining signal of the genetic code's expansion that occurred early in life's history in order to  root  the tree of life. These in-depth analyses of several prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes will offer insights into the impacts of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution and phylogenetic reconstructions, as well as identify natural groups in the tree of life and help to resolve its deep structure. Unraveling the structure of the tree of life will have percussions in all fields of biology.This research program and its associated education activities will provide an ideal training ground in which high school, undergraduate, and graduate students along with postdoctoral fellows can learn about genome and organismal evolution. Plans are for three postdoctoral fellows, nine graduate students, and about twenty undergraduate and high school students to be trained through computational and laboratory research experiences. The goal is to train computer scientists and biologists to become experts in their respective disciplines and to become effective in trans-disciplinary communication; thereby enabling successful interdisciplinary collaborations. Results from the proposed research will be introduced into related courses on three campuses and will be accessible through an integrated database, which also includes a forum for public discussions on topics related to gene transfer and organismal evolution NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE RESEARCH ENABLING ROBOTIC AND HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION NASA''s mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration / scientific discovery / and aeronautics research. Within the next 20 years NASA will be laying the NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Channel bifurcations, wherein one channel splits into two, are the building blocks of braided, anastomosed, and distributary channel networks. Recent work has shown that the most common flow partitioning at bifurcations is asymmetric, and that this asymmetry seems to promote stability. Why and under what hydrographic and sedimentologic conditions this should be so, remain a puzzle. Here we propose an integrated field and theoretical investigation of the morphology, flow, and sedimentary processes of higher shear-stress, natural river bifurcations, with the objective of understanding and predicting their dynamical behavior. The field studies will be conducted to encompass two bifurcating systems with different sedimentation characteristics: i) distributary channel bifurcations of the Mossy Delta of the Saskatchewan River, where we have conducted pilot studies concerning bifurcation morphodynamics, and ii) bifurcations within the Wax Lake delta system, Louisiana, where active sedimentation is leading to rapid distributary channel growth. Several bifurcations at each site will be chosen to span a range of morphologic types. Bed morphology, water surface topography, flow velocity, and sediment transport rate will be measured at each bifurcation on a closely spaced grid at several flow stages. The field data will provide boundary and initial conditions for numerical experiments designed to define the processes and morphological conditions that lead to inherently unstable bifurcations, and detail the controlling boundary conditions for stability. Earlier numerical models will be improved by using Delft3D-FLOW, a morphodynamic model that accounts for: (1) three-dimensional turbulent unsteady, nonuniform flow, (2) interaction between bed topography, flow, and both bedload and suspended load, and (3) morphodynamically interacting erodible banks and bed. Numerical experiments will allow us to determine the feedback processes that promote stable bifurcations and predict which channel configurations are stable in the face of perturbations. We aim to yield a stability diagram for channel bifurcations and assess the influence of barform dynamics and downstream channel change in influencing bifurcation stability. A better understanding and predictive capability of channel bifurcation behavior would improve flood forecasting, planning and development of floodplain and channel structures, channel designs, and the success of stream restoration efforts. The results of this study also will advance our knowledge of when and where river avulsions will take. Insofar as it is transformative, it will resolve the differences among competing stability theories, and produce a model, constrained by the best-available field data, which can be used to predict the stability and behavior of these ubiquitous hydrologic and geomorphic nodes. Resulting from This Study: This work constitutes the dissertation topic and financial support for one Ph. D. candidate and will support one post-doctoral researcher. Two Native American high school students from the Cumberland House Cree Nation, Saskatchewan will be trained in its scientific methods. All students will benefit from exposure to a problem requiring the integration of geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamic modeling NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0736126 PI: BardeenThis award is for I2U2: Interactions in Understanding the Universe, an  educational virtual organization  (EDVO), which is designed to strengthen the education and outreach activities of scientific experiments at U.S. universities and laboratoriesby providing infrastructure support and a program framework for a portfolio of coherent, collaborative online science education laboratories. I2U2 maintains a growing online portfolio of educational laboratories for a diverse range of disciplines and provides tools and support services to assist developers in creating these educational resources. These laboratories break new ground by using the national Grid cyberinfrastructure for education in the same way that science increasingly uses the Grid.   I2U2 collaboratories take two similar but distinct shapes. ?e-Labs,? delivered as Web-based portals accessible in the classroom and at home, are implemented with the ever-expanding capabilities of Web-based media. ?i-Labs,? are delivered as interactive interfaces typically located within science museums and similar public venues.   I2U2 will deploy and maintain itself as a ?virtual organization? to provide support for participants across project boundaries and from many different home institutions who share a common interest in developing Grid-based education and outreach resources, and who seek to communicate, coordinate and reach their target audience through the Internet and the Grid.   I2U2 will also extensively evaluate and assess the effectiveness and use of the portfolio of science education laboratories NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Understanding how animals perceive and act upon complex natural environments is one of the most pressing challenges in neuroscience, with applications that have potential to revolutionize not only our understanding of the brain, but also machine vision, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Until now, studying the neural basis of active vision - how visual stimuli give rise to eye movements under diverse task conditions - has largely been restricted to simplified laboratory stimuli, presented to overtrained animals performing stereotypical tasks. With funding from the National Science Foundation, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Dr. Douglas Munoz at Queens University in Canada and Dr. Laurent Itti at the University of Southern California will combine neurophysiology and computational modeling to investigate free viewing in natural environments. Using multi-electrode arrays, this project will record in a deep brain structure, called the superior colliculus (SC). The SC is a layered structure comprising several well-understood neural maps, from purely sensory representations in the superficial layers, to sensorimotor representations linked to the control of eye movements in the deeper layers. The project will start by characterizing responses of neurons in the SC under simple stimulus conditions: When the animal is simply looking at a central fixation cross on a display while small isolated patterns are presented at other visual locations; when the animal searches for an oddball item among an array of distracting items; and when the animal inspects natural images and video clips. The  project will extend the investigators' salience map theories and models, and develop a new model of the SC. The complete model will predict, from any image or video clip, which visual locations are more salient, task-relevant, and candidate targets for eye movements.The project leverages a cross-disciplinary collaboration between a neurophysiology lab (co-PI Douglas P. Munoz) and a computational modeling lab (PI Laurent Itti). This will allow, through the combination of experiments and modeling, the interpretation of an otherwise undecipherable mass of data collected during natural viewing. Conversely, the theories will guide further experiments. Coupling multi-unit recording with modeling during free-viewing of natural videos has never been attempted before, and it is expected that it will lead to new understanding of how percepts map into actions under natural conditions. The project will support undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers, who will benefit from exposure to combined physiological and computational techniques, as will the investigators' teaching. In addition to publications, all theory and algorithm source code will be freely distributed, and data will be available through the CRCNS data sharing web site. This research is hence expected to lead to new and broadly accessible fundamental advances in the understanding of how animals use visual information to guide behavior, and how one could build machines which act in similar ways when faced with the complex natural world NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This study is intended to develop better understanding of why changes in reform-based practices in higher education are slow to develop.  The project aims to increase understanding of the relationship between mental models of faculty about effective pedagogy in STEM fields and the extent of consensus about such pedagogy. The research will also examine individual and institutional factors that may influence mental models and consensus and the individual and group level factors that are related to teaching practices and changes in cognitive structure and consensus over time. The study will use cognitive frameworks to explain institutional inertia and will develop methodological approaches to examine several different units of analysis using both cognitive and cultural frameworks.  The investigators will create an evaluation design that will be tested in higher education institutions.  It will describe the mental models held by individual faculty about effective pedagogy, describe the groups that have consensus on these structures, and describe how individuals and institutions vary in teaching approaches.   The study will measure changes in faculty views of pedagogical practices over time by following faculty over time.  Data will be gathered from faculty in math, life science and physical sciences over a three year period. The primary source of data will be a survey instrument given in the first and third year. There will also be in-dept interviews with subsets of faculty NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The study of earth's topography has fundamental impacts on society, from flood and landslide prevention and control to the understanding of climate change impacts, management of land-use practices, as well as design of roads and other man-made projects in an environmentally sustainable way.  The recent availability of high resolution (0.5 m spacing) digital topography from airborne laser swath mapping and ground-based lidar offers opportunities to develop a new class of environmental predictive models that explicitly incorporate important features of the landscape and thus enhance the accuracy of predictions. The goal of this project is to develop modern computational geometric image analysis methodologies applicable to hydrologic and eco-geomorphologic hazard prediction and control. Specifically, the project studies high-resolution, multiscale, and dynamic topography with the goal of extracting channel networks, channel banks and shapes, floodplains and hazard-relevant features such as landslide prone areas and service roads which contribute to increased sediment production and thus stream habitat deterioration.  The mathematical and computational techniques to be exploited and developed come from the area of geometric non-linear partial differential equations and energy formulations, combined with differential and computational geometry. Specifically, a combination of methodologies ranging from geometric scale-space theory to singularity theory and geometric variational principles, combined with optimal algorithms for computing special curves on surfaces, will be exploited to derive a complete and automatic analysis of the topography at multiple relevant scales NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is a  3-day-long workshop designed to explore the applications of high-resolution laser mapping to analyzing changes at the surface of the Earth.The objectives of this workshop are 1) to bring together scientists who are using high-resolution topographic datasets to develop and test intellectually significant ideas regarding Earth surface processes, and 2) to provide scientists with direct, hands-on opportunities to learn about newresearch advances and future directions of research in Earth surface processes. The workshop includes ~12 oral presentations which will be up to 1.5 hours in length. Each of these will be followed by relatively long discussion periods in which participants can ask questions about the data, the scientific goals, the results, and the techniques used to obtain theresults. All participants have the opportunity to present posters in one large room  for the entire duration of the workshop. Blocks of time will be devoted toviewing the posters, and we anticipate that this will provide many opportunities for students to interact with experienced investigators. The workshop participants will prepare a report thaht will be used as a basis for stimu;ating research in this area.The general themes of the workshop include the following topics:1. Geomorphic transport laws: current knowledge and future directions2. Landslides, landscapes, climate and land use3. Bedrock fracturing, topography, and landscape evolution4. The significance of topographic scaling5. Channels in three dimensions6. Tectonics, climate and topography7. Landuse legacies, river restoration and rivers revealed8. Glacial and periglacial landscapes 9. Coastal and tidal landscapes10. Forest and ecosystem dynamics11. The state of the art in Earth surface processes, and future directions of research.The outcomes of this workshop will have significant benefit for investigating major problems of value to society, such as river flooding, landslides, effects of agriculture and development on the landscape, and water resources issues NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal is part of a funded CRP from the EuroCORES HumVIB competition.]This project uses a new national survey with which to systematically measure American welfare attitudes in cross-national perspective. This research has two complementary goals. One is to field for the first time core items from the highly successful European Social Survey (ESS) to better enable comparisons between European nations and the United States. Cross-nationally standardized items are essential to survey measurement, and this project will build from the ESS data collection, extending measurement of welfare attitudes to the key case of the United States. The project's second thematic goal is to make use of an experimental design in which hypotheses about causal sources of welfare state attitudes can be adjudicated. Embedded survey experiments hold considerable promise in advancing scholarly understanding of attitude and preference formation. The dual focus of this project is on framing (in which the description of a social policy or its beneficiaries are varied) and sponsorship (in which the source of these descriptions are varied). Together, framing and sponsorship are essential elements of social and historical context that are typically held constant in opinion surveys. Building from the conventional social survey, the methodological benefit of survey experiments is to unpack these elements of context so that hypotheses about specific frames and competing sponsors can be evaluated. This project and data collection provides American and European scholars with a new survey with which to evaluate how and why social policy attitudes vary in the contemporary historical era. It provides for the principal investigator and larger European research team (of which this project is the United States component) the data with which to conduct survey based individual and multi-level analysis. Subsequent research projects are expected to offer novel explanations of why mass opinion on social welfare continues to differ across the worlds most developed nations. In fielding embedded survey experiments, this project offers new insights into mechanisms behind the formation of policy preferences. These experiments contribute to a firmer understanding of the United States in cross-national perspective. It is hoped that knowledge generated through these experiments may stimulate further applications of experimental surveys in cross-national research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The proposed workshop, to be held at the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery, aims to capitalize on a major new direction in research on formal models of human cognition, exploring probabilistic models of learning and cognitive development. The technical advances that have been made in the use of probabilistic models over the last twenty years in statistics, computer science, and machine learning have made this research enterprise possible, resulting in a set of mathematical and computational tools that can be used to build explicit models of psychological phenomena. By indicating the conclusions that a rational learner might draw from the data provided by experience, Bayesian models can be used to investigate how nature and nurture contribute to human knowledge. Although computational models have been used to aid empirical research on learning in the past, the lack of communication and collaboration between formal theorists and experimental laboratories has always been a stumbling block. This workshop will bring together two groups of researchers: experts in computational modeling and scientists studying cognitive development. The goal is both to report and to discuss the progress we have made so far with existing collaborative research and to foster future collaborations between computational scientists and learning researchers, leading to new insights and new models of how people learn and develop. A special emphasis will be placed on developing strategies of the application of these insights to educational research and practice NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ADAPTIVE CONTROL WITH A PRIORI GUARANTEED PERFORMANCE BOUNDS AND ROBUSTNESS/STABILITY MARGINS The objective of the proposed effort is to develop verifiable robust adaptive control architectures and relevant metrics for validating their stability / perform NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The University of Texas at Austin's Cockrell School of Engineering is partnering with the successful UTeach Natural Sciences program and the Austin Independent School District to develop and deliver UTeachEngineering, an innovative, design- and challenge-based curriculum for preparing secondary teachers of engineering.  To meet the growing need for engineering teachers in Texas, and to serve as a model in engineering education across the nation, UTeachEngineering has the following four professional development pathways to teacher preparedness, two for in-service teachers and two for pre-service teachers:     1.  UTeach Master of Arts in Science and Engineering Education (MASEE);     2.  Engineering Summer Institutes for Teachers (ESIT);     3.  Engineering Certification Track for Physics Majors; and     4.  Teacher Preparation Track for Engineering Majors. Key elements of the four UTeachEngineering pathways are four new engineering courses focusing on engineering content and pedagogy: Fundamentals in Engineering and Design, Knowing and Learning in Engineering, Engineering Energy Systems, and Design of Machines and Systems.  Leveraging these four courses in combination with existing UTeach pedagogical courses, UTeachEngineering anticipates reaching 650 teachers (80 pre-service and 570 in-service) over the first five years.  In the future, it is expected that UTeachEngineering will be sustained as a vital program at the University of Texas at Austin.UTeachEngineering is firmly rooted in current research in the field of engineering education and affords a much-needed opportunity to study the teaching and learning of engineering.  During the development phase, UTeachEngineering is examining impacts on three specific groups: (1) Engineers involved in the creation of curricular materials and course design, (2) participants (current and future teachers) enrolled in the engineering courses, and (3) the students of these teachers.  While the focused goal of UTeachEngineering is to train a cadre of secondary teachers, the project's vision is that all students are  engineering enabled,  acquiring the design and interaction skills that would enable them to be successful in an engineering career should they choose one, while enhancing their lives and participation as global citizens even if they do not become engineers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Iron and Copper serve as key co-constituents for numerous enzymes in a wide range of biological systems, and their elevated or impoverished levels in aqueous systems have dramatic consequences at organismal, ecosystem, and human health scales. Over the last decade these effects have increasingly been recognized to be important in ocean systems. Identifying sites and times where these metals cause negative environmental outcomes is greatly hampered by their comparatively sparse datasets. This problem is a direct consequence of the analytical challenge of obtaining accurate Fe and Cu determinations in saline waters at very low (trace) concentrations, and the limitations of ship-dependent sampling regimes. The PI's request funding to build on research and technology advances in the Tripp, Wells and King laboratories to develop active nanostructures that can serve as platforms amenable for detection of a wide range of environmentally important dissolved metals in seawater. Preliminary work has validated a biologically-inspired sensor platform in the subarctic N. Pacific, providing the first demonstration of dissolved Fe measurements at very low (Broader Impacts:This project has the potential to further develop a sensor that will provide unique information about the chemical speciation of the biologically important metals Fe and Cu. The work proposed here fills an important need for high spatial and temporal resolution data of these metals identified as priority by researchers in marine chemistry and marine biogeochemistry. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to fill an analytical void for data that continues to stymie efforts to understand how and Cu and more specifically Fe availability in the oceans modulates the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the marine environment. The proposal is well balanced in its goal of marrying nanotechnology with IR spectroscopy to address a analytical void while providing specific support for the training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PIs plan to develop minority student involvement in their research. This will have the most important impact, since bringing smart students into our field and stimulating young students to consider careers in science is essential for the continued growth of our national science capabilities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The College Ready in Mathematics and Physics Partnership (College Ready) is comprised of thirty-three school districts in Arkansas and Oklahoma, the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, and the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, which will serve as the lead among these core partners.  In addition, the following are supporting partners: the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), American Physical Society (APS), College Board, Mathematical Association of America (MAA), Maplesoft, Northwest Arkansas Community College (NWACC), and the UAF Center for Mathematics and Science Education (CMASE).  College Ready intends to build vertical and horizontal learning communities among school and college faculty in order to improve major articulation issues that impact the successful transition of students from high school to college.  College Ready focuses its work on a number of critical junctures and therefore is centered on articulation issues between school and college - teacher preparation in college for work in schools and student preparation in school for college mathematics and science - and among colleges and disciplines.The major intents of College Ready are to:1)  Prepare students for college success, especially in STEM Areas    a.  Smooth the transition to college by improved articulation    b.  Provide improved placement mechanisms for college mathematics2)  Enhance teacher capacity to deliver rigorous, successful courses and      curricula    a.  Build learning communities of school and college faculty    b.  Sort out and negotiate competing standards and accountabilities3)  Build vertical and horizontal learning communities to improve articulation 4)  Prepare teachers to serve as curriculum and pedagogy leaders who can    a.  serve as peer mentors to fellow teachers    b.  encourage pedagogy that is correctly connected to content, and     c.  create synergism between mathematics and science classes 5)  Make effective learning resources available, including the production of    supporting materials for ongoing professional development and embedded     English Language Learner (ELL) instruction 6)  Strengthen pre-service education7)  Improve the number of pre- and postsecondary teachers, including     recruitment and retention.Ultimately, College Ready will demonstrate an impact on student outcomes through decreases in college remediation rates in mathematics, increases in student proficiency scores on state assessments, increased numbers of students enrolling in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics and physics courses and scoring 3 or better on the AP exams, and increased graduation and college-going rates.College Ready will achieve these ends through a series of interconnected activities including vertical alignment of high school and college expectations, intensive content driven workshops, articulation conferences, university course revisions, the creation of professional learning communities, and the opportunity to earn advanced degrees and endorsements.  It builds on and looks to establish synergy between established efforts of PhysTEC and PMET. The College Ready endeavors are complemented by a set of three research questions to be pursued:  Is there a unifying construct in the way units are used in physics, economics, public discourse, and in 9-14 mathematics? What measures best determine college readiness and placement in mathematics, and how can placement testing in mathematics be better aligned with high school curricula? What educational opportunities influence students to choose a career in secondary physics teaching, and which elements are replicable NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a SGER proposal to complement the PI's NSF-funded International Research Experiences (NSF-IRES) program in the East African region. The overarching aim of the proposed research is investigating adaptations that can be made to existing earth bricks to improve their hygrothermal performance in hot and humid climates such as Dar es Salaam. This will be achieved through a series of laboratory testing complemented with advanced computer modeling. The specific research objectives focus on assessing how wall made out of earth bricks can be engineered for optimal performance with respect to: 1) Water vapor permeability; 2) Hygroscopicity, and; 3) Capillarity. The findings will be used to develop a computer-based model for predicting the performance of earth bricks.It is now universally acknowledged that organic building materials such as earth bricks are more sustainable. However, there are still doubts with respect to their adequacy as far as mechanical properties are concerned. The proposed SGER research will contribute to credibility of the properties of the existing earth bricks. A key outcome of the proposed SGER research will be a hygrothermal material property database for earth bricks which will be published on the Web. The research will also bring together a team of foreign experts who are currently working in silos. The PI will provide research training for a female, graduate student through the SGER NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether an interpretation for the transport behavior of electrons in bismuth (Bi) nanowires when subjected to high magnetic fields is also valid for the recently observed behavior exhibited by charge carriers in bulk single crystal Bi.  The observed effects in bulk Bi have been interpreted as being due to the electrons in bulk Bi behaving like electrons constrained to moving only in a thin layer (i.e., exhibiting the fractional charge of a collective quantum state of 2 dimensional electrons).  The transport behavior in Bi nanowires has been interpreted as arising from electrons near the surface of the wire (i.e., the surface states).  However, there are similarities between the magnetic field dependent transport measurements of Bi nanowires and bulk Bi.  Low temperature electronic transport measurements in magnetic fields on bulk Bi will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal the possible contributions from surface states and fractional charge.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies.  ****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****This Small Grant for Exploratory Research enhances research opportunities for minority students at a Historically Black University.  It will allow them to contribute to the discovery process, including experimental research and the exchange of ideas at the frontier of science.  The project will attempt to elucidate whether surface states could explain the recently observed magneto-transport behavior in bulk Bi.  Recent experimental studies of the Nernst effect and Hall effect of bulk Bi in the quantum limit (magnetic fields larger than 9 Tesla) have been interpreted in terms of charge fractionalization, an unusual collective quantum state seen only in two-dimensional electron gases.  Absorption peaks with the same Shubnikov-deHaas period of 0.03/T have been observed in the magnetoresistance and thermopower of Bi nanowires both below and above the quantum limit of 9 T.  In this case an interpretation in terms of surface states related to a spin-orbit surface interaction was proposed. Measurements of the magnetoresistance and Hall effect of thin samples of bulk single-crystal bismuth in magnetic fields up to 45 T will be performed.  These measurements are designed to reveal possible contributions by surface states and fractional charge, allow evaluation of their properties such as effective masses, and permit evaluation of the relative importance of surface effects and electronic transport by bulk-like electrons and holes in bulk Bi.  This timely project could be transformative in our understanding of Bi in the quantum limit and lead to future technologies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER People's perceptual judgments and actions depend on the pick-up of informative energy patterns arriving at the senses. As examples, a driver's detection of certain optical variables informs the decision of whether it is safe to pass another car; another variable might inform the driver whether the current braking action will stop the car in time, or if force on the brake needs to be increased. One key function of perceptual and perceptual-motor learning is to change the variables that the perceiver-actor attends to in making their judgments or in controlling their actions. Perceiver-actors educate their attention to variables that permit more accurate judgments and more effective motor activities. A central question, however, is how perceivers improve. While experience can make clear that judgments and actions are not accurate and that change is needed, until recently it has been unclear how (or if) experience actually directs the improvement. A new theory, called direct learning, lays out how change is guided by information. The current project explores: How should one arrange a perceptual learning situation so that learning proceeds as quickly and accurately as possible? Can perceptual learning be shown to be indifferent to the probabilistic value of sensory information? Does learning to detect some information entail exploratory movements that create it? If so, can goal-directed movement also be aimed at information-production? The findings could have broad practical applications to attempts to train perceiver-actors to discriminate objects (letters, faces, aircraft), events (deceptive intention, impending collisions), and to control movements (aircraft landing, skilled athletic or dance performance NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0827201ZumbergeThis proposal seeks funding to develop a down-hole vertical strain sensor using an optical fiber approach. The proposed sensor will increase robustness by deploying only optical components down-bore ? keeping electronic components at the sediment-water or above-ground level. Additionally, the fiber will be deployed outside the borehole casing. The strainmeter will be deployed at the Piñon Flat Observatory (PFO) to compare data with existing strain-measuring instrument packages. A goal of this development is to extend the useful measurement frequency range. Strain is an integral part of understanding fundamental tectonic processes in the surface crust. An existing borehole at PFO will be used and data will be compared and validated against horizontal strain volume from existing sensors. The interferometric processing system has already been developed. Two main intellectual goals are sought: 1) to improve and evaluate the prototype instrument design and performance, and 2) to thoroughly test the assumption vertical strain can be related to horizontal strain through existing models. The management plan has the PIs and two other PI-level personnel receiving 0.5 month per year salary support. Two development techs and a graduate student will receive 3 month per year salary and tuition/fee support. A research project assistant will receive one month per year salary support. The remaining funds support supply and instrumentation acquisition and general logistical costs. The project will support a graduate student and results will directly impact the field of geodesy and has societal relevance in natural hazard monitoring NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D. This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty. The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0332103   Aultman-Hall   The overall goal of this research is to characterize the relationships between spatial transportation-related variables (e.g., road type, grade, traffic conditions, land-use patterns), vehicle operating conditions (speed, acceleration, load) and mobile source fine particulate matter (PM) emissions. The project has three objectives. First, we will develop operating mode-based PM emissions models for light-duty vehicles based on real-world tailpipe emissions data. Second, vehicle operating mode and PM emissions will be modeled spatially as a function of transportation network variables and the surrounding land use environment. Finally, transient operating events will be studied to determine the associated PM emissions and their spatial distribution NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SciGirls, produced by Twin Cities Public Television, is a new PBS 13-part half-hour television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to girls ages 8 - 13-year olds.  The intended impacts are to 1) to foster a greater interest in STEM among girls ages 8 to 13 and their parents, with girls from diverse communities the highest priority; 2) connect girls to existing, quality STEM education opportunities in their communities; and 3) contribute to the growing body of research to deepen understanding of the most effective ways to engage girls in STEM activities and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.  The project?s two strategic partners are the National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) in Seattle, and The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.  The NGCP will link SciGirls TV with its network of 500 community-based science programs for girls, and The Franklin Institute will help form an affiliate network of science museums to implement SciGirls TV outreach activities.  In addition to the broadcasts on PBS Plus, the videos will be distributed via online streaming and DVD?s, as well as via versions that can be downloaded to portable video players.  The most significant web component will be a social networking feature that will allow girls interested in science to connect with others across the nation.  Barbara Flagg of Multimedia Research will conduct formative evaluation of the first rough cuts, and a subsequent summative evaluation of the completed programs and of the social networking web site NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THERMAL EMISSION ANALYSIS OF EXTINCT COMET CANDIDATES AND M-TYPE ASTEROIDS We propose thermal and compositional analysis of thermal emission spectra (5.2 / 38 microns) of two groups of small bodies: Extinct comet candidates and M-type asteroids. Together NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A compelling issue that emerged from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report,  AR4, in 2007 was the interest in  short term  climate projections out to about 2030.  This is a time frame of interest for many decision support activities and impacts, but is not explicitly addressed with current models and experiments.  Any short-term climate information currently provided is simply taken from relatively coarse grid global coupled climate models in the early stages of 21st century simulations that began in the late 1800s and are run to 2100 and beyond.  While this provides some information regarding the response of the climate system to external forcing on near-term time scales, it has recently been recognized that a different type of experiment using models with higher spatial resolution and possibly an observed initial state could provide better regional climate change information for decision support and other applications over the next few decades. An Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) session in the summer of 2006 first proposed an experimental design for the next round of coordinated climate change experiments that explicitly included short-term climate predictions to be performed for assessment by the international climate modeling community. Since then this has been taken up by World Climate Research program (WCRP), International Geosphere/Biosphere Program (IGBP) and the IPCC, with the WCRP's Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) targeting decadal prediction as the next big research challenge for the climate modeling community. The AGCI session in 2008 takes up where the 2006 session left off, and carries this concept to the next level by tackling not only the formidable science issues involved with designing and running short term climate projections (now more commonly referred to as  decadal prediction ).  The session also addresses the important issues of the utility and application of this information for decision support and impacts research.  The organizers invited U.S. and international experts from modeling groups doing research in decadal prediction, as well as representatives from the decision support and impacts communities who would use this information.  Output from this session will be a white paper summarizing the current state of knowledge on decadal prediction, the degree of success one could expect from such experiments, possible solutions to the scientific challenges involved with this problem, and an assessment of how this type of climate change information could be used for decision support and impacts analyses the next few decades. Broader impacts include, primarily, the large value of decadal prediction for societal adaptation planning for near term (on generational time scales) climate change NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Morgan State University and Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) are core partners for the MSP-Start  BRAIN-STEM  project which is building the necessary institutional infrastructure, in both the university and the school system, to implement activities that integrate mathematical and biological concepts in a manner that can be incorporated into high school mathematics and science courses.  From a content perspective, they are focusing on discrete mathematics and genomics as material that is interesting, engaging, and at an appropriate level for success.  They are conducting a needs analysis in the BCPSS by collecting and analyzing student achievement and teacher characteristic data in grades 9 - 12 math and science.  They are using these results in designing a project that addresses the content and pedagogical needs of Baltimore City Public School System (BCSS) life sciences and mathematics teachers through the use of integrated problem-based learning that incorporates standards-based mathematics instruction and inquiry-based science instruction.  Furthermore, they are using their evaluation outcomes as the basis for developing a full MSP Targeted Partnership proposal.Morgan State University is a public, coeducational university which primarily serves students from underrepresented minority backgrounds.  Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) serves over 87,000 students in urban and non-urban settings in Baltimore, Maryland, including 37 different high schools.  About 75% of the school age children in the Baltimore City Public School district are African American NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Much of the literature on technological innovation focuses on analyzing measures of the scientific, technical, or commercial productivity of specific types of innovation-related activities in isolation, and does not consider the overall productivity of the linked sequences of these activities that constitute an innovation chain, from scientific discovery through commercialization. There currently is a gap in understanding of how different types of individual innovative activities come to be linked sequentially in a chain of events that ultimately may produce new commercial products or processes. Similarly, little is known about the organizational and institutional determinants of the overall productivity of linked sequences of such innovative events over time and space. This project analyzes the economic, organizational, and institutional determinants of the probability of a successful transition between such innovative events, and ultimately, toward commercially successful innovation, at each stage along the innovation chain. Data gleaned from patents, scientific publications, literature and patent citations, licensing agreements, research funding, and collaborative agreements are being used to construct a novel database of spatial and temporal linkages between activities and entities at each stage along an innovation chain, and to develop qualitative and quantitative indicators of knowledge and technology flows within these chains of linked events. The database is being constructed using case studies of nano-electronic innovations in the semiconductor industry, and applications of biotechnology innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. This research focus is inspired by efforts within these two mature high technology industries to experiment with novel strategies to integrate emerging technologies into their innovation pipelines. The variety and breadth of organizational, institutional, and funding strategies used to coordinate innovative activities in these industries provides a rich and varied set of data to be used in developing indicators and understanding of knowledge and technology flows. Broader Impacts: Although this research focuses on the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, the analysis should also have a broader impact in the development of more generally applicable stylized facts about determinants of the innovative process. The indicators of knowledge and technology flows being constructed are available for use as data in estimation of econometric models of determinants of the probability of a given R&D project successfully transitioning to various possible types of successor projects along an innovation chain, and ultimately, resulting in commercialization. Analysis of this database using a structural model provides empirical insights into the economic, organizational and structural factors that maximize the probability of success for innovation-related projects. These insights are a significant contribution to the development of a science of science and innovation policy. Further, decision makers in both the public and private sectors should be able to use these results to help choose among different possible organizational, institutional, and funding strategies, and improve the odds of successful innovation resulting from supported projects NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Objective: The objective of this SGER proposal is to investigate extraordinary transmission effect in plasmonic crystals to develop fundamentally new detection platforms for quantitative, specific and high throughput detection of biomolecules. Intellectual Merit: Extraordinary transmission effect has been suggested for various applications ranging from sensing, to near-field optics and optoelectronics. But, its underlying physical mechanism is still not clear. In this proposal the PI will investigate the origin of the effect and focus on engineering new plasmonic crystal structures that can support both propagating and localized plasmons. In particular, the shape effect of the nano-apertures will be investigated both numerically and experimentally for strong field enhancement and large plasmon resonance shift. The structures will be tested by using various model biomolecules with different sizes to determine the metric of sensors. Surface chemistry will also be optimized for structured gold surfaces. Broader Impacts:  The broad goal of this proposal is to integrate plasmonics and nanophotonics concepts for realization of new generation of biosensors. The PI will put strong effort to integrate research and education by feeding new research results back into the courses that PI is currently developing, trying to attract underrepresented minority students, and by working with outreach programs to help young students start a career in science and technology,.  In particular, the PI will continue to organize hand-on activities for existing outreach programs of Boston University such as Upward Bound Math and Science and Summer Pathways that are targeting minority high school students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Engineering (32)This project involves the running of the Information Assurance Capacity Building Program (IACBP), intended to improve the capacity of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), including both Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HCBUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), to offer high quality Information Assurance (IA) education and a specialization in Computer Forensics Science. The IACBP aids MSIs to develop IA curricula under advisement and with academic enrichment from established leaders in the field, leading to the implementation of new IA activities at the MSIs. The objectives are to build new capacity or expand existing capacity to offer IA courses and programs at MSIs not currently designated as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in IA Education; to expand the research opportunities in IA; and to help build expertise in Cyber Forensics Science. As a two-year workshop, the program gives a two-week session during the first year that presents IA theory and practice, and then gives a three-day follow-up session during the second year where participants present their initial outcomes and results to their peers. This method integrates three main components: technological knowledge, pedagogical support and an individual curriculum development plan NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The research objective of the project is the design of a photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected system for remote rural health clinics in Egypt. The work encompasses data collection of load and weather parameters, selection and comparison of PV grid-connected system configurations, modeling and simulation of PV-grid-connected operation, design of power management system, economic assessment of the proposed system and specification of the proposed system.This project is being supported by the U.S.-Egypt Joint Board For Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration.  Intellectual Merit:The project represents a natural continuation of the scientific cooperation between the Electronics Research Institute and the University of Nevada in the new research area of photovoltaic (PV) energy as an alternative and clean energy source. The project will focus on a detailed study of PV-grid connected energy system configuration, components, mode of operation and control, and costs. The second main objective of the project is to study the utilization of PV grid-connected energy systems to supply remote rural emergency health clinics in Egypt with electrical energy. This includes assessing the required size of the PV system. Broader Impacts:The project's objectives are to develop new approaches to energy systems that will provide reliable service to remote hospitals in Egypt where grid power is currently unreliable. Moreover, the approach to PV grid-connected energy systems will encourage government and private investment in PV energy in Egypt. This will provide currently underserved areas with access to reliable clean energy while saving fossil fuels and protecting the environment from harmful emissions. In addition, some of the developed solutions will benefit states with remote sparsely populated areas, like Nevada. As part of the effort young Egyptian scientists will be trained in the use of sophisticated software for power system analysis that is not available in their institutions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Concow-Maidu Indians of northern California now live primarily on the Berry Creek, Enterprise, Mooretown rancherias, and neighboring communities. With support from the National Science Foundation, Julie McIntosh (Mooretown Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California) and her team will document the nearly extinct Northwestern Maidu language (also called Konkow or Concow Maidu).  It is now believed to have no more than four fluent speakers, and thus the urgency of the documentation effort is great. Although other Maiduan languages, particularly Northeastern (Mountain) Maidu, have received scholarly attention, Northwestern Maidu has so far been the subject of only limited study, and virtually none within the past forty years. The project will make video and audio recording of the speech of the remaining speakers; transcribe selected recordings; create a lexical database from both earlier sources and current speakers, and create an inventory of all extant written and electronic materials relating to the language. All language documentation materials will be prepared in a variety of paper, analog, and digital formats to make them maximally available both to the local indigenous communities and to researchers. With the silencing of hundreds of languages in the past decades, it has never been clearer that every human language represents a unique intellectual achievement, and that the loss of any language is a loss of knowledge that has repercussions far beyond the local community. The documentation of the Concow Maidu language will set the foundation for integrated research activities for the Maidu community, as well as for linguists. These first steps in documentation will prepare the way for the creation of a variety of resources to be used in language revitalization, both pedagogical materials and a grammar NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THE ROLE OF WATER IN THE EARLY FORMATION OF MARS: WET MAGMA OCEAN CRYSTALIZATION / THE GROWTH OF A WATER ATMOSPHERE / AND RETENTION OF WATER IN THE MANTLE Introduction: On Mars crater densities indicate that crust in both hemispheres dates from the early NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER LIGHT RUNNERS STEREO SPACE MISSION E/PO  Light Runners  is a touring E/PO program that provides unprecedented access to STEREO space mission imagery data to the blind and visually handicapped as well as sighted populations across the country. The program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Introduction: This proposal is prepared in response to the devastating floods in Eastern Iowa and nearlythe entire Upper Mississippi River (UMR) basin during May-July 2008. In UMR Pool 16, above Lock andDam 16 at Muscatine, Iowa, waters abruptly rose from a highly managed stage of approximately 10 feetto 20 feet and then to nearly 24 feet from May-June 2008. This historic flood event coincided withintense spring cultivation and nutrient application activities in the heavily farmed landscape of theUpper Midwest resulting in a significant pulse of agricultural contaminants to the UMR system. This hasled scientists to predict an almost unprecedented delivery of sediment and nutrients to Pool 16, thebroader Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.This event presents a unique, and short-lived, opportunity to test scientific hypotheses related to ahighly perturbed, large river ecosystem. This ecosystem of braided channels and natural backwaters isalready known to inadequately process nutrients such as nitrate to the degree required to protect theGulf from hypoxic episodes. Extreme, flood-related sediment deposition almost certainly impacts thenutrient processing cycle in the short and long term. It is also known that mussels and bacteria play amajor role in nutrient cycling in the broad food web containing phytoplankton, zooplankton, microzooplankton,dissolved & particulate organic matter, and benthos. Given this confluence of events, andthe importance of understanding nutrient cycling, we wish to test the following hypothesis:Intense deposition of particulate organic matter from extreme flooding alters the freshwater mussel andmicrobial food webs through physical and chemical means.Immediate Need: The principal investigators feel this hypothesis can only be tested via the quickresponseSmall Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) funding mechanism since the highly perturbedecosystem in question is actively returning to more steady-state conditions. The research team must bedeployed very soon to study the perturbed nitrogen cycling rates such that comparisons with baselinenitrogen processing rates can be made in the future.Broader Impacts: Floods occur around the world on a regular basis, but the frequency and extremity ofthese events will increase given the influence of global climate change. This research will contribute tothe development of a ?theory of floods? that is proposed by colleagues at the University of Iowa. Thistheory will seek to unify research related to hydrology, ecology, socio-economic, environmental andhuman consequences and influences on flooding. The impact of such research can be expressed inbillions of dollars, millions of acres of habitat, thousands of species, and centuries of human enjoyment.Intellectual Merit: This research will expand our knowledge of large river nutrient processing dynamicsresulting from extreme flooding events and during baseline moments. Abrupt changes in nutrientloading and extreme shifts in algal compositions can influence food quality which may adversely affectdesirable and invasive freshwater mussels. This work will further characterize the relation betweennutrient conditions and food quality for mussels and other biota in an important reach of the UpperMississippi River. Water quality, nutrients, and their effects of biological processes are key managementconcerns in the Upper Mississippi River NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The proposal seeks NSF support to bring together scientists, engineers, resource managers and policy makers across NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions in a workshop format. The objectives for the workshop include (i) sharing information among NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions on the nature of water resources issues (management, policy) and the state-of-the-art in research (science) on water in the NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions, (ii) exploration of collaboration and outreach strategies for researchers, managers and policy makers, and (iii) identification of opportunities across NSF directorates for research support in water dynamics that will align with the expertise of scientists and engineers in NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions in order to improve funding competitiveness. Workshop speakers will highlight and share ideas on emerging scientific innovations in water dynamics. These talks and poster presentations will profile new studies that focus on examining the dynamics of change in water systems and new research tools available to scientists and engineers to document and model these changes. The workshop is specifically designed to build collaborations among NSF EPSCoR researchers, thereby strengthening the nation?s research capacity.Workshop participants will address the relevance of research to water resource management and policy. Speakers will highlight the opportunities for STEM educational outreach and workforce development through community based research. The social dynamics of the hydrological systems will be explored, as will strategies for bringing the diversity of water researchers and students in line with national demographics, engaging all jurisdictions and special populations in our national research mission NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Health care delivery in the U.S. is experiencing severe and worsening problems.  Costs are higher than in other countries and continue to increase, yet the overall quality of care delivered is not improving.  Increasing demand for health care as baby boomers become elderly is further straining the care delivery system.  Thus, dramatic changes are needed in health care delivery in the U.S. over the next decade.  One proposed solution is computer systems designed for health care, called health information technology (HIT).  These HIT systems, particularly electronic health records (EHR) that store patients? medical history and their interactions with physicians, promise significant improve¬ments in quality, effectiveness and productivity of care delivery.  Yet simply installing HIT without significantly changing existing work processes is unlikely to produce needed results. What is needed is an in-depth under¬standing of how HIT and process design techniques should be conceptualized and applied in health care. This project develops theories that can transform health care delivery processes in the U.S., through a deep understanding of the changes needed to make effective use of HIT and process design techniques.  The questions we address are: What capabilities does an EHR provide and which are used by health care organizations?  Which characteristics of the health care context, including characteristics of countries, the physician and nursing professions, and health care organizations, enable and inhibit the ability of health care organizations to take advantage of what EHR systems provide?  What are the dynamics of change by which EHR capabilities affect care delivery processes?  How and why do new EHR systems improve or reduce the quality and productivity of health care delivery processes?  How do health care organizations and individuals working in them need to change to make the most effective use of new EHR systems?  Answers to these questions will provide the knowledge needed to transform health care delivery processes in the U.S.This team will conduct multiple case studies of EHR implementation in health care organizations to understand the dynamics of change as the EHR implementation alters health care delivery processes.  The case studies will be carried out at our partner organizations, Fallon Clinic, UMass Memorial Health Care, Canada?s single payer system in British Columbia, and two of Israel?s four Health Fund systems.  These four settings provide different health care contexts, enabling us to observe and learn from their differences.  Improving the quality of health care delivered in the U.S. as well as reducing its cost has become a critically important societal goal.  The health care system is reaching a breaking point, and needs to be changed.  Simplistic solutions, however, will not work. Solutions require an interdisciplinary approach and the holistic, in-depth understanding of the variety of forces influencing change that will be studied in this project.  The work produced will provide a foundation for a larger community of researchers transforming HIT and process design ideas to solve health care delivery problems NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Science (31)Scholarships for both undergraduate and graduate students are being given by this institution to students seeking degrees in a broad-based Information Assurance (IA) program with a special focus on computer forensics.  The institution's IA program offers a blend of education, research, experiential learning, and professional development.  The computer forensics program focus benefits from a close association with a nearby Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory.  Each scholarship recipient completing this IA degree program serves for two years as an IA professional in a Federal government agency NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement award seeks to improve observational modeling and analysis of high elevation hydroclimatology by strengthening the instrumentation and modeling infrastructure. A second goal is to address a critical state problem with global significance ? understanding and forecasting the effects of climate change on water supply and water quality in arid regions. Climate changes are affecting natural environments around the world. In New Mexico, climate changes are altering processes associated with water supply, which sustains New Mexico?s economy and determines, to a large extent, the quality of life. This multidisciplinary effort will transform climate change science and policymaking in New Mexico by providing the tools required for quantitative, science-driven discussion of difficult water policy options facing the state, and will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources.Project Major Foci: The research will address the influence of large scale atmospheric circulations on regional and local atmospheric processes and explore how hydrometeorological fluctuations propagate into changes in surface flows downstream.Given the uncertainties associated with global coupled model projections across southwestern North America, the research will examine the covariability of precipitation and land anomalies in these projections as they relate to the Southwest. Land-atmosphere feedbacks associated with snowpack at high elevation may be of first-order importance in modulating the transition from winter to summer precipitation in the current climate. Thus, characterizing and properly simulating the full seasonal hydrological cycle in regions with winter snowpack is critical for process-based analysis and for projections of stream flows in New Mexico, motivating the proposal?s focus on the upstream portion of the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico.Intellectual MeritThe impacts of climate change on New Mexico are profound and are altering processes associated with the water supply for the region. Proposed research infrastructure improvements will enable scientists to observe processes at the watershed scale and to understand the effects of climate change on water supply, water sources, and water quality in arid regions. New Mexico EPSCoR proposes to strategically invest in building a robust hydrologic infrastructure to develop a better understanding of the relationship of high elevation events to downstream water supplies. This capability is needed for meaningful forecasting and decision support. New cyberinfrastructure will support multi-scale modeling and rapid delivery of climate change data and information to scientists, educators, decision-makers, and the public.Broader ImpactsNew Mexico EPSCoR research foci are of global scientific and societal importance. The investment in research, cyberinfrastructure and human infrastructure will establish New Mexico as a laboratory for climate change and a model for science-based public policy that can serve science and society. Education, outreach and diversity programs will create a citizenry that is informed about climate change and its impact on natural resources NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Many neurons in the auditory system respond to sounds nonlinearly; that is, its response to two sounds played simultaneously differs from the sum of its responses to each sound played alone. Nonlinearities are necessary for many computational functions, but unlike nonlinear models that allow closed-form solutions, nonlinear models are often too hard to characterize in practice. To make nonlinear models tractable, this project will combine single-unit recording in awake marmoset monkey with automated online stimulus design by parallel computing. The goal of this stimulus design is not to maximize the firing rate of a neuron, but to extract the most information about the global stimulus-response relationship.  Optimal sounds will be designed  on the fly  according to a neuron's response history, with the help of a fast parallel computer whose running time is compatible with the single-unit recording experiment. The proposed research is expected to produce practical and widely applicable methods for characterizing nonlinear sensory neurons. The auditory system is an ideal system for this type of online experiment because sound space is of lower dimensions and allows faster computations. The methods developed here are expected to generalize to nonlinear problems in other sensory modalities.Theory and algorithm development will focus on generating sound stimuli which can either most accurately estimate a given model, or maximally distinguish competing models. Nonlinear models with various degrees of complexity, including neural network models, will be used simultaneously, and contrasted against one another in the automated experiment. The model-based sound design method will be used to characterize complex response properties of neurons in auditory cortex and inferior colliculus of awake marmoset monkey, a vocal primate. This project focuses on the auditory cortex because studies of its pronounced nonlinearities may potentially benefit most from the new method. For comparison the same method will also be applied to the inferior colliculus, the inputs to which are better known, allowing more realistic hierarchical models to be developed. The models obtained from this method should provide a concise summary of the global stimulus-response relationship of a neuron that generalizes across all types of stimuli. Neural network models may also help extract additional information about the connectivity between different neuronal types, thus providing a link between the stimulus-response function and the structure of the underlying neural circuits NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER On an ordinary day, people perform actions that affect other people's behavior resulting in outcomes that affect both.  Such social interactions are dynamic, far ranging, and usually require an exchange of information between the parties involved. A simple example is two persons modifying their approach to an elevator to accommodate each other's passage through the narrow space. More complex situations involve a teacher providing guidance to a pupil based on the pupil's own actions or training foreign military personnel to accomplish some function that depends on the latter's previous experiences. How are such social interactions to be quantified and understood? What goes on in a person's brain when they interact with another and what principles and mechanisms govern the coordination between brains?  The investigators of this project constitute an interdisciplinary team whose expertise spans physics, cognitive science and neuroscience. They use the concepts, methods and tools of coordination dynamics, the science of coordination, to investigate both the behavioral and neural underpinnings of social behavioral interactions. The basic experimental paradigm involves coordination of movements between two people or between an individual and a computer avatar endowed with human-like capabilities. Pairs of people perform simple actions in front of each other and the investigators monitor key behavioral and neural variables that reveal how strongly each affects the other. By testing specific predictions of a mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, the investigators aim to understand how social coordination evolves in time and to determine the respective strength of one person's influence on another. Modern technology is always seeking to enhance human experience and productivity. The notion of 'others' has been expanded to include not only real human beings but also cyber-individuals, as evident in the increasing roles played by robotics and virtual environments in everyday human transactions.  In crucial experiments, a human subject interacts with a virtual partner, an avatar driven by the investigators' mathematical model of coupled dynamical systems, thereby allowing the investigators to manipulate parameters (the 'personality' or 'attitude' of the virtual partner) that are not normally accessible in studies of live interactions. Thus the present project may not only uncover rules of ordinary social coordination but also offer a principled approach to human-machine interaction. In addition, the project will disseminate knowledge about complex systems and dynamical approaches to human social behavior. The investigators will train undergraduate and graduate students in advanced methods and analysis techniques that cut across the behavioral and social sciences, the physics and mathematics of coupled dynamical systems, and neuroscience and brain imaging. The development of new measuring instruments that may apply to any arbitrary social interaction is a target. Such training aims to bring forth a new generation of interdisciplinary scientist who will be equipped to integrate studies of brain, behavior and social function within a much needed dynamical framework NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will address the development of catalysts for the stereoselective formation of C-C bonds using nitroalkanes.  The ease of deprotonation adjacent to nitroalkanes along with their facile conversion to other functionality such as amines and ketones makes them attractive targets for reaction control.  Organocatalysts have been developed that achieve asymmetric conjugate addition of nitroalkanes with a variety of substrates, presumably through non-covalent stabilization of the anionic intermediates.  Catalyst design continues through investigation of additional scaffolds that are complementary to nitroalkane structure as well as expanding the scope of applicable nitroalkanes. With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Linton of the Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College.  Professor Linton's research efforts revolve around the development of molecular catalysts that control the reactions of nitroalkanes.  Since stereoselective syntheses are required for numerous pharmaceutical and biological substrates, these catalysts have broad applicability to a wide variety of relevant target molecules.  Additionally this approach uses environmentally friendly organocatalysts that can perform these reactions with minimal use of reagents and minimal production of waste NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PI: Gurmukh (Guri) S. Johal, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: Clifford F. Weil, Purdue UniversityCo-PI: James. W. Moyer, North Carolina State UniversityCo-PI: Peter J. Balint-Kurti, North Carolina State UniversityPlant disease resistance (R) genes encode proteins that respond to pathogen invasion by triggering a rapid, localized  hypersensitive reaction  (HR), in which host tissue immediately adjacent to the site of infection undergoes programmed cell death. Although, HR is a fundamental part of the immune response in plants, very little is known about the genes that trigger, signal, execute, and then contain it. Exhaustive mutagenesis screens have been conducted in Arabidopsis, but have turned up only a few genes linked to HR, possibly because of genetic redundancy or lethality of HR mutants. An alternate and potentially huge resource of HR variation is available in natural germplasm.  If effectively tapped and delineated, this resource has the potential to advance considerably our understanding of HR . By taking advantage of a constitutive-active allele of the Rp1 gene, which confers resistance to the common rust disease of maize, we have demonstrated that the maize germplasm contains vast amounts of variation capable of impacting HR. This project will test the broad use of an innovative approach, which looks for naturally occurring alleles that suppress mutant phenotypes to rapidly detect and explore natural variation underlying HR. Using this approach, one HR-modulating locus (Hrml1) has already been identified and mapped in a preliminary test using the IBM population of maize; this QTL will be cloned.  In addition, many more QTL will be identified and characterized by broadening the screen to the 5000-line Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population currently available to the maize community. The broader impacts of the project are many-fold.  First, the approach of discovering and harnessing genetic diversity is likely to be broadly applicable to a large number of important traits in most plant species. Second, an outreach component will bring the uses of biodiversity to middle school curricula (Grades 6-8) and the topics of DNA sequence analysis and quantitative trait analysis to high school curricula, with the development and test of teaching materials that can be widely distributed.  Third, these teaching modules will be developed for and with students from a wide range of cultural, racial and educational backgrounds, and their teachers.  This approach will allow development of several versions of these modules, using different examples, different assessments and different forms of presentation so that they can be applied  effectively in a variety of settings.  The goal is to overturn the stereotype that these subjects are too complex for middle and high school students to grasp, and to prime student to investigate plant diversity and genetics in greater detail later in their education so that they are better able to understand the issues.  These topics are not generally covered in most science curricula at these levels, despite their increasing importance scientifically and socially. The outcomes and biological resources generated by this project will be available through the project website: http://www.Rp1-MAGIC.purdue.edu NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0744310TullerThis proposal seeks funding to upgrade the Weighing Lysimeter Facility at the University of Arizona. The facility is designed to measure plant water uptake and solute transport and will teaching, research and outreach. The currently-configured facility (built in the early 1990s) has three 45,000 kg lysimeters which can be weighed with an accuracy of ±200g. Due to long use, the system is currently in need of repair for corrosion damage, recalibration and upgrades to provide data logging and modern sensor capabilities. The upgraded system will allow research on soil hydrogeologic processes in arid environments which comprise a considerable area of the US southwest. The facility will be used to study the coupled ecosystem and soil hydrological processes - at the mesoscale. The sustainability of water resources in arid environments will be evaluated in collaboration with researchers at the Desert Research Institute (DRI). Vegetation and hydrologic responses to varying precipitation patters will be evaluated in different desert environments (e.g. Majove vs. Sonoran desert). The facility will interface with large-scale studies at the University of Arizona?s Biosphere 2 which will be instrumental in predicting landscape processes. The upgrade will consist of repairs, instrumenting real-time lysimeter data streams, producing a web resource which will create an Instructional Environmental Observatory (IEO), and create a foundation for collaborative research on coupled soil hydrological and ecosystem processes in arid environments. Funding will be shared with PIs' startup monies. A part-time technician will be provided by the Department of Soil, Water & Environmental Science. Water issues in the desert southwest carry tremendous societal impacts. Pumping rates in arid regions vastly exceed recharge rates for sensitive aquifers. Education and outreach will be fostered through the creation of an IEO accessible by undergraduate and graduate students through research efforts and through courses in Soil & Environmental Sciences, Hydrology, Ecology, Natural Resources, and Engineering. The IEO will also be made available to the public and environment stakeholders NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer gaming and simulations enjoy great popularity and are used by the military and corporate world to enhance training. Their potential to support science learning, however, is relatively untapped. The Board on Science Education (BOSE) at the National Research Council (NRC) proposes to hold a two-day workshop to explore the connections between what is known about science learning and computer gaming and simulations, the role computer gaming and simulations could play in assessing learning, and the pathways by which they could be used on a large scale. The workshop will be the basis for the development of a research agenda to gain a better of understanding of how gaming and simulations can support learning and assessment in science NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Humans have an amazing facility in switching attention between two or more ongoing tasks. This kind of cognitive flexibility allows for successful navigation of the demands of everyday life, but it declines with aging. Recent results have shown that such age-related declines are not as severe in lifelong bilinguals; speaking more than one language on a regular basis since childhood seems to provide some protection from this general effect. Current cognitive models suggest that the basis of this boost relates to the fact that bilinguals are constantly switching between multiple languages, which serves to strengthen task switching and related executive control processes. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Brian Gold and his colleagues at the University of Kentucky will conduct experiments designed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological bases of bilingual advantages in executive control processes. The methods used will include standard behavioral experiments and neuroimaging studies conducted with monolingual and bilingual participants. In behavioral studies, participants will engage in task switching and working memory paradigms and reaction time and accuracy data will be recorded. Results will explore whether bilingualism strengthens just those processes that directly replicate the bilingual experience, or if it serves to bolster other executive control processes, such as memory updating. The neuroimaging studies will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods to understand the neurobiological bases of bilingual performance advantages. The fMRI experiment will identify variations in bilingual brain activation patterns that correlate with their advantages on executive control tasks. The DTI measures will identify variations in white matter microstructure in bilinguals, ones that correlate with the advantages on executive control tasks. The experiments will provide a more precise understanding of the cognitive and neurobiological variables that seem to be protected by lifelong bilingualism. Results from the present project will be relevant to the question of how accessible lifestyle variables can influence neuroplasticity and/or compensatory brain reserve in aging. It will also provide research training and mentoring to a postdoctoral fellow and two undergraduate research assistants. Trainees will acquire knowledge in neuroanatomy, and the analysis of neuroimaging data. This project will provide information about the relationship between second language learning and neurobiology, an issue of fundamental relevance in our increasingly multilingual society NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Iron and Copper serve as key co-constituents for numerous enzymes in a wide range of biological systems, and their elevated or impoverished levels in aqueous systems have dramatic consequences at organismal, ecosystem, and human health scales. Over the last decade these effects have increasingly been recognized to be important in ocean systems. Identifying sites and times where these metals cause negative environmental outcomes is greatly hampered by their comparatively sparse datasets. This problem is a direct consequence of the analytical challenge of obtaining accurate Fe and Cu determinations in saline waters at very low (trace) concentrations, and the limitations of ship-dependent sampling regimes. The PI?s request funding to build on research and technology advances in the Tripp, Wells and King laboratories to develop active nanostructures that can serve as platforms amenable for detection of a wide range of environmentally important dissolved metals in seawater. Preliminary work has validated a biologically-inspired sensor platform in the subarctic N. Pacific, providing the first demonstration of dissolved Fe measurements at very low (Broader Impacts:This project has the potential to further develop a sensor that will provide unique information about the chemical speciation of the biologically important metals Fe and Cu. The work proposed here fills an important need for high spatial and temporal resolution data of these metals identified as priority by researchers in marine chemistry and marine biogeochemistry. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to fill an analytical void for data that continues to stymie efforts to understand how and Cu and more specifically Fe availability in the oceans modulates the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in the marine environment. The proposal is well balanced in its goal of marrying nanotechnology with IR spectroscopy to address a analytical void while providing specific support for the training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The PIs plan to develop minority student involvement in their research. This will have the most important impact, since bringing smart students into our field and stimulating young students to consider careers in science is essential for the continued growth of our national science capabilities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER EVOLVING NONLINEAR FORCE-FREE MAGNETIC MODELS OF THE SOLAR CORONA Despite considerable progress in observing the structure and evolution of the solar corona the root causes of many phenomena remain elusive. The dynamics associated with coronal heating pro NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal responds to the need for realizing the potential of cyber-infrastructure for education and argues that in order for cyber-enabled learning to be realized and used, three important issues must be addressed: (a) It is critical to be able to characterize what is meant by cyber-enabled learning; (b) multiple approaches to gathering evidence of sophisticated cyber-enabled learning must be developed; and (c) learning must be attributable to participation in the identified cyber-enabled learning. The project, therefore, has three goals: (1) to characterize cyber-enabled learning using a case study; (2) to identify the assessment and psychometric issues related to assessing cyber-enabled learning; and (3) to propose methodological solutions to modeling learning in such complex learning environments. The focus of the stduy is on a substantial case study in geoscience, which employs science content that is accessible to a wide range of the education community, and which draws on known areas of research, particularly scientific visualization: the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and related phenomena. This project asks: What is the character of analytical reasoning for geoscience within a networked, cyber-infrastructure framework, and what counts as evidence for such reasoning? What assessment and psychometric issues must be addressed? What are the methodological challenges in modeling and assessing learning within this cyber-infrastructure project? For example, how are claims of causality handled in a complex networked and nested learning environment, and what evidence would make such claims credible? This project addresses potentially new concepts by examining the transformative and dynamic nature of cyber-infrastructure NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER number: 0850774PI: John BransfordTitle: 2009 Inter-Science of Learning Centers (iSLC) ConferenceThe 2009 Inter-Science of Learning Centers (iSLC) Conference is the second annual conference for students and postdoctoral fellows from the six NSF Science of Learning Centers (SLCs).  This is a venue for participants to meet at one of the SLCs on a rotating basis, to discuss common research interests, methodologies, challenges and career development.  The goals are to facilitate information exchange, collaborative synergies and sharing of resources (people, ideas and tools) between the centers.  The 2009 meeting will be hosted by the Learning in Informal and Formal Environments (LIFE) Center at the University of Washington, and attended by approximately 90 students and postdoctoral fellows.  This annual iSLC Conference is a step towards breaking down disciplinary barriers and creating a common framework for the scientific study of learning NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Binding Principles, perhaps the most well studied principles in human language, state where in a sentence nominals (e.g., pronouns, common and proper nouns, etc.) may occur, and what they may/may not refer to. Many prominent researchers argue that these principles are part of our innate linguistic endowment because (i) they occur in the vast majority of languages for which we have data, and (ii) children in every language studied to date exhibit them at the very earliest testable ages. This argument for innateness is threatened somewhat by the existence of a handful of languages, e.g., Thai, in which the Binding Principles appear not to hold. If these principles are innate, exceptional languages like Thai should not exist.So why don't Thai speakers obey the Binding Principles? Thai children hold the answer to this puzzle: if Thai children, unlike Thai adults, exhibit knowledge of the Binding Principles at young ages, this will show that the principles are indeed part of our innate linguistic endowment, and that as children mature, they 'unlearn' these principles on the basis of adult input. However, if Thai children show no evidence of the Binding Principles at any stage in development, this will suggest that the principles are not innate. If this is the case, children acquiring other languages (e.g., English) do not have access to these innate principles, and must simply learn them on the basis of experience and other (non-linguistic) mechanisms. This project will test 80 Thai children aged 3yrs-7yrs and 20 adult Thai speakers on six experiments, each targeting a different aspect of the Binding Principles. The project will not only address one of the biggest debates in cognitive science (nature versus nurture), but it will also gather data from an understudied language, as well as establish and foster relations between academic institutions in Thailand and the United States. Moreover, this work will lay the foundation for the development of standards for the acquisition of Thai that may be used for Speech Pathology or educational assessment purposes NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Drafting a Blueprint for Teaching Tomorrow's Engineers Today is a two-year MSP Start-Partnership that is bringing together students, educators, and industry to hold continued conversations in which partners discuss, define, discover, and design a clear path that leads to an MSP Targeted Partnership. This partnership will have three goals: 1) increase awareness about engineering by the 5,692 middle school (grades 6 - 8) students in the Springfield Public Schools (SPS); 2) improve the knowledge base of approximately 240 future and in-service middle school teachers so that they will have the skills, materials, and enthusiasm to excite their students about engineering; and 3) create a fluid and dynamic engineering education pipeline where each level (industry, four year college programs, two year college programs, K-12 schools) informs the preceding level about the skill base needed to ensure success. The goal of this initial work is a partnership that will leverage the expertise of all its participants, connections, and experience to accelerate the development of methodologies and techniques in STEM teaching, growing the pool of subject matter and expertise available to all STEM teachers, thereby increasing the diversity of thought and practice. Increased understanding of STEM concepts helps remove the fear factor and allows students to achieve a comfort level characterized by curiosity and creativity in these areas, inspiring them to continue to pursue STEM projects and classes and make relevant connections between STEM concepts and the analysis and solution of real world problems. Teachers will become an integral part of a dynamic, supportive network of college faculty and business and industry partners that will provide sustained support and be responsive to the changing needs of both teachers and students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The State of Alabama has committed to expanding and sustaining its bioscience and nanotechnology resources, providing opportunities for K-20 synergism and leveraging of state resources.  With an ultimate objective to have all students prepared and well grounded in math and science technology, thereby improving the economic landscape for future scientists, researchers, and technicians, this MSP-Start project is researching, planning, and developing a full MSP Partnership between an EPSCoR program, nano- and biotechnology industries in Alabama, the Alabama Department of Education, and Alabama public school systems.  A distinctive characteristic of this work is that it brings together the highly organized Alabama Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (ALEPSCoR) into a partnership to promote STEM education in K-12 schools, with a vision of using ALEPSCoR programming and institutions to raise academic standards and student performance.  The long-term goals of the new partnership are:      1.  To improve current K-12 programs by raising student achievement levels through cooperation of existing NSF-supported nanotechnology, biotechnology and sensor ALEPSCoR research groups, the Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI), and school districts throughout Alabama.      2.  To change the culture of higher education through training of ALEPSCoR-sponsored graduate students - the next generation of researchers and innovators - on education and outreach activities.      3.  To research and evaluate a method for incorporating EPSCoR research-based activities into K-12 programs in other EPSCoR states as an innovative partnership model. The MSP-Start project builds on existing educational partnerships to form a comprehensive new MSP Partnership, through a process led by Alabama teachers and faculty at Tuskegee University, Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University, Auburn University, and campuses of the University of Alabama system.  The scope of work for the participants in the MSP-Start project is to develop plans to leverage their strengths while evolving the new partnership, especially addressing all of the components of the national MSP program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports research and education on emergent properties of highly correlated electronic systems. The main thrust of the research undertaken here is the effort at  theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors of interacting electrons (i.e. new states of matter) as well as new regimes of parameters in which familiar states of matter behave in new and different ways. In addition, some of the research explores qualitatively the relation between the microscopic interactions between electrons and the effective parameters that control the macroscopic behavior of solids.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work is based on an analogy between classical liquid crystals and corresponding phases of strongly interacting electrons.  Electronic liquid crystals are quantum states with behaviors intermediate between a Fermi liquid and a Wigner crystal. Examples of such states have recently been observed experimentally: the anisotropic states (quantum Hall nematics) that are seen in high mobility quantum Hall devices and the metamagnetic nematic phase that has recently been identified in Sr3Ru2O7. The more microscopic issues to be addressed involve the physics of the superconducting Tc. A number of questions are addressed theoretically.  What is it about superconductivity that causes transition temperatures, generally, to be so low, while other orders, such as ferromagnetism, frequently onset at much higher temperatures? Why is there, in the cuprate high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' doping at which Tc is maximal ? what is there an excess of in ''overdoped'' cuprates? Are there optimal mesoscale structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance the strength of the electron pairing without too strongly suppressing the superfluid stiffness? The research also seeks to interpret the importance of evidence of wide-spread mesoscale inhomogeneities in the cuprates ? both self-organized (i.e. stripes) and nucleated by disorder. The research is motivated by a need to clarify  whether these observations are complicating details or essential to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on exotic properties and unexplained electronic states  of unusual materials. The broad thrust of the research undertaken here is the theoretical characterization of qualitatively new behaviors and new states of matter as well as investigating how familiar forms matter can be made to behave in new and different ways. This research explores these unusual states of matter by looking at the behavior of electrons and the microscopic level of the atoms that make up the material and then connecting those behaviors with the large scale properties which are seen in the material as a solid whole.The search for new states of matter continues an ongoing effort by the PI in the theory of ''electronic liquid crystals.'' This work develops theories of why some materials have electrons that are not just quiescently distributed more or less uniformly but which instead group together in various patterns.The  issues to be addressed also involve the physics of the superconducting materials, those which can conduct electricity with no resistance and thus no waste of energy. The questions are quite basic.  What is it about superconductivity that causes working temperatures, generally, to be so low? Why is there, in some high temperature superconductors, an ''optimal'' composition at which the working temperature is highest? Are there optimal ways of creating structures for superconductivity, structures that enhance performance? The research is motivated by a need to clarify which experimental  observations are complicating details and which are essential clue to discovering to the mechanism needed to explain high temperature superconductivity.The effort undertaken has  broader impacts with  both scientific and educational consequences. Scientifically, there is impact in extending the understanding of the origins of high temperature superconductivity because that opens new theoretical opportunities as well as providing better ability to design materials with this highly desirable property.  Involving students and postdoctoral researchers in the diverse   problems and theoretical techniques used  provides an exceptional training for talented young people. Past students and postdoctoral researchers have gone on to university faculty positions and their own careers in teaching and research and some have found successful positions in high tech companies and a variety of other fields outside of mainstream physics NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Alboran Sea was created in the wake of the young subduction zones that swept across the Western Mediterranean in the Neogene during the convergence of Africa and Europe.  The Gibraltar Arc and Alboran Sea are the westernmost part of the system and one of the most confusing.  The mixture of westward rollback, extension, strike-slip, volcanism, uplift and subsidence has defied attempts to compose a consistent scenario that explains all of the obervations.  Partly as a result of inadequate data, there are many models that have been proposed involving subduction, slab breakoff, delamination and drips.  There is credible evidence that the lithospheric mantle of the overriding plate of a west-facing subduction zone has been thinned by both back-arc stretching and some type of convective removal (e.g. drips, delamination, etc.).  The process of convective thinning is poorly understood but is believed to be important in driving uplift and subsidence of the Earth?s surface, influencing rates of deformation in active orogens, and contributing to recycling of continental materials back into the mantle.  This award provides for a multidisciplinary, international investigation of the Alboran Sea, Gibraltar arc, Atlas Mountains and surrounding areas in the western Mediterranean using passive and active seismology, magnetotellurics, geochemistry, petrology/structural geology, and geodynamic modeling.  The overall goal of the project is to study the processes responsible for convective thinning in the Gibraltar-Alboran Sea region.  The project, known as PICASSO, has now been funded in Spain and Ireland as a colloaborative EU-US program, with proposals from a number of other EU nations submitted or in process.  The project was selected as the pilot experiment for TopoEurope, an EarthScope-like initiative recently approved by the European Science Foundation.  A large part of the field deployments will be done by European scientists, including a 3D EarthScope-type rolling array (IberArray), with additional targeted field experiments by US investigators.  The IberArray is already underway with ~60 stations deployed in the PICASSO field area NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER An award has been made to Dr. Gregory Buck of Virginia Commonwealth University for a study of genomic diversity and evolution in the Euglenozoa, a diverse group of microscopic unicellular protists..  The group includes model organisms as well as important human parasites.  The evolutionary relationships of these poorly studied unicellular organisms are not well understood. Euglenozoa are micro-organisms of enormous significance to the environment, the economy, and to public health. One group, the trypanosomatids, which are responsible for human and agricultural diseases, have been extensively studied. However, other members of the phylum have only been loosely characterized, and their taxonomic relationships are very poorly defined.  In this project, the genomes of five exemplar species will be examined in detail, and a smaller set of genes from each of several hundred strategically selected species of Euglenozoa will be also examined and compared for a broad study of the group. The goal is to use state-of-the-art gene sequencing technologies to elucidate the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships of group. Novel strategies of computational biology will be applied to develop new insights into how the diverse feeding and life history traits of these organisms have evolved. The project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral trainees at Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Georgia, and Michigan State University.  Students will be recruited for a summer program in bioinformatics and bioengineering to conduct independent research related to this project.  High school teachers and students from underrepresented groups will also participate in the program.  Three of the senior research personnel on the project are Hispanic.  The research on Euglenozoa will be incorporated into several summer workshop programs for high school students, as well as a graduate level course in evolutionary biology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CBET-0828655BarthelmieOptimal spacing of wind turbines in large wind farm arrays depends in part on turbine interactions, i.e. wind turbine wakes that are maximized at close spacing. Wakes are the volume downwind of individual turbines where wind speed is reduced and turbulence is enhanced due to energy extraction at the preceding turbine. In large offshore wind farms, power losses due to wakes can exceed 20% of total potential power production and lead to an increase in fatigue loading reducing turbine lifetimes. The objective of the research is to quantify and improve predictive capability for the development, propagation, combination and dissipation of wind turbine wakes in large onshore wind farms.  Wake models used in current wind farm prediction tools under-predict power losses in large wind farms. There are two potential explanations; (1) large wind farms create additional turbulence which fundamentally alters the structure of the overlying boundary-layer, (2) combining wakes from individual turbines both downwind and laterally is mis-specified by the current generation of wind farm models. Evaluation of the models in small wind farms (three rows or smaller) indicates that models are able to capture power losses due to wakes which lends support to these two hypotheses that pertain to large multi-row arrays. This project will combine statistical analysis of observed wind farm data with evaluation and development of three classes of models (from the analytic to computational fluid dynamics codes) to improve predictions of wake losses. The goal is to produce a model that accurately captures wake propagation and interactions in different wind speed, turbulence and atmospheric stability conditions, to model wake combination in a more realistic way and to account for changes in the structure of the boundary-layer. Ultimately, this will produce a model which accurately quantifies wake losses for existing wind farm layouts and will allow assessment of wind farm layouts (turbine spacing) which are optimized for wake losses.  The outcome from this project will contribute unique insight into how wakes propagate through large wind farms, and transform the ways in which wake impacts on power output are modeled.This project will be led by Professor R.J. Barthelmie, a renowned leader in wind energy research, and will be conducted in collaboration with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Airtricity/E.ON, a world leading renewable energy company. Both have agreed to provide data from operating large wind farms and to collaboration on model application and evaluation. This collaboration will both enhance the project and increase symbioses and knowledge transfer. The project will also enhance educational and training opportunities at Indiana University NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Building on their experience of developing and testing four hands-on, inquiry-based modules for the study of engineering/technology education at the high school level, an established, multidisciplinary team extends their work with a professional development model that implements those modules. A module on medical technology is added that addresses the Standards for Technological Literacy.  The module uses real-world examples and practicing engineers and technicians to introduce students to engineering design, analysis and decision-making processes.  This project advances knowledge about effective instruction and curriculum design in engineering/technology education in order to achieve public literacy and better preparation for the next generation of engineering and technology professionals, including teachers.  A model is designed, developed and tested that delivers effective teacher professional development to both inservice and preservice teachers to enable the successful implementation of engineering curricula.  Hypothesis-driven research is performed to evaluate the individual and combined impacts of the curricular materials and the teacher professional development framework on classroom instructional practices and student learning, interests and attitudes and to evaluate which curriculum components are most effective in promoting student learning and interest as a function of gender and ethnicity NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Collaborative Research: Project IBORC: Interaction between Building and Occupant Responses during CollapseAbstractThe primary objective of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary investigation ? at the intersection of structural engineering, social science, and computer science ? of how building occupants respond to signals issued by a building during and immediately after a compromising event that threatens its integrity. Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research. The project will furthermore contribute to the state-of-the-art in hazards research by developing knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help building occupants, their rescuers and city officials respond appropriately during extreme events NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Evaporation from the soil largely determines both water availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and the partitioning of solar radiation between sensible and latent heat. It is key to both hydrology and climate. The evaporation process is complex, involving movement and phase change of water, varying with depth and time. Following water inputs, evaporation occurs at the soil surface, controlled by atmospheric demand. As surface soil water is depleted, evaporation becomes soil-limited and shifts below the surface; nonetheless it is generally viewed as a strictly surface process. As a result, measurement methods and understanding of these near-surface phenomena have lagged behind demand for accurate data. Much current research emphasizes large-scale areal estimates of soil moisture and temperature, but poor understanding of the soil water evaporation process causes low accuracy in water and energy balances. This poor understanding is largely due to our current inability to make the needed measurements.The purpose of the proposed research is to develop and test a new approach to measure evaporation within the soil. Recently developed sensors and concepts enable us to quantify sensible heat transferred into and out of mm-scale near-surface soil layers, as well as the change in sensible heat stored within each layer. Combined with conservation of energy, these measurements can locally quantify subsurface evaporation, showing the temporal patterns of in situ evaporation. Research will test four hypotheses: (1) that a sensible heat balance method can accurately estimate the mass of water evaporated from subsurface soil layers, (2) that the heat balance method can be extended to determine the latent heat flux from the soil surface layer (0-3 mm), (3) that through combined heat and mass balance, estimates of other hydrological components (transpiration and soil water flow) will be quantified or constrained, and (4) that the sensible heat balance method can quantitatively partition ET into evaporation and transpiration. Hypotheses 1-3 will be tested with both laboratory and field experiments, and Hypothesis 4 only by field experiments. Laboratory experiments will measure soil thermal properties, water content, and water flux under a combination of 2 energy regimes, 3 surface conditions, and 3 soils. Calculated evaporative loss via heat balance will be compared to evaporation measured by mass balance. In the field experiments, independent measurements of evaporation and transpiration will allow rigorous testing of heat balance estimates of transpiration and soil water evaporation.The intellectual merit of the proposed work is a new measurement-based methodology for quantifying soil water evaporation. The proposed research addresses current knowledge gaps by developing and testing in situ soil water evaporation measurement with novel sensors and analysis. Information obtained in the study will elucidate important evaporative processes. The research will quantify observation of soil water evaporation at and below the soil surface. This represents a notable advancement over descriptions of evaporation as a surface-only process.The proposed work carries broader impact by providing educational, scientific, and societal opportunities. Fundamental experience is provided for an early-career scientist, graduate students (including a minority student who is a NSF AGEP Fellow), and undergraduates. Results will be widely disseminated to the scientific community via website and published articles, and measurement techniques will have immediate repercussions for weather, climate, and environmental monitoring. Achieving the project goals will significantly improve our understanding of fundamental critical-zone properties and processes, enable better environmental monitoring and management, and enhance our predictions of large-scale hydrological and climate dynamics NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SES-0817659Rachel L. EinwohnerPurdue UniversityThis study asks: Why does resistance take place in some situations but not others? What conditions facilitated the emergence of collective armed resistance? While current theories of social movement emergence argue that collective action occurs when groups of individuals have opportunity, resources, and a sense of efficacy, this study will make a contribution by examining resistance under conditions of extreme repression, limited resources, and great despair.  This research will study Jewish victims of the Holocaust who are commonly portrayed as passive individuals. Yet well known cases of Jewish resistance such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising demonstrate that in at least some places, Jews did rise up against their oppressors. Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe therefore provide a useful setting for an empirical study of the emergence of collective resistance under extreme circumstances. This project will make a contribution to the extant literature by examining an understudied context for collective action and use the results to develop new theoretical models. The investigator will conduct in-depth qualitative analysis and compare three strategically selected case studies: the Warsaw Ghetto (where collective Jewish resistance occurred), the Vilna Ghetto (where collective resistance was planned but not achieved), and the Lodz Ghetto (where collective resistance was never attempted). Data will include both primary and secondary sources, including transcripts from a random sample (N=120) of archived oral testimonies from survivors of each ghetto (40 from each ghetto). These testimonies are housed at the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation Institute. Oral testimony data will be analyzed using the qualitative software package NVivo.The study?s broader impacts are both educational and policy-related. First, the project will help contribute to extant knowledge about collective action and contentious politics in general. Although the results are intended primarily for professional academic audiences, they may also be used in other educational settings (e.g., Holocaust education in public schools). In addition, to the extent that they are disseminated more widely (e.g., through the media), the findings can also have an impact on the general public?s understanding of the Holocaust, especially by helping to dispel the myth of Jewish passivity. Lastly, the findings will have relevance to contemporary cases of resistance such as armed insurgencies, prison revolts and urban riots NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The  Mathematics Teacher Transformation Institutes  (MTTI) project is a research-based investigation of how leadership emerges and is expressed through mathematics knowledge, student-focused instructional practices, and influences on schools' mathematics outcomes.  In particular, this research is broadening the knowledge base on teaching and learning in mathematics through new understanding of how the study of conceptually-challenging mathematics, particularly in algebra and geometry, benefits second-stage teachers (4-10 years' experience); of how classroom-based action research contributes to critical and analytical understanding of the relationships between teaching practices and student learning; and of how multi-levels of support prepare second-stage teachers for leadership roles. To achieve these research objectives, the City University of New York (CUNY), Herbert H. Lehman College is partnering with New York City Department of Education Districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.  Lehman College faculty in mathematics and mathematics education, staff of education centers and institutes who work in Bronx schools, and the Superintendents of Bronx districts work together to engage 80 experienced middle or high school teachers in the Bronx in 330 hours of professional development over 3 years to strengthen their leadership abilities, mathematics abilities, and educational practices.  These MTTI teacher participants are further supported on-site at their schools and through on-line discussion forums and are provided opportunities to showcase their work.  MTTI cultivates a professional network of mathematics teacher leaders who provide leadership to 200 additional middle and high school mathematics teachers as they enact a variety of roles including mentor, peer coach, presenter, conference participant/speaker, and active member of school curriculum and professional development teams.  Additionally, they participate in local and national discussions of current policy, practice, and research, and they develop informed understandings of the strengths and challenges of culturally and linguistically diverse classes.  Upon completion of the Institute, participants receive a Certificate for Secondary-School Mathematics Specialists through CUNY's School of Professional Studies of the Graduate School and University Center, registered with New York State Education Department NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Arizona State University (ASU) in collaboration with Phoenix Union High School District, Scottsdale Union High School District, Roosevelt District, Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton, Intel, Applied Learning Technologies Institute, Dynamic Educational Leadership for Teachers and Administrators (D.E.L.T.A.), ASU's School of Computing & Informatics, ASU's Video Game Design Camp, and Arizona Council of Black Engineers and Scientists Computer Camp (ACBES), are conducting a culturally relevant multimedia program strategy, COMPUGIRLS. Drawing on three well-documented frameworks, Culturally Relevant Pedagogical practices (CRP), Social Justice Youth Development Framework, and Future Time Perspective, this after-school and summer program fosters in IT/STEM related outcomes for 100 adolescent (grades 8-12) girls from several Phoenix high needs districts and schools. COMPUGIRLS takes place at two sites, ASU and the Boys and Girls Club of the East Valley-Sacaton. Already, 40 girls have completed one-year of the program. This project expands the program to include another 60 students, their parents, ASU graduate students and in-service teachers, and peer mentors. COMPUGIRLS provides hands-on technology experiences that include internships, Advanced Placement credit, conference and community presentations, and parent workshops that will ultimately develop participants' techno-social analytic skills for real world problems.As part of their experience, students visit ASU. For many, this is the first time they have been on a college campus. Students participate in 6 multimedia courses: 1) social justice and the media, 2) SCRATCH, user-friendly computer programming, 3) modding SIMS, designing, modifying, and troubleshooting simplified simulations, 4) choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, 5) advanced choice of 3-D, programming, and character design, and 6) teamwork to create neighborhoods in Sim City using all skills learned. Participants' projects will be disseminated semi-annually through community ceremonies, web pages, and presentations.The project builds upon a pilot program (Summer 2007 to present) that accommodated 40 girls from under-resourced districts in the Phoenix metro area. The COMPUGIRLS program is a two-year curriculum using multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking. The project advances understanding of how to encourage girls (including girls from underrepresented groups) to pursue ICT fields. It builds upon established research and includes evaluation of the impact on participants' computational thinking, techno-social analytical skills, attitudes about and interest in pursuing further education and careers in ICT/STEM fields. The goals are:1) To use multimedia activities as a means of encouraging computational thinking; 2) To enhance girls' techno-social analytical skills; and 3) To provide the building blocks for Arizona girls from underrepresented groups to successfully traverse an ICT and/or any work force roadmap. The evaluation of the project consists of a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative), incorporating the use of survey instruments, student journals, focus groups, interviews, document review, observation and an intensive case study. A comparison/control group is incorporated into the pre- and post-test design to determine the extent the participants' skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors changed relative to where they would have been without participation in the project NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data.  In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Designing a response to global climate change requires analysis tools that can help decision makers understand the tradeoffs between the cost of a policy and its benefit in the form of avoided climate change. Both the costs and the benefits, however, are uncertain. To date, models used in studies of climate change have not represented all the critical uncertainties. One important omission is the representation of uncertainty in returns to research and development (R&D) directed to the improvement of energy technologies. Studies on R&D have shown that such returns are uncertain and highly skewed (i.e., have a small probability of a very large breakthrough). Ignoring this uncertainty and focusing on the average effect will produce biased estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet particular targets or the relative balance between near-term emissions constraints and investments in energy technology R&D.This research will improve the analysis tools available to decision makers by developing a model framework that explicitly represents the uncertainty in the returns to R&D. The representation of technical change and its relation to R&D expenditure will be calibrated to historical experience with U.S. patents. The model will also improve the representation of the uncertainty in the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions by constraining that uncertainty to a range consistent with 20th century climate. These components will be integrated into a single framework that can be used to explore decision making about emissions reductions and R&D expenditures under uncertainty.The results of this research will improve the analysis facilities that are applied to climate change assessment. The new tools are expected to give improved guidance in the timing of emissions reductions and investments in technology R&D by eliminating biases in current models NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CBET-0838607DozierThe WATERS Network is an initiative to transform science and engineering of the water environment.  The goal is to create a national capability to better predict and manage the behavior of water-and its nutrients, contaminants, and sediments-everywhere in the U.S.  Population growth, evolving land use, and climate change make the future water environment uncertain, so prediction and management require understanding along with statistical relationships, and thereby require integration among people who study how water moves and transforms landscapes; who manage and treat water to ensure potable supplies and prevent floods; and who consider how humans, institutions, and managed systems respond to and superimpose variability on quality, scarcity, or hazard. Driving the requirement for an integrated, collaboratively developed infrastructure is the recognition that we have to predict and manage water nationwide.  Predicting Water Quality and Quantity Everywhere at All Times (WQ2EAT) requires a judicious integration of models and syn-thesis, cyberinfrastructure, education and outreach, existing networks, and remotely sensed data, along with new measurements, analyses, and experiments at a realistic number of carefully chosen sites or basins.  A network of observational and experimental facilities, where processes are studied and manipulated, will provide knowledge that can be transferred to any location on the continent.  The proposed network spans the domain of water environments-pristine, rural, and urban areas and constructed networks and facilities for management and treatment.  The capacity for prediction ranges from episodic events such as floods and storm-water overflows, through seasonal spring runoff and surges of agricultural wastes, to multi-decadal projections.The task of the investigation is to create a prototype network design that will enable detailed specification and budgeting to prepare for a conceptual design review.  The investigation will analyze existing sources of data across a domain representing the extant human-influenced water environment, conduct modeling exercises to identify new measurement needs and predict in locations where we lack intensive measurements, and scrutinize emerging technologies and different variables to observe at different scales.  Alternative observational designs, as well as experimental facilities and campaigns, will be evaluated according to their capability to support key scientific objectives. The WATERS Network will help us understand and predict the ways in which heterogeneous processes interact with one another at different scales to produce the variability found in the water environment.  Knowledge about explicitly scale-dependent processes will thereby inform options for management and engineering design. Water for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial processes is perhaps humanitys most fundamental need.  Our traditional methods of predicting and managing water and its quality are based on statistical relations developed when human impacts were isolated and climate was relatively stable.  These boundary conditions are changing, hence the need for new fundamental understanding.  The WATERS Network focuses on the U.S., but the knowledge gained and the technologies developed will apply globally NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Lead Partner:  Michigan Technological UniversityCore Partner: Grand Rapids Public Schools (GRPS)Supporting Partners: Grand Rapids Area Pre-College Engineering Program (GRAPCEP), Midwest National Parks, Cass Technical High School, American Geological Institute, Grand Valley State University Geology Department, Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center   Michigan Teaching Excellence Program (MITEP) is a multi-year program of teacher leadership development that empowers middle-grade science teachers to lead their schools and districts through the process of systematically improving science teaching and learning. The project uses Earth Systems Science(ESS)content and inquiry-based instructional practices to emphasize themes that unite all sciences and mathematics. MITEP includes both summer and academic-year components, and uses a variety of on-site, residential, field, distance, and in-service delivery methods. Components promote leadership skills, collaboration, urban place-based inquiry, access to cutting-edge data and materials, technology, engagement of diverse learners, study of key scientific concepts that cross disciplinary boundaries, pedagogical innovation. The project will also implement and test lessons and units that challenge students and prepare them for further science study. Teachers receive stipends and credit as incentive for participating in the project and testing its approach to reform.    The project is based on the premise that successful reform depends on the full involvement of teachers who have the skills to lead their colleagues through the process of developing and implementing new instructional approaches. MITEP teacher-leaders and research university faculty are full partners in the process. Teacher-leaders are at the forefront of their schools' and district's efforts to evaluate, design, implement, and test new inquiry-based instructional programs. MITEP teacher-leaders help develop common pacing schedules and  course assessments. They assist with planning  professional development activities and providing ongoing assistance to colleagues. MITEP teacher-leaders are encouraged to disseminate information about the project through presentations at state and national conferences, to submit papers for publication.     Teacher-led reform is strongly supported by the administration of the core school district partner as an innovative way to generate enthusiasm for curricular and instructional change. To encourage development of leadership skills, school administrators give teacher-leaders progressively increased responsibility for strengthening curriculum, improving instructional strategies, and designing assessments. District administrators are providing the resources required for teachers' success in implementing and coordinating the project by assisting with the selection of teachers with exceptional leadership qualities for participation in MITEP;assisting in the design of professional development activities that meet the needs of teachers and their students; providing flexibility in teachers' schedules; utilizing middle-grade teachers' expertise in the dissemination of information to primary and high-school teachers; recognizing, rewarding, and encouraging teachers who serve as leaders; fostering growth of a teacher network; and creating a district-wide atmosphere that nurtures teacher-led reform efforts NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Minority Student Pipeline Math Science Partnership (MSP)2 is led by Bowie State University (BSU)  with the additional core partners of the Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS), the Prince George's Community College (PGCC), the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI), and the University System of Maryland (USM).  (MSP)2 proposes to establish a strong, multifaceted partnership among the essential P-16 players in one of the largest minority-majority counties in the country, Prince George's County, Maryland, in order to expand the minority student pipeline in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in higher education.  (MSP)2 will employ four strategies engaging STEM faculty, teachers, undergraduates, and high school students: 1.  Working with approximately 750 teachers in grades 4-8 over five years,     science faculty will develop two different types of professional     development programs designed around principles of teaching and learning     through inquiry science. 2.  A total of 110 high school science teachers will engage in summer research    experiences over five years with college and university STEM faculty. 3.  At least 375 high school students over five years will be offered     opportunities to take challenging science courses through an innovative     early college/dual enrollment programs. 4.  100 undergraduate underrepresented minority college undergraduate students    will be offered opportunities for teaching experiences (with 100 PGCPS     science teachers to mentor them) and 50 undergraduate will be offered     research experiences over 5 years. (MSP)2 will explore four research strands through four implementation strategies:  (1) In what ways do different inquiry-based professional development experiences and training for elementary and middle school teachers influence students'interest in science? Are different models more effective at achieving different outcomes? How do these possible effects compare for underrepresented minority students and teachers versus non-minority?  (2) What characteristics of summer research opportunities for secondary science teachers, paired with intentional learning communities focused on the nature of scientific inquiry, lead to enhanced curriculum and greater success for students in science, particularly underrepresented minorities?  (3) In what ways do opportunities for secondary students to take early-college and dual-enrollment courses affect the likelihood that students, particularly underrepresented minorities, will attend college and choose science majors? And (4) How do opportunities for undergraduate science majors to teach science lessons in elementary and secondary schools affect the likelihood that science majors will consider a career in teaching? How do early research experiences affect the likelihood that STEM majors will complete science degrees NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER IMPACT MECHANICS AND CENTRAL PIT FORMATION ON ICY SATELLITES Central pit craters are an unusual morphological class of impact crater seen most commonly on the large icy satellites Ganymede and Callisto where they replace the peak-ring morphology expected NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The earliest detailed records of Australia's indigenous languages date from approximately two hundred years ago, and therefore our only access to the prehistory of Australia's indigenous past is through reconstruction in archeology and linguistics. While we know that humans have lived in Australia for more than 40,000 years, we do not know how speakers of the 250 currently attested languages came to live where they do today. This project uses linguistic evidence to trace the history of Aboriginal people in prehistoric times. Systematic similarities between words in these languages can be used to reconstruct various properties of prehistoric languages. These techniques will be used to determine the structure of the Pama-Nyungan language family, which will shed light on prehistoric population movements.Australia's linguistic prehistory is important for several reasons. It has been claimed that methods developed for Europe and the Americas do not work in Australia. If true, such a finding would be highly important, since these methods are based on properties of language change which until now have been assumed to be universal. However, preliminary work indicates that Australian languages show the same characteristics that we find elsewhere. Small speech community size, widespread multilingualism, and other factors have obscured relationships between these languages. These languages are an excellent laboratory for modeling what language change might have been like before the spread of agricultural communities. If we are ever going to be able to model accurately what prehistoric global language spread might have looked like, we need to understand how it operated in Australia NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The number of scientific journals and the number of papers published in those journals is increasing at a fast pace: currently, there are roughly 9,000 scientific journals, a twenty-fold increase from the 400 scientific journals available in 1955. The size and growth of the research literature places a tremendous burden on decision-making agents, such as funding agencies, university administrators, and reviewers, who have to evaluate the quality of research of individuals and institutions in a fast and efficient manner. In addition, the evaluation of individuals and institutions relies heavily on the assessment of the ultimate impact of published research, typically measured as the number of publications or the number of citations. Despite the oversimplification of using just a few numbers to quantify the scientific merit of a body of research, the entire science and technology community is relying more and more on citation-based statistics as a tool for evaluating the research performance of individuals and institutions and the development of tools that facilitate the evaluation task is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality standard for funded research.A major challenge is that stakeholders often want an estimate of the impact of a paper long before citations start to accumulate. This project aims precisely at facilitating such a task by developing tools to predict, soon after publication, the ultimate impact of research. This project uses longitudinal data available for papers published since 1955, drawing upon the concept that one can infer patterns of citation accumulation from large-scale analysis of historical data. Broader Impact: The outcome of this research is of relevance to decision makers that are called on to evaluate the productivity of researchers and institutions, as well as the impact of their work. The goal of this project is to develop transparent statistically-sound methods in order to enable institutions and funding agencies to make better informed decisions based on an objective assessment of the impact of published research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scientific communities in cyber-enabled infrastructures are socio-technical innovation systems that exhibit the characteristics of self-organizing complex adaptive systems. Using empirically grounded and conceptually valid agent simulation models of science, the project explores minimal structural and behavioral conditions, that is, the simplest set of assumptions, for the emergence and sustainment of creativity and innovation in Scientific Commons (SCs). The computer-aided ethnography software, called SC Browser, facilitates ethnographic observation of the social and technical networks in communities such as CreativeCommons, Scholarpedia, CollabRX, and OpenWetWare. Inspired by the Actor-Network Theory that focuses on translation networks involving human, symbolic, and physical actors, SC Browser is an advanced analytical tool that aggregates views of interaction among actors and at the same time preserve access to raw research material data sets for qualitative analysis and foundational hypothesis generation to construct computational simulations and to study co-evolution of scientific knowledge, community, and domain practices in the context of systems model of creativity.The simulation study (1) considers the discourse of scientific activity, including the contribution of new knowledge in virtual scientific commons, growth of the domain knowledge, and the clustering of research into specialties, (2) views science as an autonomous and self-regulating socio-cognitive system through the introduction of motivation and competitive nature of knowledge production, and (3) explores the impact of alternative community cultures (e.g., exploration-oriented, service-oriented, and utility-oriented), peer evaluation styles (e.g., centralized, decentralized) on the sustainability and innovation potential of SCs. Besides advancing the socio-technical and cultural understanding of cyber-enabled innovation communities, the project produces an integrated and customizable agent simulation framework, called SciSIM, for science policy mechanism design and decision analysis for virtual scientific communities to improve sustainable innovation.  Using SciSim, the project demonstrates how social networks and market mechanisms provide a sound formal basis to study dynamics of scientific communities using reliable and valid structural and organizational climate metrics.Broader Impacts: The project aims to facilitate training of students to develop computational thinking skills in Science and Technology (S&T) studies. As such, this research is expected to advance the state of the art in S&T curriculum via introduction of computational models as pedagogical instruments. Furthermore, the simulation environment and its associated models can be used by NSF administration for use as a computational laboratory for science policy analysis. Along with the findings of earlier work on Open Source Communities, this project aims to derive of common unifying principles innovation in scientific commons and their documentation via a book on the topic of Sustainable Creativity and Innovation in User Innovation Communities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER IMPROVED NUMERICAL MODELING OF GAS-SURFACE INTERACTION IN HYPERSONIC FLOWS  A modification to the NASA DPLR code is proposed to improve the capability of the tool to simulate detailed gas/surface interaction chemistry on TPS materials for applications to NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. Energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. Although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. Despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to Holocene and younger deposits. Although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. Within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. The largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms.Carbonate strata within the Proterozoic Atar Group, Mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. The wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the West African craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). Furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. This project, a collaboration between the University of Tennessee Knoxville and Ohio University, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact.This project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two Investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. Both investigators have a long history of public outreach. The University of Tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. These exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers inimplementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern Tennessee NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Enhanced Science of Science and Innovation Policy depends on better metrics. You can't manage what you can't measure.  This is particularly true for interdisciplinary research, which currently has few generally agreed-upon measures with acceptable degrees of accuracy.  Researchers at the University of Sussex have begun to address this problem by developing a conceptual framework to gauge research diversity.  The current project builds upon that conceptual framework to empirically test metrics that gauge the interdisciplinarity of particular bodies of research.  One proposed key measure assesses the degree to which particular research papers, or collections of such, integrate research knowledge from diverse research domains.  A second measure determines the degree of specialization of collections of research papers (e.g., those published by a particular research center or those of a research area such as quantum dots).  The resulting measures help track and characterize the emergence of new (interdisciplinary) research areas.  The project described in this proposal seeks to generate analytical algorithms for indicators of interdisciplinarity.  It also seeks to visually depict knowledge interchanges among areas of research activity.  Such science maps can help identify and characterize focused areas of research--domains--that are sources of knowledge used by other domains.  They can also show the extent of intellectual and social networking among both domains and contributing institutions.  This project will, through US-UK collaboration, develop effective means to apply and test these new metrics.  The proposed project focuses on nanoscience and nanoengineering ( nano ), an emergent research domain of considerable significance that extends well beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.  Georgia Tech has assembled a substantial nano dataset that will serve as the main testbed for computing and assessing indicator variations.  The research team will generate indicator sets and maps of selected nano sub-topics (e.g., molecular motors research).  These indicator sets and maps will be shared with researchers and R&D managers to gauge their validity and utility. Taking into account feedback, the research team will then develop a taxonomy of nanotechnology research activity based on identification of coherent research sub-areas.Broader Impacts: These tools better enable scientists, science managers, and Federal science and regulatory agencies to gauge and track cross-domain knowledge transfers.  Failure to recognize the full extent and complexity of these patterns could result in major funding and regulatory mistakes.   The new indicators and accompanying maps help identify leverage points likely to spark advances in science, technology, and innovation.  They can also facilitate graduate education by identifying convergent knowledge domains - potentially emerging  interdisciplines.   Better understanding of research landscapes can help orient graduate curricula and spotlight promising dissertation topics.  More accurate interdisciplinarity measures also contribute to an ongoing National Academies initiative to bolster interdisciplinary research across the US NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Kentucky (KY) EPSCoR RII-7 proposal unites eight institutions, University of Kentucky, Berea College, Centre College of Kentucky, Kentucky State University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University, University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University, to continue the strategy of investing in infrastructure to develop Kentucky?s ?New Economy? by supporting research in Innovative Materials and Devices.  Intellectual Merit This project will pursue two major research initiatives. Initiative in Innovative Materials and Devices is focused on studies of bulk single-crystal transition metal oxides and epitaxial thin films with complementary functionalities, and applications of multilayered thin films for molecular electrodes as well as for single-molecule magnets. The other part of the project will focus on engineering new platforms to enhance our understanding of a single cell or multiple cell types, interactions between individual cells and cell types, and sensing at the molecular, intracellular and intercellular levels. A statewide Micro/Nano Network will advance micro/nanotechnology and the many fields that utilize this technology.Broader ImpactsKentucky EPSCoR has developed a comprehensive plan for increasing diversity and evaluating progress in that area.  Programs such as seed-funding that supports research at regional institutions and a program to involve diverse populations of Kentucky students in research will be supported through EPSCoR.  A special program for computer science graduate students at Kentucky State University will be introduced.  Kentucky EPSCoR also proposes the cyberinfrastructure plans for the state, and augments them with support for increasing the expertise and developing new sources of talent. The project is consistent with the state?s science and technology plan, and the associated higher education plan.  The project will develop new facilities and establish new faculty and staff positions in the bio-, nano-, & cyber-technology areas.  Kentucky EPSCoR has developed a review process intended to identify infrastructure that should support the most promising research.  A system of evaluation metrics has been developed to determine whether a strategy is working, and if it is improving Kentucky?s competitiveness NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Channel bifurcations, wherein one channel splits into two, are the building blocks of braided, anastomosed, and distributary channel networks. Recent work has shown that the most common flow partitioning at bifurcations is asymmetric, and that this asymmetry seems to promote stability. Why and under what hydrographic and sedimentologic conditions this should be so, remain a puzzle. Here we propose an integrated field and theoretical investigation of the morphology, flow, and sedimentary processes of higher shear-stress, natural river bifurcations, with the objective of understanding and predicting their dynamical behavior. The field studies will be conducted to encompass two bifurcating systems with different sedimentation characteristics: i) distributary channel bifurcations of the Mossy Delta of the Saskatchewan River, where we have conducted pilot studies concerning bifurcation morphodynamics, and ii) bifurcations within the Wax Lake delta system, Louisiana, where active sedimentation is leading to rapid distributary channel growth. Several bifurcations at each site will be chosen to span a range of morphologic types. Bed morphology, water surface topography, flow velocity, and sediment transport rate will be measured at each bifurcation on a closely spaced grid at several flow stages. The field data will provide boundary and initial conditions for numerical experiments designed to define the processes and morphological conditions that lead to inherently unstable bifurcations, and detail the controlling boundary conditions for stability. Earlier numerical models will be improved by using Delft3D-FLOW, a morphodynamic model that accounts for: (1) three-dimensional turbulent unsteady, nonuniform flow, (2) interaction between bed topography, flow, and both bedload and suspended load, and (3) morphodynamically interacting erodible banks and bed. Numerical experiments will allow us to determine the feedback processes that promote stable bifurcations and predict which channel configurations are stable in the face of perturbations. We aim to yield a stability diagram for channel bifurcations and assess the influence of barform dynamics and downstream channel change in influencing bifurcation stability. A better understanding and predictive capability of channel bifurcation behavior would improve flood forecasting, planning and development of floodplain and channel structures, channel designs, and the success of stream restoration efforts. The results of this study also will advance our knowledge of when and where river avulsions will take. Insofar as it is transformative, it will resolve the differences among competing stability theories, and produce a model, constrained by the best-available field data, which can be used to predict the stability and behavior of these ubiquitous hydrologic and geomorphic nodes.Resulting from This Study: This work constitutes the dissertation topic and financial support for one Ph. D. candidate and will support one post-doctoral researcher. Two Native American high school students from the Cumberland House Cree Nation, Saskatchewan will be trained in its scientific methods. All students will benefit from exposure to a problem requiring the integration of geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamic modeling NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Milwaukee Mathematics Partnership (MMP) began in 2003 with the aim of improving mathematics achievement for the students in the Milwaukee Public Schools and increasing students' success in transitioning to college mathematics. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Public Schools, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College have solidified their continued commitment as core partners to this unique collaboration among a large urban district, a four-year urban university, and a two-year technical college. Student achievement has increased in most grade levels with an accompanying decrease in the gap between state and district proficiency. Evaluations indicate that building school capacity through a math framework and distributed leadership via school learning teams and math teacher leaders is associated with improved student achievement.Phase II will investigate three specific research topics. The first topic involves continued study of the impact of distributed leadership through varied mathematics teacher leader models on school professional communities and on student achievement. The MMP initiated a no-release time model of teacher leaders and is transitioning to a partial-release time model with funds from the Office of the Wisconsin Governor. A second area of research is the transition of students to post-secondary mathematics. The MMP will study the impact of a new district post-secondary mathematics readiness exam on high school course enrollments and post-secondary placements into remedial and non-remedial courses. The third area is focuses on the development of mathematical knowledge for teaching in preservice teachers, teacher leaders, and classroom teachers and will examine the relationship of this knowledge to teacher leader practice, instructional practice, and student learning NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The research objective is the theoretical and practical design and implementation of new computational data models and query languages for the trajectories (both historical and predicted) of moving objects in both constrained and unconstrained environments. One aspect is to include the modeling and querying of current and predictive movement (e.g., the prediction of the future evolution of hurricanes and wild fires) into databases. This especially introduces the inherent feature of uncertainty of moving objects, incorporates the database support of prediction models independent of applications, and includes a homogeneous and seamless integration of both historical and predictive moving objects in unconstrained environments that allow free movement. Another aspect relates to the special situation of moving objects in constrained environments, and here especially in spatial networks (like vehicles in transportation networks). The main issues here are how spatial networks as well as moving objects in them can be designed, queried, and implemented within a database system. The solution approach is based on three fundamental algebras or type systems that are embedded into database systems: (i) the Moving Balloon Algebra (MBA) for predictive moving objects in unconstraint environments, (ii) the Network Algebra (NETALG) for geometric networks in spatial databases, and (iii) the Moving Object in Network (MONET) Algebra for moving objects in spatial networks. The resuls of this research are expected to have applications in areas where dynamically evolving spatial objects -- which change their location, shape, and extent over time -- play a role. Examples are meteorology, hurricane research, fire management, disaster management, navigation systems, environmental monitoring, transportation and distribution, emergency services, telecommunications, to name only a few. The educational component of this project includes specialized classes that focus on important aspects of this project, the creation and use of new GIS educational materials, and the involvement of students in interdisciplinary research. The project Website (http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mschneid/Research/FundedResearchProjects/NSF-IIS-0812194/)is used for the dissemination of research results, educational material, publications, generated data sets, produced software, and other information of interest NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The investigators propose to develop and test new instructional techniques aimed at teaching high-school science students how to use the diagrams that appear in their biology textbooks. Research from a range of disciplines has shown that people have difficulty making sense of diagrams. The investigators had previously found that inference and other high-level processes that are important for learning from text are even more important for learning from diagrams. They further showed that students show little gains in content understanding from textbook diagrams. The investigators will capitalize on commonalities among several theories of diagrammatic reasoning to develop four interventions, following an additive design, aimed at improving classroom instruction in how to use diagrams. In each iteration, one additional intervention feature is added to the initial intervention. In the first intervention, they will teach the components of diagrams (i.e., how to read captions, color keys, and other conventions of diagrams). In the second, they will also teach the coordinating of text and diagrams. In the third, they will also have the students engage in self-explanation. In the fourth, they will also have students construct their own drawings. In conjunction with these experimental studies, the investigators will collect eye tracking data on a subset of participants pre- and post-intervention in order to look for possible changes in gaze patterns NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Center for the Study of Black Youth in Context (CSBYC) will focus on research and action on social, psychological, and educational development among African American children and youth.  The CSBYC has four major objectives: (1) to develop an infrastructure for a series of coordinated research investigations of the ecological, cultural, racial, and familial contexts that influence the development of African American children; (2) to provide training for early scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students around skills necessary to do research and practice with diverse populations of ethnic minority children in diverse community and school settings; (3) to cultivate collaborative relationships and partnerships between the University of Michigan and local communities to inform current and prospective practice and  intervention approaches for improving youth social and educational outcomes; (4) to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for scholarship, training, and practice approaches that can be utilized by scholarly and community stakeholders in the state more broadly, as well as among institutional and community settings nationally.  To meet these goals, CSBYC investigators will conduct an initial research study of middle school aged children in four diverse community settings. The goals of the research project are to study ways parents and family caregivers socialize their children around race and to examine the influence of various types of parenting on child academic and social outcomes. Using multiple methods (surveys, family diary studies, qualitative interviews, and observations), the research will show how parents choose parenting strategies based on characteristics of their communities (e.g., racial and economic diversity) along with their appraisals of the racial, cultural, and class dynamics of their communities. The CSBYC research will contribute to understanding of normative development of African American children within their varying family, neighborhood, and school contexts, which has received relatively little systematic attention. The study of Black youth from different social class backgrounds is important for a number of reasons.  First, despite the growing Black middle class in America, a disproportionate number of studies have focused only on low-income Black children in urban settings and/or on high-risk youth populations. Consequently, race and social class often are confounded in research and in its application to practices/interventions to enhance youth development.  There is less knowledge of family, educational, and social development processes of African American children across different social class groups and the implications of community social class and demographic diversity, such as Black families' movement to, and increasing representation in, middle class or suburban settings. For instance, studies show that parental education is one of the biggest predictors of school achievement among African American youth, yet even middle class African American students trail their European American counterparts in academic achievement. Such patterns suggest that parents of different social class backgrounds differentially negotiate the schooling process for their children. It also suggests there still is much to be learned about variation in family processes within lower and higher socioeconomic levels. By examining Black families from diverse community contexts, the CSBYC investigators will address important questions about the nature of development among Black youth in ways that can support the efforts of researchers, communities, schools, and families to encourage successful development among children and adolescents NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Undergraduate Training in Theoretical Ecology Research (UTTER) program at the University of Texas at Arlington provides an integrated research and education experience for cohorts of undergraduates in biology and mathematics. Five cohorts of eight students each pursue a two-year program of mentoring, seminars, interdisciplinary research, and specially designed coursework in mathematical biology, with each component and new course being jointly developed and coordinated by six faculty members from biology and mathematics with experience in interdisciplinary research and education. UTTER's four primary goals are: (1) to recruit talented students from historically underrepresented groups to complete interdisciplinary training in mathematical biology; (2) to develop curriculum and infrastructure for this training through new courses and formalized interactions between faculty and students from the two departments; (3) to involve participating students in interdisciplinary research through structured and mentored long-term experiences within and across cohorts; and (4) to facilitate participant transitions into graduate studies and other interdisciplinary careers following program completion and graduation. The intellectual merit of the project lies in: (1) the integration of mathematics and biology into each of the research projects, and how each of the projects helps students develop specific skills;  (2) the continued development of an interdisciplinary curricular framework to support students as they pursue their research and to encourage the development of an on-going community of students interested in theoretical ecology; and (3) the strength of the research projects which are all significant, conceptually interesting and timely, and which all fit well under the general theme of theoretical ecology. The project's broader impacts include: (1) its focus on the recruitment and support of students from underrepresented groups, particularly through a recruitment plan targeting local community colleges; (2) the development of three new interdisciplinary courses that involve many students other than those directly participating in the project and foster a culture of interdisciplinary cooperation among faculty; and (3) the development of new models of effective interdisciplinary undergraduate training in mathematical biology as well other academic areas NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Cumulative Learning using Embedded Assessment Results (CLEAR) focuses on the challenge of using assessment of relevant STEM content to improve K-12 teaching and learning. CLEAR takes advantage of new technologies and research findings to investigate ways that science assessments can both capture and contribute to cumulative, integrated learning of standards-based concepts in middle school courses. The project will research new forms of assessment that document students' accumulation of knowledge and also serve as learning events. CLEAR will use cohort and randomized classroom comparisons to determine what combinations of instruction and assessment enable middle school students to gain cumulative understanding of energy concepts in science. CLEAR will study whether the project's approach when used in one course impacts progress in the next. The project will put design principles from across the field to the test by determining which instruction and assessment strategies encourage cumulative understanding and help learners develop integrated ideas about science.Intellectual Merit. There is an urgent need to develop accurate student assessments that measure cumulative knowledge while eliminating the disruptions caused by tests. By measuring students' developing understanding and ongoing efforts to make sense of new materials, the project will be able to foster coherent understanding. The project will do this by making assessment an integral part of computer-based curricula.Broader Impacts. By aligning assessment and instruction around the goal of promoting understanding, the project will demonstrate how to improve learning outcomes for any STEM course. The project will also make courses more effective and efficient by converting assessment from a time-wasting, curriculum-limiting chore into an integral part of learning that fosters the accumulation of concepts across topics and grades. The results of the proposed research will have an important bearing on the design of effective electronic media on promoting student learnig.   The project is designed to have a major impact by undertaking the kind of careful, statistically valid research design that leads to reproducible results that can support policy. The project will be able to tailor instruction to specific learners, increasing the impact on students at risk for failure. The partners will continue their practice of widely dissemi-nating findings, materials, and open source software through reviewed papers, popular articles, talks, workshops, a website, and newsletters. The project is led by Marcia C. Linn, Robert Tinker, Kathy Benemann, Hee Sun Lee, Ou Lydia Liu, & James Slotta NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER California State University at San Marcos, Rochester Institute of Technology, San Diego County Office of Education, San Diego Science Alliance, K-12 High Speed Network, California State Parks, and eight southern California middle schools are collaborating to develop, implement, and evaluate teacher professional development and student learning experiences to enhance science and information and communication technologies (ICT) learning among underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students (primarily Hispanic and Native American) in grades 7 and 8. The major goal of the project is to promote workforce diversity by working with focal students to ensure their readiness for, and interest and participation in, ICT-intensive careers. Major project activities include (1) developing ICT-enhanced STEM learning modules and resources for use in middle school physics, chemistry, and life science coruses, (2) preparing 32 ICT-savvy teachers from target schools in five school districts, and (3) providing students with ICT-intensive summer camps. The curriculum component addresses grade-appropriate science and technology standards by developing classroom-based science investigation modules that employ ICT technologies such as videoconferencing, interactive games, probeware, visualizations, web resources, and social networking tools (Moodle). Thirty-two teachers are receiving professional development for two or three years by attending Summer Academies and engaging in year-long activities that include Lesson Study and action research. Project staff, scientists, and computer science graduate students are providing ongoing classroom support. Project teachers will impact an estimated 10,000 students. An additional 100 teachers in the region will be exposed to project resources through workshops conducted by project teachers, reaching another 15,000 students. The evaluation/research plan is using a quasi-experimental study to investigate how participation in the project impacts students' course selection in high school and career interests, and how teachers implement project materials and change classroom practices NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Government policy today targets firms rather than firm ecosystems.  Given the increased fragmentation of firm activities and increased technological interdependency of these firms over the past 20 years, this mode of policy-making may be outdated.  This research leverages a natural experiment in the converging telecommunications and computing industry to examine the impact on the innovation ecosystem of removing a critical set of innovating firms. Drawing on the results, the researchers seek to define characteristics of innovation ecosystems that could provide resiliency against future shocks.Despite extensive study, there is little agreement within the academic, industrial, or policy communities on the impact of moving firm activities offshore on innovation back in the U.S.  Previous work by the P.I. has shown that moving manufacturing offshore changes technology development incentives.  Specifically, her results show that when U.S. firms shift production from the U.S. to developing East Asia, the most advanced technologies that were developed in the U.S. no longer pay.  Production characteristics are different abroad, and earlier technologies can be more cost-effective in developing country environment.  Building on these results, this project seeks to understand the impact of manufacturing offshore on (1) the innovative activities of the firms that moved manufacturing offshore, and (2) the continued advance of the advanced technologies within the same or other institutions in the U.S. In the case of the first part of the study, the results demonstrate whether firms which relocated manufacturing offshore are following a different technology trajectory from those firms still manufacturing in the U.S.  In the case of the second part of the study, the results shed insight into whether the relocation of manufacturing offshore has, in the case of the ecosystem of study, shifted the institutional locus of innovation. Broader Impact: In recent years, there has been rising concern over the ability of the U.S. to remain competitive in the global economy. Understanding how innovation ecosystems react to a set of innovating firms moving activities offshore is critical to redefining U.S. science and innovation policy and to improving the resiliency of such systems. The results of this study shed insights into the significance of institutional location -- small versus large firms, universities, or government labs -- on the quantity and direction of innovation.  Leveraging these results, the project characterizes critical metrics of innovation ecosystems that may aid in their resiliency against shocks such as a large set of innovating firms moving manufacturing offshore.  Metrics may include such units as coupling intensity between manufacturing location and innovative output, institutional fluidity, firm-university patent-publication interdependency, and other metrics that emerge from the result of the study.  These metrics can be used immediately by policy-makers to assess ecosystem resiliency, and will enable academics to build on them in future work characterizing industry ecosystems. Finally, the particular technology of study -- optoelectronics -- is critical to advance in communications, computing, and sensing.  Understanding the policy levers to continue technology development in optoelectronics may be essential to U.S. economic and military leadership NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Institution: American Association for the Advancement of ScienceTitle:  Interdisciplinary Scientific Conference in South Africa to support the South African Ph.D. ProjectRef.: Vaughan C. TurekianHRD 0850461With National Science Foundation support, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will support the National Research Foundation?s (NRF) South African Ph.D. Project by serving as a key collaborator in planning an interdisciplinary science and engineering capacity building conference in South Africa for the NRF?s Ph.D. students worldwide.  The conference will provide opportunities to forge relationships between South African scientists and students, their counterparts at NSF CREST institutions in the U.S. and other members of the larger science communities in the U.S. and beyond.  This NSF award will enable AAAS to support the intellectual development of the conference and travel by U.S.-based scientists and students to the meeting in South Africa.  AAAS will serve a key collaborator in planning the scientific conference, developing the framework for the meeting, and through an advisory role, helping to build long term capacity to organize and conduct such meeting ? conveying best practices in the organization and execution of an interdisciplinary scientific conference and providing adaptable templates for conference materials.Intellectual MeritThe proposed conference will provide significant educational and professional development experiences for the participating students from South Africa and the United States while providing in-person contact between U.S. and South African scientists that could facilitate future scientific collaborations among and between the participating scientists.Broader ImpactsThe proposed conference should significantly enhance the educational and professional development of the participating U.S. and South African students as well as facilitate the development of both institutional and faculty research collaborations between the participating U.S. and South African institutions and scientists NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SES-0818337Meredith Kleykamp   University of KansasThe project will measure whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential attitudes toward military veterans and whether this affects veteran treatment in the hiring process. This study explores how and why veteran outcomes differ by race/ethnicity and gender. The main goals of the project are to: 1) identify how military veterans fare in hiring, document the extent of differential hiring treatment of veterans and whether such treatment varies by race and gender using an experimental design 2) explore the mechanisms explaining employer  treatment of veterans, how employers evaluate military experience, and what meaning military experience holds in the civilian hiring process using in-depth interviews with hiring agents and 3) adjudicate competing sociological explanations for differential veteran/nonveteran employment outcomes, of human capital development, selection, signaling or screening, and cultural capital development on the basis of the audit and interview data.  Broader ImpactsThe research has broad reaching social impacts.  First, it contributes to both the academic and practical understanding of veteran hiring practices. Findings will foster development of veteran-friendly transition and employment policies.  Evidence of discriminatory hiring practices or negative sentiments toward military job seekers would suggest the need for better employer education on laws protecting military members and better evaluation of compliance with such laws.  On the other hand, evidence of preferential treatment could clarify that employment transition difficulties facing veterans lie elsewhere in the hiring or job matching process.   The project contributes to the recent University of Kansas-Ft. Leavenworth initiative facilitating collaboration between the University and the Army?s Command and General Staff College by providing information that can be used to aid military policymaking NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER X-Ray Flares: The Last Breath of the Inner Engine Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) explosions occur approximately three times per day in the visible universe (not considering the beaming correction) and have been observed routinely by highly successful dedicated mis NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DETERMINATION OF THE BONE MARROW MACROPHAGE PHENOTYPE IN SPACE Summary:  THE EXPERIMENTS PROPOSED BY THE PI FOR THE ULF2 MISSION DEFINITELY IS ALIGNED WITH NASA'S MISSION.  IN FACT THE EXPERIMENT PROPOSED BY THE PI FOR ULF2 MISSION ADDRESSES TWO QUESTIONS NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Immigration is a major area of concern shaping contemporary policy, practice and debate in the United States. As a large scale agent of change, shifts in policy and perceptions concerning immigrants ripple through social networks, affecting household arrangements and resources that impact not only individuals, but families and whole communities. These impacts are felt by immigrants, naturalized citizens and natives who share the same communities, households and families. Recent research suggests that social networks among the urban poor can be eroded by macro-level economic and political uncertainty and instability, but comparatively little is known about how this process unfolds. Clear scientific evidence demonstrating how people are affected by such policy shifts can provide evidence for developing immigration-related policy and practice with fewer negative unintended consequences. With backgrounds in sociology, anthropology, human biology, geography and demography, the project team examined Latino households with at least one Spanish-speaking adult in south Phoenix, Arizona. Households were recruited by partnering with Latino community educators who are well-established in the area. Field interviews were conducted by bilingual students at Arizona State University. Using a range of tools and methods, including social network analysis and mathematical modeling, researchers determined if and how the households reorganized in response to changing immigration policy and practice. The study examined the social networks that link household members to each other and larger networks, and model the implications of this for the resource flows to household members and ultimately for household resiliency and the well-being of family members. Agent-based models were then applied to examine the potential impact of future large-scale shifts in immigration perceptions and policies.By focusing on the mechanism of social networks?as the framework in which decisions concerning resource flows are made, played out, and constrained?the study empirically ties well-being of household members to social policy shifts outside the household in new and more explicit ways. The project?s unique approach to data construction makes it possible to clarify the potential for changes in immigration enforcement or employer sanction laws to impact individuals who may or may not be directly targeted by these policies. At the local level, the data, findings, and related outreach activities will contribute to the development of research capacities within the target community and raise public awareness. Research findings, such as determining which factors enhance household stability and how social networks can be leveraged to move limited resources where they are most needed, were shared with local stakeholders to support their goals of building healthy communities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THE CENTER FOR RADIATION ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE FOR SPACE EXPLORATION (CRESSE) Prairie View A&M University (PVAMU) - a HBCU - proposes a research center with the infrastructure to investigate the scientific and engineering challenges faced by NASA and th NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ENHANCING THE USE OF NASA EARTH SCIENCE RESULTS / DATA / AND TECHNOLOGY BY ENGAGING THE FEDERATION OF EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATION PARTNERS COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN TARGET AREAS OF INTEREST TO NASA The Federation of Earth Science Information Partners ( Fed NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER It is important to understand how people in our society, including our leaders and people in mission-critical positions, make decisions in various stressful contexts.  A major area of research in cognitive psychology describes how people make decisions as a process of information accumulation over time.  These theories state that people make better (more accurate) choices if they have enough time to accumulate relevant evidence. A strength of the information accumulation theories is that they explain why speedy responding, perhaps under stress, is often erroneous responding.  Much experimental evidence supports the information accumulation theories.   However, this evidence comes from experimental tasks embedded within a larger experimental context, a context that includes temporal constraints such as when the different components of the task are presented and when decisions are required.  That is, psychology experiments (and many real-world decision problems) have a rhythm within which decision problems are framed and solved, and this rhythm also exerts an influence on decision performance.  The importance of task rhythm is underscored by another theoretical perspective which emphasizes the dynamic aspects of the choice environment.  In this perspective, attention is viewed as a dynamic process attuned to the underlying task rhythm, and understanding how the pace of the environment interacts with how effectively people focus attention is critical for understanding the decision-making process.  This proposal offers an integrated theory  that formally combines the information accumulation and dynamic attending approaches.  The proposed experiments test predictions of the hybrid model with regard to effects of task difficulty, pacing and rhythm, and the role of instructions and feedback.  This research is significant because it links choice behaviors to contextual factors that shape people's attention, thus allowing them to  tune in  to relevant information more or less effectively.  It will improve our understanding of choice performance of healthy individuals who must render sometimes critical decisions under time stress, and also, eventually, choice performance of individuals who suffer from a variety of attentional dysfunctions (e.g., attention deficit disorders, autism, etc NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Vision is the dominant sensory modality that people use to interact with the external environment and to learn about it. There is behavioral evidence that even relatively short periods of training with action video games can improve performance on some kinds of visual abilities, especially those that allow people to analyze spatial relationships among objects in the environment. For example, after action video game training, people are able to keep track of more objects moving around in the visual world than they could before. This exploratory research addresses three gaps in current understanding. First, the full range of visual abilities that can be improved by action video game training remains unknown. Second, it is not known whether such training could improve learning speed itself during visual tasks, such as those that involve predicting sequences of spatial locations. Third, little is known about the brain changes that enable such improvements. The proposed research will measure performance and brain activation in a group of participants (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) on a battery of visual tasks before and after a two-week action video game training period. The pattern of performance and brain activation changes will reveal the specific visual and learning abilities and brain networks that are modified by video game training.The proposed study will provide preliminary data potentially leading to training-based applications that are important for society. Specifically, the visuospatial abilities that can be improved after action video game practice are used in a broad range of professions. For instance, mathematicians, engineers, architects and many other individuals routinely engaged in tasks that require performing complex mental spatial transformations may benefit from action video game training. This research may be eventually lead to developing effective training video games that maximally take advantage of adult brain plasticity. Information about the precise neural bases of these processes may also lead to innovative educational practices that enhance learning abilities themselves, help people with visuospatial learning disabilities, as in attention deficit disorder, or even to future pharmacological methods to improve performance NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.  Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone. The project also continues the PIs' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Automatic, unconscious processes are frequently assumed to be responsible for the systematic patterns of apparently irrational behavior documented by cognitive psychologists.  However, some recent experiments suggest that deliberate conscious thought actually lead to poorer decisions in complex choice situations.  The purpose of this research is to understand what conditions result in automatic / deliberative decision making resulting in superior performance and the sources of these performance advantages.Two sets of experiments will investigate these questions from two opposite directions.  Several studies will examine recent experimental evidence for the efficacy of  unconscious thought  processes.  These experiments ask: (1) is the apparent unconscious thought advantage found in these recent experiments normatively and psychologically real?  And, if so, (2) what are the cognitive mechanisms underlying this unconscious thought advantage; and (3) does this advantage extend to choice situations involving inter-temporal trade-offs and moral dimensions?A second set of experiments starts with biases observed in conscious judgment, and asks whether similar biases in information processing influence the automatic processes engaged by subliminal images.  When participants are exposed to masked images, presented so briefly that they fail to reach conscious awareness, these images nonetheless can  prime  - i.e., facilitate or interfere with - responses to subsequent clearly visible images.  By modifying the content of the subliminal images and the structure of the task, it is possible to ask whether factors that inappropriately bias explicit conscious judgments have similar effects on implicit unconscious priming from subliminal images.This research promises to deepen our understanding of the functions of consciousness, the mechanisms of intuition, and the general relationship between consciousness and rationality.  It should help us to better understand the conditions under which, and the mechanisms by which, conscious and unconscious thought processes lead to improved decisions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER As team members gain experience working together, team performance improves significantly. These  learning curves  have been observed in many team settings, including software development teams, hospital surgery teams and coal-mining crews.  This research project will examine constituents of team experience in order to learn more about the specific phenomena that underlie learning curve gains. Researchers have attributed some of the performance gains associated with team longevity to the development of  transactive memory  (TM) systems, which involve awareness of who knows and does what on a team. When a team has a well-defined TMS, team members know whom to rely on for specific skills or expertise. A series of laboratory studies will manipulate the match between team members' knowledge and roles and the extent to which team members share a common language. The experiments will examine the separate and interactive effects of these variables on team performance as well as the nature of the task (e.g., its uncertainty, urgency), characteristics of team members (e.g., member diversity), and features of the work context (e.g., whether team performance occurs in a virtual or co-located setting) in order to identify which component of transactive memory (or which interactions) increases team performance.  This research has theoretical and practical implications. Due to the rapid organizational and technological changes prevalent in today's workplace, teams often do not not have the luxury of staying together for extended periods.  By unpacking the constituents of learning curve effects we learn how to promote these effects more quickly. Conversely, we can learn to recognize the conditions in which there can be no substitute for time NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project remedies one of the greatest impediments to rapid progress in the science of science and innovation policy (SciSIP) both as a field of study and as a guide to policy: the lack of an integrated database which can trace the links from government investment in R&D through the path of knowledge creation, its transmission and codification, and ultimately in many cases to commercial uses yielding a better standard of living and better jobs. Specifically, the project completes, validates, demonstrates the utility of, and makes available to the research community the Science & Technology Agents of Revolution (STAR) Database which is a transformative platform technology for analyses in whole or part of the creation, transmission, and use of new scientific and engineering knowledge, the creation of new commercial technologies in pre-existing and/or new firms, and the success of those firms as engines of wealth creation and employment growth. The STAR database integrates and complements key databases on science and innovation by a system of unique IDs for firms and other organizations and for individual scientists and engineers as they appear as principal investigators, authors, dissertation writers or advisors, inventors, and/or firm officers, directors, and key employees. Especially the most productive of these scientists ? the ?star innovators? ? wear many hats simultaneously. The STAR database integrates data on government grants, journal articles, dissertations, patents, venture capital, initial public offerings, and other firm data. It links to major public databases via widely used financial market identifiers. In collaboration with the Census Bureau, the STAR and the Census firm and worker databases are linked by a concordance for use by researchers with access to the Census data. The STAR database will have three tiers: a public graphics-based site primarily oriented toward policymakers and the media, a public site providing access to researchers for downloads and database queries limited to the public constituent databases or aggregates derived from the licensed commercial databases, and on-site access at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) providing researchers access to the complete STAR Database for building take-away analysis datasets.Broader Impacts: This project is designed specifically for broader impact. It will provide a shared database that will advance discovery, and enable research otherwise impossibly expensive for nearly any dissertation student or faculty member not located at one of the few elite institutions where significant parts of the STAR Database are available. Real data will bring excitement to classroom assignments on topics that in the abstract can deaden students' interest. Most of the data are available on-line with the commercially licensed part of the data available for building take-away analysis data sets at the NBER and for use within all the Census Bureau?s Research Data Centers. These data enable both academic and government researchers to build reliable and tested answers to fundamental administration and Congressional questions about the variety of returns to government investments in research. Zucker and Darby pursue an active outreach program to get their results to policymakers and the press in a form that they can use NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PI: Ghovanloo, MaysamProposal Number: 0828882Problem Statement: The number of people with disabilities is increasing among all age groups, especially the elderly (+65) who currently comprise 12% of the U.S. population. Individuals severely disabled as a result of various causes from spinal cord injuries to stroke, cerebral palsy, and ALS find it extremely difficult to carry out everyday tasks without continuous help. Despite the wide variety of assistive technologies (AT) available for individuals with lower levels of disabilities, the above population is still considered underserved, and would greatly benefit from having more choices, particularly in utilizing adaptable ATs that can take advantage of whatever remaining capabilities that they might have. We intend to help individuals with little or no upper extremity functions to improve their quality of life by enabling them to control their environment, drive their powered wheelchair (PWC), and access computers by simply moving their tongue. Intellectual Merits: The main purpose of the proposed research is to develop an unobtrusive, minimally invasive, low cost, and wireless AT called the 'Tongue Drive' system (TDS), which can potentially substitute some of the arm and hand functions in people with quadriplegia. Conceptually, the TDS consists of an array of small magnetic sensors located inside the mouth, on an orthodontic brace (internal version - iTDS), or outside of the mouth, mounted on a headset (external version - eTDS). The sensor array measures the magnetic field of a small permanent magnet, the size of a grain of rice, which is attached to the tongue by means of tissue adhesives, implantation, piercing, or clipping. The sensor signals are transmitted wirelessly to an external ultra-portable PC, which is worn by the user. The received data is processed to determine the coordinates, orientation, and relative motion of the magnet with respect to the array of sensors in real time. This information is then used to control the movements of a cursor on the PC screen, and to perform all other functions that can be done with a mouse pointer or a joystick. The principal advantage of the TDS is that a few magnetic sensors and an inherently wireless permanent magnet could potentially capture an unlimited number of tongue movements, each of which can represent a specific user command. A set of dedicated tongue movements could be tailored for each individual user based on his/her preferences, lifestyle, and remaining abilities, and mapped onto a set of customized functions for computer, PWC, and environmental access. Thus, TDS can offer a high degree of adaptability and cover a large group of users with different levels of disabilities. In addition, the TDS has the potential to provide its users with proportional control, which makes it a lot easier to maneuver PWCs in crowded and confined spaces. This research also involves a thorough evaluation of the TDS efficacy, usability and user acceptability.Broader Impacts: We intend to help the most severely disabled individuals to live active, selfsupportive, satisfying, and productive lives, equal to the other members of the society. Paralysis is considered to be one of the most expensive types of disabilities. Solutions such as the TDS could help reduce healthcare and assisted-living costs, increase the employability of people with disabilities, and allow users to participate more fully in the society, while relieving their family members or dedicated caregivers.Educational Plan: The PI's main educational objective is to stimulate the interests of undergraduate and graduate students by taking advantage of the 'multidisciplinary' nature of the proposed research. Undergraduates will be recruited through senior design and presidential undergraduate research award (PURA) to participate in development of the TDS graphical userinterface. A graduate student will also be involved in the proposed research by developing the TDS hardware and sensor signal processing algorithms as well as helping with human trials NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures (QSPINS).  The MRSEC's research is centered on studies of new magnetic materials and structures at the nanometer scale, with the aim of developing fundamental understanding of their properties and related phenomena important for advanced technological applications.  QSPINS is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). IRG1 'Nanoscale Magnetism: Structures, Materials and Phenomena' focuses on fundamental physics, chemistry, and materials issues in nanoscale magnets, addressing important quantum, electronic structure, nanofabrication, high-sensitivity measurements, and magnetization-dynamics problems.  Nanostructuring has reached a length scale where quantum approaches are needed, and this IRG brings a unique combination of theory, modeling, and new fabrication and measurement methods to the study of novel materials and phenomena.  The expected outcomes are new insights into phenomena and structures important for the development of novel cluster-assembled materials, higher energy-density permanent magnets, and information-technology materials. IRG2 'Magnetoelectric Interfaces and Spin Transport' employs the electron spin in a synergistic combination with novel nanoscale magnetic and ferroelectric structures to manipulate spin-dependent properties to yield new scientific concepts and achieve enhanced functionalities. Designed magnetoelectric and piezomagnetic heterostructures are to be investigated where the interplay between electricity, elasticity, and magnetism across interfaces manifests interesting unexplored phenomena, such as electrically-controlled exchange bias and magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and ferroelectrically-tailored spin transport. QSPINS's education and outreach programs encourage gifted young people to pursue scientific careers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through targeted programs, and improve materials literacy among the general public.  As an integral part of the Center, QSPINS offers interdisciplinary training for the next generation of materials scientists and engineers by providing regional four-year institutions experience and tools to improve their materials science programs and curricula, offering opportunities for middle- and high-school teachers and their students to learn about materials science, and by addressing pre-college segments of the educational pipeline via targeted outreach activities.  QSPINS maintains shared experimental and computational facilities and supports exploratory Seed Projects to provide continual revitalization of the projects and investigators and promote new interdisciplinary collaborations. QSPINS fosters interactions with industrial companies to leverage the expected scientific innovations for potential technological advances NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PI: David Hannapel (Iowa State University)CoPIs: Aragula G. Rao (Iowa State University), Jeff Coller (Case Western Reserve University), William J. Lucas (University of California, Davis)Plants perceive outside signals that activate pathways to control their defenses and growth. The length of daylight or photoperiod is a key signal that regulates growth processes like flowering in many plants and tuber formation in potato. Tuber formation in potato involves the transport of a light-activated signal from the leaf to the underground organ, the potato tuber. The overall scientific objective of this project is to study the range of signals that are responsible for controlling tuber formation. Signals involved in this process include both proteins and RNA. Two research goals will be addressed in this project: 1) To identify and characterize RNAs of potato that are transported from the leaf to the underground tuber and 2) To identify proteins that work with the RNAs to facilitate this transport. Several approaches will be undertaken to implement these research goals, including the systematic characterization of the network of RNAs and proteins present in this transport system. Proteins and RNAs will be identified and tested for their function in this signaling system. The primary goal of this project is to understand how this collection of signals regulates tuber formation. The utility of this research activity is that the information generated by these experiments will have direct applications for enhancing crop productivity. The broader scientific impacts resulting from this research activity are inherent in the enhancement of our understanding of how plants use light signals to control their growth and, for agronomic crops, to affect their yield. A significant component of this project is the educational and outreach features. The educational component will be implemented through the Summer Internship program that will provide high school and undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in plant biology projects. As a component of outreach training, summer internships for high school biology teachers will also be offered. These teachers will work with project leaders on the Iowa State, UC-Davis, or Case Western Reserve campuses to learn more about plant biology. By targeting high school teachers who may teach up to 100 students a year, the influence of this program will be greatly expanded and will fulfill a primary mission of NSF; to communicate to society the significance of the outcomes of current research in plant biology. The international component of this project will expand the breadth of training available through this initiative and enhance global awareness of the scientific challenges addressed in this research. This project includes ample opportunities for participation by women and underrepresented groups in laboratory research. Project outcomes will be made available to the scientific community through a project website, which will be accessible via http://www.hort.iastate.edu/research/research-detail.php?id=1148 NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Recent years have seen important progress in the understanding of twodimensional statistical physics. The rigorous study of macroscopicrandom geometric structures generated by microscopic random inputs andinteractions has been greatly stimulated by the introduction ofSchramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE) and related objects. This enabled toestablish results predicted by Conformal Field Theory (CFT) in TheoreticalPhysics, most often without matching the techniques. The P.I.'s research programis primarily directed at realizing CFT concepts from SLE basedconstructions. The methods and issues involve an interplay ofgeometric, functional analytic and representation theoretic aspects.The goal of this proposal is to analyze mathematical models of thephysical phenomenon of phase transition. A phase transition describes a sharpqualitative change in a physical system under variation of an externalparamater, such as freezing of water (transition from liquid tosolid phase as temperature decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic geometrymay emerge, akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non mixing fluidslike oil and water. The study of those fluctuating interfaces isrooted in both Probability Theory and Theoretical Physics. Special focuswill be placed on the interaction between these two approaches, andother areas of mathematics involved in the analysis NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project proposes a conference to stimulate a national conversation on new STEM learning research paradigms that cut across boundaries and investigate multiple contexts and media, rather than historical approaches that have viewed learning within limited temporal, spatial and socio-cultural contexts.The project will create a special peer-reviewed, international themed issue in the journal Science Education that reflects the meeting, convene the national conference of prominent learning sciences researchers, host a post-conference national web conference, follow-up on participants after one year, and host a series of national discussions around new paradigms in STEM at multiple national meetings NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Despite evidence that innovation has become increasingly collaborative, our understanding of collaborative creativity and its impact on economic productivity remains incomplete.  For example, how should firms structure the collaborations of their inventors, given that networks which enhance the generation of a new idea also appear to hamper the dissemination of that idea?  How does knowledge flow within and between regions and how can policy makers influence those flows for maximal social welfare?  How does investment in scientific research result in peer-reviewed publication, the diffusion of knowledge, invention, and patenting, and ultimate gains in economic productivity?  These questions remain unanswered because social network data are difficult to gather, particularly across time, space, and boundaries.  This proposal allows answering these questions by calculating and posting millions of relational data, based on all co-authorship ties between inventors of U.S. patents, from 1963 through the present.The database complements the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) patent database by providing the social networks of patent co-authorships.  It creates a standard social network patent database at the individual inventor and aggregate levels including organizational, regional, and technological.  It reduces barriers to entry to scholars who lack the requisite programming skills and hardware to create the data on their own and enables real time graphing of patent co-authorship networks.  It provides a website by which actual inventors can assess the accuracy of the algorithms used to uniquely identify them in the patent database.  Finally, the project provides data on a public website accessible by scholars, business analysts, and students.  Just as the original NBER database has unleashed broad and diverse scholarship on innovation (over 500 papers cite it, according to Google Scholar, by early 2008), the social network database project will unleash a similar wave of research, focused on collaborative creativity and the social networks of inventors and their organizations.Broader Impacts: The research will publish social network data from all U.S. patent co-authorships (1963-present) for use by researchers, students, and business analysts.  It will provide real-time ability to visually illustrate these networks, with a variety of variables illustrated by color and size of the nodes and co-authorship links.  It will enable answering how managers should structure collaborative relationships and how information flows across organizational, regional, and technological boundaries.  It will enable tracing the career productivity and mobility of millions of inventors around the world.  In conjunction with other databases on research grants and scientific publication, it will illuminate the process of knowledge creation and dissemination at many levels of analysis, from the individual, to the organizational, and international.The primary purpose of this project is to make social network data, based on the co-authorship of U.S. patents from 1963 through the present, available to researchers and the public at large.  The plan, within six months of project start, is to make the data available from the Harvard MIT Data Center.  The data will also be archived in the Henry A. Murray Research Archive.

More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options, such as scale and multiply, on the dancers' creative expression and improvisation. A formal notation, called a creativity graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of the dancers' movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases, when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a new association between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersive environment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpected performance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on our understanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments and computing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as a computational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3D tele-immersive spaces NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is a three-year partnership between the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC) and two discipline-based organizations, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC/PTEC, an effort of the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers) and the American Chemical Society.  The project vision is the creation of a large and enduring national network of colleges and universities that have successfully negotiated difficult institutional constraints to establish strong, effective, and well-sustained high school teacher preparation programs in science and mathematics - programs that respond successfully to the need for accomplished science and mathematics teachers in their states and throughout the country.  Core objectives of the work are to:      a.  Create and support a national leadership network from up to 50 institutions of presidents, chancellors, provosts and their designees who are active at their institutions in improving mathematics and science education - and especially teacher education;     b.  Increase the number of disciplinary faculty who are contributing toward teacher preparation and who, through inter-departmental, inter-college and school-university partnerships, assume increased responsibility for the mentoring and induction of beginning teachers and the professional development of career teachers;     c.  Address and make demonstrable progress toward overcoming the challenges that impede the ability of universities to strengthen their science teacher preparation programs;      d.  Widely disseminate the results and lessons learned from this and other related projects, especially the lessons learned about: (1) changes in institutional policies and practices that enhance science teacher preparation programs and increase the participation of disciplinary faculty; (2) the programmatic features of exemplary science teacher preparation programs, (3) the features of successful Noyce Scholarship Programs; (4) securing the ongoing and active commitment of top institutional leadership to making teacher preparation - particularly in science and mathematics - a central university enterprise; (5) the role of the disciplinary societies in strengthening science teacher preparation and in the support of practicing teachers; and (6) state policy efforts that can facilitate improvement of science teacher preparation and that remove the disincentive for pursuing a career in teaching; and     e.

It is usually impossible to conduct a true experiment with random assignment of students to educational opportunities.  However, large-scale shifts in policy can serve as  natural experiments  that change the way students are matched to educational programs and allow us to identify causal consequences of education.The specific research question addressed by this project is:  Do institution-level shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred lead to measurable changes in graduate outcomes?for example: higher earnings, increased participation in the science and engineering workforce, or a larger probability of filing patents?relative to similar earlier graduates? And how does the research inform the science of science policy?Writing in 1994, William Trent and John Hill described a concerted effort by a group of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to expand educational opportunities in engineering, computer science and other technical fields,  to prepare their students for expanded career choices.   Preliminary evidence suggests that a shift in the relative participation of black college graduates in occupations related to engineering, math, computer science, or physical sciences (EMS) occurred at about the same time.  Furthermore, growth in EMS college majors was particularly strong among students most likely to attend HBCUs:  those who attended high school in the South.  The initial phase of this project is designed to distinguish whether the growth was driven by HBCU policies, or by change at other southern institutions.  The second phase involves assembling more than 30 years of data on the number and type of degrees conferred by each U.S. institution of higher education (collected annually by the U.S. Department of Education), analyzing the data to find other examples of large institution-level (or state-level) shifts in the number of science and engineering degrees conferred, and combining this information with data from other sources to discover the resulting educational and economic impacts.The initial phase of this research is designed to reveal the institution-level processes underlying recent expansion of science and engineering participation by a persistently underrepresented minority group.  More generally, the research project expands knowledge about the extent to which exposure to science or engineering education at the undergraduate level changes the set of skills college graduates bring to the labor market, and whether that change is substantial enough to affect a whole host of outcome measures including earnings, occupation, and patent activity. Broader ImpactsThe knowledge gained from this research project informs individual-level career-path choices as well as educational and workforce policies.

One of these important primary producers, marine cyanobacteria, have similarly been shown to be affected, positively and negatively, by copper (natural and anthropogenic) levels and may also be influenced by cobalt and nickel levels. At the same time, cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton are changing the distributions of metals and their reactivity through uptake, which causes measurable depletion of metals in surface waters, and through the extra-cellular production of metal binding ligands. Because of the importance of copper in aquatic environments, the PIs will characterize copper metabolism in marine cyanobacteria using model Synechococcus strains from oligotrophic environments and from coastal environments that have very different metal physiologies revealed by the whole genome sequencing projects. They will characterize how the strains respond to different copper levels using whole genome microarrays that probe the global response of the cell and will combine these studies with state of the art characterization of intracellular metal levels and other measures of cellular physiology and photosynthetic capacity. Molecular genetics studies of diverse copper associated genes will be undertaken to determine their function in the cell. Preliminary results have found a potential candidate for an intracellular copper binding protein that is conserved in all marine cyanobacteria. At the same time, preliminary results have found that coastal cyanobacteria have greater resistance to copper than open ocean species and this might be due to a novel copper binding or efflux system. The PIs will illustrate the importance of copper in aquatic environments by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science.Broader Impacts This research will reveal some of the major mechanisms by which marine cyanobacteria have adapted to metal levels in coastal and oligotrophic environments. Thus these results will help us understand the distribution and diversity of these organisms in relation to global primary productivity. They should lead to more robust biomarkers for metal stress and pollution in coastal environments. The PIs will expand on a previous outreach activity like their museum exhibit on marine genomics at the Birch Aquarium, La Jolla CA, by developing hands-on lab components that will communicate some basic concepts around metal nutrition/pollution in the marine environment to middle school students. This will be undertaken in collaboration with Aquatic Adventures, who provide educational programs that connect underserved youth to science, inspire environmental action, and increase exposure to marine habitats. In addition an undergraduate and graduate student in the interdisciplinary field of the metal physiology of microbes will be trained NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR LIFE ON AN ASTEROID:  THE NATURAL AND ENGINEERED LIMITS OF ORGANISMS AT EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES AND EXTREME HIGH RADIATION Asteroids are playing an increasingly significant role in the space program. In 2000 the first ever re NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project and the Educational Testing Services (ETS) have formed a partnership to construct, pilot test, re-design, validate, and disseminate five assessments of student achievement for use in upper elementary grades as growth-sensitive measures of student learning in mathematics.  The assessments are in the areas of (1) number and operations, (2) pre-algebra and algebra, and (3) geometry and measurement and are based in the literature on student's cognitive growth in these mathematical domains.  The instruments are aligned with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Focal Points and with existing  mathematics knowledge for teaching  (MKT) classroom observation instruments.  These assessments differ from existing assessments in that the questions require more complex responses than typical multiple-choice problems.  Yet, they are still machine-scoreable so they can easily be used in studies with large student samples.  Additionally, these assessment instruments enable researchers to capture student growth nested within classrooms, which provides a tool that is able to identify teacher effects on learning.  By comparing students of teachers without MSP  treatment  to students of teachers with MSP treatment in a quasi-experimental design, this research project examines the effects of teacher mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) growth on classroom instruction and student achievement.  The project expects to find that high teacher scores on the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) measures are correlated with the size of student gains on the new assessment instruments.  Additionally, this project adds to the suite of instruments available from the LMT for exploring the connection between teacher learning, teachers' MKT, their classroom instruction, and student outcomes NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Salinity variations in the geologic past are difficult to reconstruct, yet important for understanding climate, ocean circulation, evolutionary biology, and carbon storage in the geologic record. In an effort to develop a new indicator of water salinity we will build on recent experimental results indicating that hydrogen isotope fractionation in algal lipids decreases as salinity increases.Intellectual Merit: Motivated by a recent report by Schouten et al. (2006) that salinity altered hydrogen isotope fractionation in lipids from cultured coccolithophorid algae, and the prospect this finding raises for paleosalinity and paleohydrologic reconstructions, investigators propose to test the generality of a salinity influence on lipid D/H fractionation in a variety of algal, microbial and archaeal lipids in a wide diversity of natural saline systems with salinities between 0.4 - 277 ppt.  Their initial results from Christmas Island and the Chesapeake Bay support the hypothesis of Schouten et al. (2006) that D/H fractionation in algal and microbial lipids decreases with increasing salinity. At Christmas Island they find a strong inverse correlation between salinity and lipid D/H fractionation in several algal and bacterial biomarkers and total lipid extracts over the salinity range 17 - 149 ppt . In the Chesapeake Bay they observe a strong inverse relationship between salinity and D/H fractionation in the dinoflagellate lipid dinosterol at salinities between 8 - 31 ppt.The proposed study will use water, particulate and surface sediment samples from 39 globally dispersed saline basins in Canada, the USA, Bolivia, Israel, South Africa, Kazhakstan, and the Galapagos Islands. This highly diverse set of lakes was chosen to span the widest possible range of salinities, limnologies, water chemistries, and climates. They will measure the &#948;D values of several different lipid biomarkers from algae (e.g., dinosterol, highly branched isoprenoid alkenes, fucoxanthin, botryococcenes), bacteria (e.g., diploptene, hopanoids, bacteriochlorophyll a-e) and archaea (glycerol-dialkyl-glycerol-tetraethers) in suspended particles and surface sediments in each lake, and compare those values to the &#948;D values of lake water. They possess all samples for this study.Broader Impacts: This project will support a female graduate student and facilitate the education of undergraduate and high school students in environmental research. Of 11 lab members, 5 are women, 4 are undergraduates and 1 is in high school. Two undergraduates, along with the PI, conducted the fieldwork to collect the saline lake samples for this project in June 2007. Their website describing their research receives over 700 hits per day. And the PI has been a science judge in 6 national high school science competitions during the last 8 years. These activities will continue to expose students and the public to cutting-edge environmental research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists. It does this by examining doctoral training practices critical to the transmission of skills acquired through close interaction and hands-on experience, also known as 'tacit skills.' Although an under researched area in scientific training, 'tacit skills' play a crucial role in the creativity and innovation in experimental and mathematical sciences, laser and nuclear technology development. While there is a standard set of accepted scientific principles shared by most scientists, there are also differences in terms of what is learned and how it is taught. This project focuses on Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Each of these countries has consistently exhibited high rates of innovation and productivity in recent years. However, while these countries have been successful in science education, each of them approaches the task of training scientists in various methods. The core hypothesis of the study is that student-mentor relationships significantly configure levels of scientific creativity, pioneering discoveries, technical innovation, and research productivity. The project's main goal is to develop an empirically tested and contemporary model of science that will inform science and innovation policy about the role of 'tacit skills' in knowledge production, and to enhance best practices in U.S. graduate science training. The project analyzes the different methods using analytical, conceptual, and methodological tools from the areas of knowledge sharing, social networks, and the extended translation model of science. While a component of the project will uncover the degree of codified knowledge that is taught by most standard text books and the mastery of this knowledge, the project also seeks to understand advanced knowledge acquisition and transmission through the study of graduate science training by exploring students' relationships with mentors and peers. Contemporary research has shown that the nature of informal educational practices is not only conducive to the acquisition of 'tacit skills' but enhances professional competencies. This Project not only advances understanding of how 'tacit skills' are transmitted, but also informs pedagogical programs, and generates 'best practices' in advanced scientific training that recognize the changing nature and morphology of knowledge production brought about by globalization. It enhances scientific manpower and infrastructure by establishing networks of collaborations across disciplinary boundaries among scientific institutions globally. This Project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project examines the information seeking and using behaviors of decision makers who face decisions about their future R&D investments.   A number of trends have made these decisions more uncertain, notably  Open Innovation,  the globalization of science and technology, increasingly diverse sources of technical and scientific information, as well as the global outsourcing of research to developing economies.  There is substantial evidence that industrial decision makers lack needed information; are unaware of available information; or need a more inclusive model of appropriate decision processes.  The study sheds light on whether and why industry decision makers choose global R&D over U.S. R&D.  It does this by examining how firms that are global innovators use information about scientific and technical resources, together with other innovation-related data, to shape their investment decisions and competitive strategies.  The project is based on collaboration with the Center for Innovation Management Studies and the Industrial Research Institute (IRI), whose 250 members collectively fund and conduct about 75% of U.S. industrial research. These firms' day-to-day R&D investment decisions are transforming traditional company-owned R&D laboratories into the  Laboratory of the Future  (LOF). Each firm's own  LOF  may consist of a traditional laboratory, a collaborative laboratory, a virtual laboratory or a network of external resources, including university researchers in the U.S. or abroad, as well as government or private labs, collaborative strategic partners, or simulation tools thus augmenting or even replacing company owned physical labs. LOFs are highly likely to vary by industry and by the competitive environment of the firm. The study examines participants' discussions of these decisions and the information resources they use to decide how to build their future innovation capabilities. The project analyzes the LOF discussion to reveal how R&D managers think long-term and strategically about what they do.  The project documents information seeking and information using behavior as exhibited in an on-line discussion by the decision makers about the R&D  LOF . In addition the research opens a window into decision makers' rationales for their investment commitments.Broader Impacts: Corporate R&D executives are making decisions now that will, in the aggregate, shape the LOF and affect U.S. national innovation system. This project documents how they are making those decisions, what information they are presently using, and what kinds of data might be desirable for robust decisions. The project results inform both decision makers in industry and policy makers about data and information sources presently used, not used, and data not presently available but desirable for the future NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER NEBRASKA MATH is to improve achievement for all students and narrow achievement gaps among at-risk populations by focusing on three key transition points along the mathematics continuum: the mathematics education of children in transition from kindergarten through early primary to grade 3; the algebra transition from middle to high school and the transition of new secondary math teachers from certification to the classroom.  The project is focused on four strategies; (i) Developing an active and mature partnership (sustained through state dollars after the end of NSF funding) by linking mathematics teachers and school administrators from across Nebraska with university mathematicians and mathematics educators and early childhood educators to improve mathematics education statewide; (ii) Strengthening the mathematical and pedagogical knowledge for teaching of participating teachers and their professional interactions with other teachers in their schools, while improving their attitudes to the teaching and learning of mathematics; (iii) Improving students' competence, beliefs and attitudes about mathematics, their appreciation of the importance of sustained effort, and their knowledge of mathematics; and (iv)) Contributing to the research in mathematics education through a mixed methods research design studying K-3 teacher's knowledge, attitudes, and leadership in relation to student disposition and achievement.A goal of the project is to create a model partnership, both on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) campus and nationally, where faculty in an academic discipline (in this case mathematics) and faculty in education work with teachers and administrators from the K-12 education community, sharing expertise and resources in pursuit of a world class mathematics education system.  NEBRASKA MATH partners the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with four school districts and 15 Educational Service Units (ESUs), in rural Nebraska, which provide support to 63 additional school districts.  The intent is to form a permanent K-16 mathematics partnership that is sustained primarily by local dollars.  Over the five years the project is to impact 900 teachers (750 at the elementary level and 150 at the secondary level) and approximately 60,000 students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The period between the late-Pleistocene glacial maximum and the early-Holocene thermal maximum (ca. 21,000 to 7,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic environmental change and biotic adjustments. The creation of new ecosystems in deglaciated regions was governed by the rate of ice recession, the nature of postglacial climate change, the characteristics of new landscapes, and the life-history traits of the biologic colonizers.The Yellowstone region supported the largest independent ice field in the western U.S., and ice recession after 17 cal ka set in motion a sequence of poorly-documented biologic events that ultimately led to the present-day terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This examination of the late-glacial and early-Holocene periods in the Yellowstone region poses the following questions: What are the primary controls of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem development on newly created landscapes? Specifically, how are past biota influenced by intrinsic biological constraints, landscape evolution, and subregional climate differences during a period of dramatic climate change? The study tests hypotheses concerning the importance of climatic and nonclimatic drivers in ecosystem development through an examination of lake-sediment records from sites that (1) lie along the path of ice recession, (2) span a variety of substrates, and (3) are situated within summer-wet and summer-dry precipitation regimes.Yellowstone is an ideal region to examine the development and structuring of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, because (1) the climate history of the western US is reasonably well understood from prior data syntheses and paleoclimate model simulations; (2) a well-documented glacial history of the Yellowstone region offers independent information on local environmental change; (3) different substrates and precipitation regimes shape modern ecosystem distributions and likely have in the past as well; and (4) previous paleoecologic findings motivate more-nuanced research questions that can be addressed with the acquisition of new high-resolution records.Intellectual Merit of the Research: Understanding the biotic consequences of climatic change is a major challenge in Earth systems research and identified as a high priority in recent international and US climate change assessments. The proposed study builds on existing knowledge of Yellowstone's past in an effort to better understand the resilience of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to environmental change, including abrupt climate events of the magnitude projected in the future. This project adopts a stratified sampling approach that is not possible in most locations where paleobiotic data are sparse, and the information gained will help answer basic biologic questions about the importance of abiotic and biotic variables in modulating the effects of climate change on species, communities, and ecosystems. The resulting synthesis will be a critical step in bridging the gap between current understanding of ecological processes on short time scales and evidence of dramatic change preserved in paleoecologic data on long time scales.Broader Impacts of the Research lie in its contribution to ongoing efforts that better inform the public, land and resource managers, and students about the importance of environmental history in the national parks, including an understanding of past climate change and ecosystem sensitivity. This project in particular, extends outreach activities in a number of ways, among them regularly updated web-disseminated information by the National Park Service on Yellowstone's history; education and training activities for Park staff on cutting-edge paleoclimate research; incorporation of Yellowstone findings in Park-directed K-12 curricula and university coursework; publication in popular scientific magazines; and content for a new museum exhibit on Yellowstone. The project also continues the PIs' commitment to train and educate the next generation of diverse scientists and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build multidisciplinary paleoclimate datasets for use by researchers, land managers, educators, and the public NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SES 0601801Vilna BashiRutgers UniversityOver the last 10 years, the number of adoptions of foreign-born children completed by American parents has increased tenfold over a wide number of countries, to the point where such adoptions number over 20,000 foreign-born children each year. Prospective parents tend to be racially white, professional class, and wealthier than average. This project is designed to answer two research questions regarding this surging phenomenon. The first is: How do agents adopting American parents and international adoption agencies make decisions about how they racially identify foreign born adopted children and racially represent the nations from which the children come? The answer is not predictable from the large and growing literature on what has been variously called racial formation, racialization, and ethnoracial assignment. These writings reinforce the idea that race is a system constructed on a premise that some people are more deserving of privilege and preference than others, but they also suggest that racial advantage and disadvantage is not doled out in a manner fixed for all time. Racial privilege, instead, evolves with changing political and economic circumstances. Much of this work is historically based, using legal and historical analysis to re-tell the story of this historical change over time. The project differs in that it attempts to capture a contemporary and ongoing racialization process. A second question asks: What is the relationship between gender and race in the international adoption process? This search for the foreign-born can be said to be racially motivated, as scholars have suggested that American race and class dynamics have created a  shortage  of desirable This  project studies a more contemporary manifestation of the racial assignment process by looking at the ways agents involved in placing foreign-born children in American homes construct those children's races, and help to set their racial identities, and to examine the relationship between gender and race in these processes. The principal investigator will use qualitative research methods to study the racial assigning processes in  three sites in which they occur. The first site focuses on adoption agencies' representations, via a content analysis of the print materials they provide to prospective parents, and through their websites. A second site of research examines the growing cultural dialog on international adoption as expressed in advice books on  how to  undertake an intercountry adoption, raise a child different from oneself, and ensure your child learns his/her  culture.  There is also a nascent but expanding children's literature on international adoption meant to comfort children who are foreign-born and/or explain the adoption to them as they grow. The PI will use content analysis in order to examine how print and visual media and other sites for advice in international adoptive childrearing (e.g. cultural camps) contribute to or hope to influence the racialization of these children. Finally, the PI will interview parents who have adopted foreign-born children  to understand parents' thoughts and processes about the (inter-) racial aspects of international adoption, and learn about their  practices in raising their foreign-born child. The broader impacts of this work include training undergraduate and graduate students.  Results will be disseminated widely and the data will be made available to other researchers interested in replication and reanalysis. This data availability contributes to strengthening qualitative research methods NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds.  In certain other animals, however, sex is determined by environmental temperature (TSD).   Among turtle species, however, examples of both types of sex determination can be found.  It remains unclear, however, how and why different sex determining mechanisms exist. This collaborative project will help fill this gap by comparing the chromosomes and sex-related genes of turtles using XX/XY, ZZ/ZW, or TSD mechanisms for sex determination.   Particularly, this research will test whether (1) all sex chromosomes in turtles derive from a common ancestral pair of non-sex chromosomes (or  autosomes ), and whether (2) the molecular evolution of genes located on turtle sex chromosomes differs from that of the same genes in TSD turtles, in which there are no sex chromosomes- i.e., whether the sequences of genes located on sex chromosomes change differently over evolutionary time than do the sequences of the same genes when they are located on autosomes.  This project will integrate undergraduate discovery-based learning for undergraduates into the field and lab modules of this project and will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology by providing direct training opportunities for students and their mentors, by engaging women and minorities through outreach activities, and by providing further opportunities for both the investigators to serve as role models for minorities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project addresses a crucial area in the globalization of science: the transmission of skills to future scientists.

This project involves the active participation of students from underrepresented Hispanic populations located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This participation exposes and socializes these students to actual multicultural research work and to professional scientific careers critical to socioeconomic development of the U.S. southern border NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL- 0823670PI: Elisa Giaccardi ABSTRACTIn this Communicating Research to Public Audiences project, the University of Colorado at Boulder, in partnership with the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks, the CU- Boulder Office of Diversity, Equity and Community Engagement, is building on the work they have done via their NSF research award, A Meta-Design Framework for Participative Software Systems, in which they have been developing participative software systems (PPS) and applications of the software.  Community of Soundscapes will employ newly developed mobile computing and collaborative mapping technology in programs that help users gain greater insights and stake into the shared environment in which they live and visit.  Sound Camera, a digital recording device outfitted with GPS mapping software, allows users to collect audio clips of their sonic experiences as they explore their cities, parks and other environments and upload them online onto a digital map through a Web 2.0 application.  They can then compose, annotate, and share soundscapes of the places where the sounds were recorded.  A Web site will be developed to expand the project?s reach to audiences not in the Boulder programs.  Professional development training will be provided for collaborators and through the Colorado Alliance for Environmental Education.  The educational goals are to promote literacy of PSS and engage the public in personally meaningful activities that benefit environmental education (cognitive goal) and expand environmental awareness (affective goal).  The project work and its evaluation processes (by Wells Resources, Inc.) are intended to advance the field of informal science education with respect to PSS and to study how these new technologies might affect shifts in the kinds of experiences various audiences prefer to have NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Packing and covering are dual notions that are basic in combinatorial optimization and in combinatorics, in general. They are different and yet very closely related. One important instance of combinatorial packing problems is that of graph packing. Graphs of size n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices. Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G. Important examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and Ramsey-type problems. These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models for many important applications. Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.The main thrust of the project is to explore a series of extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of their vertices. It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished. The particular packing problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning, and load balancing problems. It will be studied also from an algorithmic viewpoint. A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Sex is determined by genetic constitution (GSD) in most animals, such as by the sex chromosome pairs XX or XY in humans, or ZZ or ZW in birds.

Scientific and technical experts are best qualified to judge the scientific and technical merits of proposed research projects.  Increasingly, however, society is requiring that S&E funding agencies demonstrate a return on the public investment in S&E research.  In response, S&E funding agencies worldwide have incorporated considerations of broader societal impacts into the proposal review process.  But asking scientists and engineers to assess the potential societal impacts of proposed research projects takes them beyond the realm of their scientific and technical expertise.  The fundamental question of this three year research project is: What is the best way to incorporate societal impacts considerations into the grant proposal peer review process?  This research focuses on the ways in which different models of peer review incorporate the broader societal impacts of proposed research. The study assesses five different models of peer review across three US federal agencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and two non-US contexts: the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Dutch Technology Foundation (STW).  Using both qualitative and quantitative methods (data mining, literature review, surveys, and semi-structured interviews), this research develops usable knowledge by constructing a comparative matrix and analysis of these five models of peer review.The Broader Impacts of this project include: (1) funding 2 graduate research assistants, thereby laying the foundation for continuing work in the Science of Science and Innovation Policy; (2) integrating this research with teaching at the undergraduate level (in UNT's Ethics in Science course); (3) expanding the network of researchers exploring the Science of Science and Innovation Policy; (4) enhancing the understanding of the process of grant proposal peer review by informing all stakeholders in the peer review process (scientists and engineers, funding agency officials, policy makers, and members of the general public) of the project's results; and finally, (5) improving the peer review of grant proposals, especially in terms of the capacity of various models of peer review to assess the societal impact of proposed S&E research.  This project benefits society by improving the connection between the funding decisions rendered through proposal peer review and the societal impact of the funded research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CAREER: A Theoretical Foundation for Achievability and Optimization in         Privacy-Preserving Data MiningData mining has been successfully applied to support a variety of applications, including marketing, weather forecasting, medical diagnosis, and homeland security. Mining data without violating the privacy of data being mined, however, is still a critical challenge. How to mine patientsÕ personal information, for example, is an ongoing problem in healthcare applications. Emerging privacy legislation, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as the heightened public concerns about privacy protection, require immediate and resolute attention from the computing community on the protection of private information in data mining.This research involves the understanding, analysis, and optimization of the tradeoff between privacy protection, accuracy of data mining, and system resources in privacy-preserving data mining.  The methodology is to establish a solid theoretical foundation that defines the requirements for privacy protection in data mining, identifies the domain of privacy-preserving strategies, and determines the achievability of such strategies.  This theoretical foundation enables the design and optimization of privacy-preserving data mining algorithms that are realistic, generic, and efficient.  The research results of this project have broader impacts on the nationÕs higher education system and high-tech industries.  The ability to mine private data without violating the privacy of data owners is a must for a wide variety of corporations, universities, hospitals, and government agencies. Similarly, theoretically and empirically validated means to protect privacy in data mining would benefit all privacy-concerned individuals at large.  The impact of this project also extends to academia through educational efforts, including graduate and undergraduate student training, curriculum development, seminars, and outreach NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms.  Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. The project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western South Dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Tougaloo College, a small HBCU in Mississippi, through the HBCU-UP progam, will implement activities aimed at the following objectives:1) to improve retention in gate-keeping courses in biology, chemistry and mathematics;2) to strengthen STEM curricula through incorporation of new pedagogic approaches aimed at promoting a greater depth of knowledge of STEM;3) to promote more faculty and student research in the sciences with the aim at increasing student enrollment in graduate and professional schools in STEM; andSupplemental Instruction (SI), based on the classic SI model, will be implemented in gatekeeper courses as a retention strategy.  This activity builds on work done during the Tougaloo?s first five year HBCU-UP project.  Other retention activities will include attention to co-curricular STEM activities, including support of STEM clubs on campus, and the development of a new one-credit freshman course for STEM majors.New pedagogy based on NSF funded Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) will be implemented in various courses, beginning with chemistry.  In addition to the focus on gatekeeper courses, the curriculum development will include the use of web-based laboratories and development of new upper level courses to prepare students use of current scientific tools.  Some courses proposed will incorporate informatics (including data mining tools), nano chemistry and biology, and in-silico biology and drug discovery.  Activities aimed at recruitment, as well as ensuring better preparation of incoming students, are the summer pre-matriculation program that will impact 40 high school students per year, and coordinating with surrounding secondary schools to offer Physics.  Tougaloo College is among US top 20 producers of female, undergraduate physics majors.  The proposal points to an acute shortage of persons qualified to teach physics in the surrounding schools.  In order to address this, the Tougaloo physics department will direct the offering of physics for high school students, which will be taught on weekends and evenings.Faculty and student research will be supported both on campus through the availability of faculty research grants, and off campus through collaborations with other institutions and laboratories NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is a novel alliance among the state school system, Jackson State University (JSU), Jackson Public Schools and other public schools in Mississippi. The project also partners with the Ironwood Observatory and Education Center in Hawaii, the James Cook Universtiy Center for Astronomy in Australia and the NASA Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The focus of the partnership is on high school physics, chemistry and earth science. The project anticipates enabling 45 preservice teachers to obtain teaching licenses in high school science. Courses will be designed and taught by the College of Education and Human Development and the College of Science, Engineering and Technology. The project will provide 200 inservice teachers with 160 hours of professional development. The goal is to enable teachers to implement National Science Education Standards and the Mississippi Science Curriculum Frameworks for high school (9-12) education. The long term goal is to improve student achievement in science and to significantly reduce achievement gaps in the science performance within the diverse student population. The inservice component consists of two compressed 3 credit hours graduate courses. Each course will be taught in 10 days (20 days total), two weeks in summer and 10 Saturdays during the academic year. The emphasis will be on conceptual development for each major topic and will include coursework, inquiry-based laboratory work, demonstrations, hands-on activities, and problem solving with special emphasis on using technology as tools of instruction. Project team members will complete at least three follow-up visits to the classrooms of the participants NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PHASE II: NASA TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM The National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC) promotes technology infusion by creating awareness of technologies and areas of expertise developed in the NASA SBlR/STTR Program - and el NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The PIs will deploy an autonomous underwater hydrophone (AUH) network in conjunction with OBSs in the Lau Basin. Since T-wave generation processes are not well understood the PIs will use the AUH and the OBSs to compare and establish how to integrate the datasets, allowing them to constrain the tectonics of the region and monitor both earthquake activity and volcanism. The comparison will allow future hydrophone data to be used to extract quantitative information regarding earthquake source parameters and processes. Broader impacts include collecting both the seismically-generated signals and whale songs which will be used in the proposed development of a K-12 curriculum module that includes the building of a hydrophone. There is also graduate and undergraduate student participation and continued public outreach by the PIs at local, national, and international levels NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER NASA URC SPACE CENTER CONTINUATION CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY - LOS ANGELES This proposal requests funds to continue the investigation and development of key technologies related to critical NASA missions and programs. The research and associated educati NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CBET-0829092CannonNumerous U.S. groundwater sources host unacceptable levels of perchlorate, nitrate, chromate, vanadate, etc.  Available processes for removing these contaminants generally invoke use of petrochemical-based ion exchange media or membranes, which force municipalities and their suppliers to rely on non-renewable raw materials that are mined from non-sustainable and uncertain sources.  The investigators are targeting to devise means of employing instead lignocellulosic biomaterials (biocarbons) that originate naturally from within America.  The team will build on their recently-devised means of functionalizing the porous biocarbons with reduced-nitrogen groups that remove perchlorate and other oxyanions.  The project will link into the Sloan Fellowship program for Minority Ph.D. candidates at Penn State, which is co-led by PI Dr. Cannon.  There will also be participation in Penn State's CURO program, which facilitates minority undergraduate research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0754379MunnThe International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct nine to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Michael R. Munn to work with Dr. Peter M. Topping at Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick in the UK.The aim of this project is to work closely with Dr. Peter Topping and the Geometric Analysis group of the Mathematics Institute at the University of Warwick. First, the PI aims to continue his research studying the influence of volume growth on the topology of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Second, the PI aims to study the consequences of a lower bound on Ricci curvature in the more general setting of metric measure spaces. This concept is on the forefront of research in geometric analysis and has only recently been developed. As such there are many fundamental open questions. Lastly, the PI aims to study the behavior of Ricci flow in this more general setting and determine any topological or geometric consequences for the underlying metric space. Recently, Fields Medalist Perelman has used Hamilton?s Ricci flow to solve the century old Poincare conjecture. These fields are being actively pursued by researchers within the Mathematics Institute at Warwick, most notably by Dr. Topping, thus making Warwick an ideal place for this fellowship research. Dr. Topping is a leading expert in geometric analysis and has employed the techniques of geometric flows, such as Ricci flow and mean curvature flow, with great success. Dr. Topping is one of only a few mathematicians studying e nature of Ricci flow on metric measure spaces.  An understanding of Ricci curvature and Ricci flow in metric spaces is of great importance in geometric analysis and metric geometry. These original concepts have only recently been introduced and are on the forefront of research in geometric analysis. In Perelman?s work, he did not address the Ricci flow when singularities develop and this has been an important question of Hamilton, Lott, and others. In a very recent paper, Topping and McCann introduce a notion of Ricci flow for metric spaces. These advances are of great importance as they can be used to understand the development of these singularities. The PI?s current research involves prior work of Perelman?s involving Ricci curvature. The PI also extends these results to metric measure spaces. The Mathematics Institute at Warwick is a thriving environment and is undergoing rapid expansion. The large number of resources available within the Institute make this an ideal host site.  Currently there is great interest in the development of these new ideas for Ricci flow in metric spaces and these techniques have applications across the physical sciences. The ideas related to Ricci flow are closely related to those of mean curvature flow as well as crystal flow. Understanding the development of singularities in this context is essential. In particular, singularities describe the development of flaws in crystals. A deeper understanding of the implications of this research will enable the PI to be a better professor at a university with science majors and engineers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project develops a methodology and statistically implements a data collection and evaluation process for assessing the innovative performance of firms located on U.S. university research parks (URPs).  The results from the assessment phase inform the public and private sector about locational investments in science and engineering (S&E) activities occurring on URPs.  URPs have been an important element of our national innovation system for nearly half a century, and in 2007 the  Building a Stronger America Act  (S. 1373) was introduced in Congress under the stated premise that it is in the best interests of the Nation to encourage the formation of new parks and the expansion of existing parks in order to promote the clustering of innovation through high technology activities.  Surprisingly, very little research has been undertaken on science/research parks, in general, or URPs, in particular.  And, no research has been undertaken on the innovation benefits realized by firms that locate on U.S. parks.  This project broadens our understanding of URPs as a component of our national innovation system; develops an assessment tool for assessing the innovation benefits realized by firms as a result of locating on a park; collects relevant data to implement this methodology and offers empirically-based statements on realized innovation benefits from on-park research synergies; and offers prospective statements about the organizational structure of URPs that will be most conducive to enhancing the research synergies among park firms on new or expanded parks.BROADER IMPACTS:  The main intellectual outputs from this research are an assessment of the innovative performance of, and research outputs from, on-park firms relative to comparable firms that are not located on a park.  As such, this project's broader impacts include, from a national perspective, the development of park-based science metrics and policy prescriptions to enhance university-driven S&E-based economic development through park formations and park growth.  And, from a private-sector perspective, this project informs the locational consideration, and hence future research efficiency, of firms' S&E investments.  The project's resulting science metrics inform the consideration of new innovation indicators specifically related to parks.  The project's policy prescriptions inform not only Congressional deliberations related to the  Building a Stronger America Act  but also future state and regional S&E investment considerations for building new UPRs and/or expanding existing ones NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER An extraordinary explosion of new information on the human genome is becoming available from scientific research. One of the many facets of this enterprise is the characterization of the variation in gene frequencies that exists among human populations. Gene frequency variation among the world's populations has arisen from the net effect of all the genetically relevant chance and systematic events in the history of those populations past and present population sizes, the relative degree of endogamous and exogamous mating practices and how they varied over time, natural selection dynamics as the disease environment and climate changed, and the numerous subdivisions and mergers of ancient populations as humans spread around the world. The knowledge scientists are accumulating of the extant patterns of genetic similarity among human populations provides useful information to the many different areas where researchers are working to understand the roles those diverse factors have played in human evolution. This includes human relationships with other species from microbes to the other great apes as well as the more recent relationships among the human populations of the world as reflected in written histories. The Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED), created at Yale University in 2000 with support from NSF, makes data on human genetic variation broadly available for research and education. This award will support 3 specific aims supporting the overall goal of integrating into ALFRED the data just now becoming available from various research teams studying enormous numbers of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a few to as many as several dozen populations from around the world. The number of SNPs studied in these 'very high throughput' or VHT projects ranges from several hundred thousand to about 2 million SNPs distributed across the human chromosomes. The first specific aim focuses on greatly expanding the contents of ALFRED by automating the curation process sufficiently to facilitate the addition of these very large data sets. Other data from the scientific literature will continue to be incorporated with priority given to SNP results from populations not already represented in the database. The second aim of this project enhances the educational and research value of ALFRED by improving the Geographic Information System (GIS) interface, especially by allowing greater flexibility in the graphical display of data. The third aim is to enhance the user-friendly interface generally in order to help users access the vastly expanded contents. New and more flexible methods will be created to facilitate assembling and downloading useful subsets of the huge multi-population and multi-marker datasets. These improvements will also include expanding the explanatory text and static graphics for educating the users about the use of the database as well as background information on the nature of the information contained in the database. Currently, ALFRED is a fairly large database with almost 280,000 gene frequency tables based on more than 650 human populations studied very unevenly on more than 14,700 polymorphisms along with detailed population and marker descriptions and links to other informative databases. The addition of the data from the VHT projects will vastly increase the scale of the database on the polymorphism dimension requiring a variety of adjustments to help users as outlined in specific aims 2 and 3 in order to take advantage of the wealth of new information. These improvements and expansions to ALFRED will magnify the value of this resource for research and education in anthropological genetics and many other interdisciplinary sciences (such as archaeology, demography, linguistics, forensics, ethnography, and medical research) that already make use of the database. ALFRED thus will be strengthened in the service of a variety of functions for education and for interdisciplinary research. The enhanced GIS interface will help summarize information for various emerging new disciplines such as geographical genetics and existing disciplines such as genetic epidemiology. ALFRED will be able to provide even more reference gene frequencies for comparison with new data sets that researchers develop. The database can also assist in the planning of future studies by helping researchers focus on combinations of genetic markers and population samples that can test various research questions or to identify gaps in our knowledge that need to be filled in by collecting new datasets. In the broadest sense, the expansion of ALFRED supports a wide array of disciplines and educational efforts aimed at providing a better understanding of our biological history as a species. Additionally, one of the most effective means to combat the misuse of genetic information is to make data regarding genetic variation in our species widely available through facilities like ALFRED NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The stable isotope chemistry of water is a powerful tool for probing the atmospheric water cycle and has been used to advance our understanding of water vapor dynamics around the globe. Until recently, measuring water vapor isotope ratios was a time-consuming and laborious process, but advances in spectroscopic techniques now allow automated, real-time, nearly continuous measurements of the 18O/16O and 2H/1H (or D/H) ratios in water vapor. In addition, advances in remote sensing of Earth's infrared emission spectrum at high resolution now allow the atmospheric deuterium abundance to be mapped globally. These new technologies are very promising for climate studies, but we do not fully understand the biases in these new measurements, nor do we know how measurements made with these new technologies compare with one another and with the more traditional and labor-intensive mass spectrometric techniques involving vacuum flask collection and cryogenic trapping. Before the full potential of the new spectroscopic methods for water vapor isotope measurements can be realized in climate research, a program of instrument validation and intercomparison must be performed. The PIs will make measurements of water vapor isotopologues at the NOAA observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii using three different laser-based sensors and two different satellites, which will be validated against traditional mass spectrometry techniques applied to samples collected on site. The goal of this study is to compare the different measurement techniques in order to assess of the fidelity of these new measurement technologies and to provide new data on the processes that control the humidity of the subtropical Pacific. This comprehensive set of measurements will be made from October 12-24, 2008, in conjunction with the AGU Chapman Conference  Atmospheric Water Vapor and its Role in Climate , which will be held in Kona, Hawaii. The opportunity for this project has emerged from recent discussions between the PIs and colleagues from industry, NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Service d'aéronomie in Paris. A number of important resources are being made available for this project at little or no cost to this grant. The timing seems to be fortuitous as several of the scientists involved are planning to be in Hawaii for the Chapman conference, and the other resources happen to be available at the same time. Intellectual Merit Measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues provide important information about the Earth's hydrologic cycle, and new technologies promise to expand our understanding of the use and limitations of such measurements. The project will help to establish the foundation for climate studies using these new technologies by providing the first intercomparison between different ground and satellite-based techniques. The results of this study will be used to better understand optimal system configurations for climatological studies of water vapor isotopes and determine biases in emerging remote-sensing technologies. Moreover, the data from this project will help to constrain models of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle by providing the first continuous measurements of water isotopologues from an arid subtropical mid-ocean site. Broader Impacts The results of this intercomparison project will be important for the broader community of atmospheric water vapor isotope researchers as they begin to make use of the new array of remote sensing and laser-based techniques. The low humidity conditions atop Mauna Loa will test the limitations of the surface-based spectroscopic techniques and provide a sound footing for understanding the reliability of the instruments under extreme but climatologically important conditions. The results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at national conferences and will inform algorithm and instrument development in the United States and in Europe. The project will promote the training of graduate students by including them in the field program and data analysis. During the first week of the program, JPL scientists will make informal presentations to the students from University of New Mexico and Colorado University on water isotope measurement techniques and algorithms. During the second week of the program, the students will participate in the Chapman Conference, and the PIs will invite other graduate students attending the conference to join them in the field, either before the conference begins, or during the planned field excursion to the Mauna Loa Lab by conference attendees, which will also include a presentation about this project. In addition, this project will foster partnerships with industry (Picarro and Los Gatos) and with European colleagues associated with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer instrument NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Adaptation to the impacts of climatic change is now at the forefront of scientific inquiry and policy negotiations, but the current debate has contributed little to the understanding of the decision-making processes that shape adaptation and resilient livelihoods.  This interdisciplinary research project hypothesizes that cyclical (loop) learning enhances people's anticipatory capacity, which is reflected in more flexible and dynamic local and regional adaptation plans.  The investigators propose a resilience-enhancing approach that emphasizes an iterative way of analyzing and learning about changes and uncertainties in the past, present, and future.  By focusing explicitly on learning processes and decision-support tools, this project is expected to reverse the deterministic notion of presumably vulnerable groups as passive victims of climate change by highlighting people's skills, knowledge, strategic responses, anticipatory capacity, and agency for adaptation planning.  Research will be conducted in selected rural communities in Ghana and Tanzania using methods from the learning sciences, rural sociology, cultural geography, and participatory action research to understand how anticipatory learning (learning that helps people anticipate and adapt to change) occurs on the ground and how it can be enhanced.The contributions of this project are expected to be threefold:  (1) a theory regarding how anticipatory learning works in the context of climate change; (2) initial measures of people's individual and collective capacity for anticipation; and (3) pilot interventions for anticipatory learning tools.  The project will address new and important questions in decision theory with respect to processes that permit some communities to better adapt to change than others; relationships among social configuration, learning practices, and decision making under climatic risk; and dynamics in knowledge creation and action.  The project also will provide immediate benefits for the study populations, training opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa, and findings that have high potential impact on the pressing human impacts of climate change.  Through co-design of adaptation tools and interventions in Ghana and Tanzania, the research will foster people's capacity to influence their future through iterative planning rather than learning by shock.  The study will involve students in the U.S. in three ways:  (1) graduate and undergraduate students educated and trained through their direct participation in the conduct of this project; (2) undergraduate students enrolled in a course on climate change adaptation and study abroad in Africa; and (3) an interdisciplinary graduate seminar to design anticipatory learning tools with African colleagues.  The U.S. investigators will work closely with researchers and practitioners at African partner institutions (the University of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, the University of Ghana, and the Afram Plains Development Organization (APDO) as well as with disaster risk and development organizations (CARE International and the Red Cross/Red Crescent).  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Decomposition, the breakdown of dead plant and animal material, is a fundamental process that affects soil fertility and ecosystem carbon storage. Most of what is known about decomposition is from studies in high rainfall areas, but this knowledge does not translate well to dryland ecosystems. Some recent studies suggest solar ultra-violet radiation has a major influence on decomposition in drylands; however, other studies indicate the level of mixing of wind/water-transported soils with litter is the key factor. This project seeks to resolve these competing explanations through a series of laboratory studies and field experiments in Arizona designed to measure interactions among these factors. These linkages will be assessed in the context of woody plant encroachment into grasslands, a globally extensive vegetation change in drylands. This investigation will yield new insights into processes that affect soil fertility and carbon storage in drylands by combining the disciplines of plant community ecology, ecosystem science and earth science in a novel framework. The findings will be relevant nationally and internationally, as dryland ecosystems characterize major portions of the US and global land area, and may be significant carbon sinks. In addition to dissemination in the scientific community, results will be communicated to land management personnel and organizations through outreach programs. The study will provide training opportunities for four graduate and numerous undergraduate students. The collaborating institutions (University of Arizona, New Mexico State University, University of Kentucky and Loyola University) have substantial minority enrollments, and efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER UBM-Institutional: BioMathletic TrainingAn interdisciplinary undergraduate research program in mathematical and statistical biology is planned at Ohio State University through a collaborative effort between the Departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology. Research opportunities are also available in Computational Neuroscience & Cell Biology. The program will: (1) expose a broad group of students to research problems in the mathematical biosciences; (2) develop curricula to prepare students to pursue advanced study in interdisciplinary fields; and (3) facilitate participation of a cohort of undergraduates in an intensive and integrated research experience involving teams of students and faculty mentors. Beginning students will participate in a seminar course held during every academic quarter that exposes them to the broad area of mathematical biology; while more advanced students will participate in the program as Undergraduate Research Fellows (URFs). The URFs will participate in a mentored research experience during two or three academic years and the summer before their senior year. Each of the co-Principal Investigators associated with the individual research projects have active research programs. Many of the proposed activities will impact a broad group, ranging from students who participate only in the newly-developed interdisciplinary courses to those selected as URFs. The most profound impact of the proposal will be the production of a group of students who are aware of the opportunities available in research in the mathematical and statistical biosciences, who are prepared to enter into graduate study and careers in these areas, and who are motivated to continue working in interdisciplinary fields, in other words- the next generation of BioMath stars.

The collaborating institutions (University of Arizona, New Mexico State University, University of Kentucky and Loyola University) have substantial minority enrollments, and efforts will be made to recruit students from underrepresented groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER For nearly a century, biologists have debated whether past climate change promoted speciation in temperate zone organisms. Models of climate-driven geographic speciation were developed for many groups of temperate organisms, and a particularly detailed and explicit speciation model was developed for North American birds. Over the last decade, this paradigm for North American birds has become the topic of debate, and so a comprehensive understanding of how temperate zone birds were impacted by past environmental change events remains elusive. This project will directly test the paradigm and will significantly extend understanding of the history of the fauna of pine and oak woodlands. The work will use state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of diversification of North American birds in relation to past environmental change and will produce a multi-locus comparative phylogeography of pine and oak woodland birds. The project provides significant mentoring and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including many students from underrepresented groups, and gives these students a unique opportunity to work in a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary research effort between a small rural university and two large urban research universities. The project also will support a workshop for high school teachers from the rural and reservation communities of western South Dakota and provide them the knowledge and resources to teach about climate change and its impact on biotic diversity in their classrooms NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project will support analysis, integration and modeling of the Earth system based on the recognition that understanding the Earth system requires an interdisciplinary approach to bring together physical, chemical and biological sciences and their interaction with societal and economic issues as well. The International Project Office (IPO) will support the project on Analysis, Integration and Modeling of the Earth System (AIMES) to: achieve a deeper and more quantitative scientific understanding of the role of human perturbations to the biogeochemical cycles and their role in altering the coupled physical climate system, in the past, present and future; and better describe and quantify interactions and feedbacks between biogeochemical and climate systems, the consequences of human activities and decisions for these systems, and implications of global environmental changes for humanity.  The IPO will support AIMES activities to include activities to improve predictions of human-caused trace gas emissions, map past human-caused environmental changes, and integrate climate and economic modeling.  The IPO will also assist AIMES to involve expertise in such wide-ranging areas as climate modeling, ecology, hydrology, economics, anthropology, agriculture and forestry in order to generate new knowledge, a new breed of interdisciplinary scientists, and, most important, better predictions of environmental changes across the Earth. The IPO will also support AIMES efforts: to consider development of new strategies for developing scenarios for a possible Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); to collaborate with the Northern Eurasian Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) to develop a northern high latitudes activity that focuses on integrating across scales; to develop a new focus on Applied Earth System Modeling to make the global change research agenda much more directly relevant to the development and policy communities; and to support AIMES involvement in the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Virtual worlds are networked three-dimensional environments that simulate physical interaction in three-dimensional spaces and decouple such interaction from geographic constraints.  Virtual worlds open new avenues for education, business, and scientific discovery, and can significantly enhance collaboration in virtual organizations.  To accomplish this requires scalable and secure system architectures, complemented by appropriate tools for creating virtual world content.  This project aims to design, build, deploy, and evaluate a virtual world platform for use as a research and development platform for virtual world technology and applications.  The two major research thrusts are system architecture and content creation.  For system architecture, the project will develop: (1) continuous dynamic world partitioning for maximal resource utilization and fault tolerance, (2) a capability-based security engine that seamlessly enforces access controls, (3) a scalable content distribution network for bandwidth-intensive virtual world content, and (4) privacy-preserving archiving of virtual world events for scientific research and exploration.  For content creation, the project will investigate domain-specific modeling tools that leverage domain knowledge and community input to drastically ease the three-dimensional modeling process.The project significantly advances the state of the art in virtual world systems and three-dimensional content creation.  The scalable and secure virtual world platform will be able to support millions of participants concurrently interacting in a shared three-dimensional simulated environment.  The novel content creation methodologies will enable untrained participants to create unique high-quality three-dimensional objects for a variety of application domains.  Dedicated data collection capabilities will support social science, legal, and economic research on previously unseen scales, with analysis of large-scale behavioral data that may yield deep and novel insights into human and societal behavior NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Title: SGER: Collaborative Research: Exploration of Distributed Creativityin Multi-Site 3D Tele-Immersive SpacesInstitution: University of California-BerkeleyAbstract Date: 07/29/08This project explores the impact of geographically distributed 3D tele-immersiveenvironments on dancers' creativity and their perception of themselves and each other.More specifically, the project will study the impact of digital options, such as scale andmultiply, on the dancers' creative expression and improvisation. A formal notation,called a creativity graph, will be derived from a Laban movement analysis of thedancers' movement. A dancer develops a creative dance, a new sequence of phrases,when he/she generates a new association between two movement states (e.g. a newassociation between two Laban positions) based on some feedback from the immersiveenvironment due to either invoking digital options or due to some unexpectedperformance of the system. This project will have a fundamental impact on ourunderstanding of dancers' creativity within tele-immersive dancing environments andcomputing and will contribute a new concept of transformational movement graphs as acomputational representation of dance creativity in distributed multi-site 3Dtele-immersive spaces NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The International Council for Science (ICSU) will coordinate international science, bringing together the best minds to address global issues and to help make investments in science more cost-effective, particularly through implementation of its new Strategic Plan. ICSU will address a number of global environmental change activities, emphasizing its reviews and analyses of the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP), the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and DIVERSITAS (an international program of biodiversity science). ICSU will conduct these activities in large part through the efforts of its Environment Science Officer.Other ICSU environmental activities will include: representation of science (especially research) interests in activities of the international Group on Earth Observations (GEO), in particular in development of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS); promoting and encouraging international efforts to assure the effective and timely international exchange of scientific data and information; and the convening of international scientific meetings to advance research in the geosciences and environment, in particular, in the area of global change research.Assuming that ICSU's reviews of the ESSP and WCRP referred to above are positive, ICSU will continue its partial funding of the ESSP and WCRP program coordination activities.  The WCRP will continue to provide the structure that enables physical climate system researchers to develop long-term and short-term international strategic plans addressing key research questions, coordinate international activities on a tremendous range of scales, and engage in and seek out new opportunities for interdisciplinary research activities.  The WCRP will also be responsible for development of the increased knowledge and tools needed for operational and experimental climate forecasting. ICSU will expand and improve its efforts to advance research in the geosciences in developing countries - most especially in Africa - but in other parts of the developing world as well.A focus of ICSU's efforts will be to more effectively address the need to assure that the results of international research under its aegis are transmitted effectively to policy-makers and stake holders NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), which is comprised of 36 tribally-controlled colleges and universities (TCUs) in the United States, in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is developing an Indigenous Geosciences course series that integrates traditional American Indian knowledge and perspectives on climate, weather, and water with state of the art Geoscience tools and practices.  The series is focused on climate, weather, and water processes and issues that are particularly relevant to American Indian communities and tribal lands and is expected to provide a foundation for TCU students interested in climate change.  The courses are being designed to provide American Indian and other students the opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the physical, cultural, and technological issues associated with climate change and the mitigation of its effects on the earth and its people.  The course series has two components.  The first is a semester-long undergraduate climate change science course taught from the perspective of the traditional ecological knowledge held by Native peoples of North America.  The second is an Indigenous-based research practicum using Cyberinfrastructure-enabled access to Geosciences data, instrumentation and computing resource that provides an opportunity for Tribal College students to practice state-of-the-art e-Science, in collaboration with elders, community members, and research mentors at NCAR.   The project is being evaluated using the NSF-supported Indigenous Framework for STEM evaluation and should result in a program that can be used throughout all TCUs and other institutions of higher education NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER For the vast majority of human history, people all over the world have lived in small social groups as hunters and gatherers, and not in towns or villages. Agriculture has been claimed to be the driving force for recent population expansions: in the strongest claims, almost all current language families ultimately have their pre-industrial distribution because of agricultural expansion. While the spread of farming and languages associated with it has claimed a lot of recent attention, there has been very little corresponding work on the languages of hunter-gatherers. It is important for our overall understanding of social dynamics to analyze what drives change and spread among hunter-gatherers and determine whether such processes are different from what occurred after the farming revolution, 10,000 years ago. Researchers from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia will collaborate on work comparing hunter-gatherer groups on three continents (North America, South America, and Australia). In North and South America, some hunter-gatherer languages have spread over large distances, but farming and associated languages have also spread widely, and in some cases farmers reverted to foraging. In Australia, the transition to farming never took place but one language family spread very widely. Results from genetics, linguistics, anthropology and archaeology will be combined to clarify what the relative contributions of migration and language shift were to language spreads. Among the linguistic data to be collected are vocabulary in the fields of plants and animals, and kinship and social organization NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ObjectiveThe objective of this research is to develop technologies and methods towards realizing a miniature implantable many-channel wireless neural-recording device.  The approach is to develop and assemble sub-systems that can be programmed by neuroscientists to investigate scientifically and medically relevant neurophysiology.Intellectual MeritThe proposed wireless neural recording system consists of scaleable sub-system components that can be configures to acquire a broad range of neural signals.  Furthermore, it includes a digital-signal-processing architecture that performs on-chip spike detection and alignment steps in the digital domain, which are typically performed off-chip in software.  The proposed system also must operate while being subject to varying electrode conditions (i.e., impedance and offset voltage) while dissipating no more than several milliwatts of power to avoid tissue heating and enable (future) methods of wireless power transfer.Broader ImpactThe broader impacts include of the proposed work include: (1) technological transformation of important fields of research in neuroscience and neurology, (2) updating and enhancing the technological capabilities and experience of doctoral students training to be brain researchers or neuroengineers, (3) the involvement of undergraduate engineering students from underrepresented groups, and (4) the general education of California high-school teachers and community-college instructors that participate in annual UCLA-sponsored continuing-education events during the summer NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Optical flow switching has recently emerged as a promising new approach to address the exponentially growing traffic demands in optical networks. In order to realize this new paradigm for optical networks, the core network must be capable of wavelength reconfiguration and service provisioning on time scales approaching one second or faster. The present methods used in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission are designed for static wavelength channels, which can increase in number over time and may be configurable to form different paths at the time of provisioning. Provisioning new wavelengths is a methodical, one at a time, step-wise process of ?turning up? the optical signal along the path, which requires minutes to hours in order to achieve the final stable state, appropriate for GMPLS networks. Furthermore, the extensive literature on optical transmission assumes this quasi-static network environment. The intellectual merit of this project will be to determine both the practical and fundamental limitations on optical flow switched networks imposed by physical layer constraints, including optical transmission in a dynamic, wavelength switching environment. This goal is particularly challenging because of the multi-layer nature of the problem. The network topology and signaling protocols will dictate physical layer transmission requirements, such as how fast the optical signal must achieve an error free condition and over what transmission distance. Likewise the physical limitations both in terms of performance and cost will motivate design choices for the architectures and protocols. In order to address the multi-layer nature of optical flow switched networks, this GOALI project is proposed as a mechanism to utilize the novel optically transparent mesh network testbed facility within Bell Laboratories to extend the network architecture activities within the NSF funded NeTS-FIND Future Optical Network Architectures program at MIT. In particular, targeted experiments will be conducted in the testbed in conjunction with the optical flow switched network optimization studies at MIT. This new testbed has recently been used to study both the power dynamics and the transmission performance of signals in reconfigurable optical networks. These two elements are essential for understanding the physical layer in a transparent switched network and this facility is unique in that it combines these in a broadband, long haul transmission configuration, typical of core networks. This university-industry collaboration will have broader impact at many levels. The problem of scaling optical networks to serve the dramatic rise in internet traffic has broad social ramifications. The project will enable cooperation between two synergistic research efforts to address this important problem: at MIT and at Bell Labs. The academic participants will have the opportunity to work in a premier industrial research laboratory and benefit from the knowledge and skills specific to that environment. In the process, the program will provide a unique opportunity to merge the traditions within both organizations of promoting individual driven NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A GLOBAL VIEW OF THE ASTEROID BELT WITH THE SPITZER ASTEROID CATALOG SUMMARY: Natural philosophers Immanuel Kant (in 1755) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (in 1796) suggested that the planets of the Solar System formed from a flat disk surrounding the Sun. The o NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Science (31)This project provides scholarships for students seeking undergraduate degrees in Information Assurance (IA).  Each scholarship is for the last two years of a student's degree program.  Students are engaged in team-based projects -- motivated, for example, by the power grid, avionics systems, and enterprise computing -- in which they build example applications using the latest computer security techniques.  Upon graduation, scholarship recipients must work for a Federal government agency in an IA position.  This scholarship program is helping to address the nation's need for qualified information technology professionals working in government agencies.  The project involves outreach to minorities and to two-year college transfer students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A team of 22 tapeworm experts from 13 countries will conduct collections of tapeworms from the digestive tracts of vertebrates (i.e, birds, mammals, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, and sharks and rays) on land and in the waters of 20 countries globally. The project will likely yield approximately 1,600 to 1,700 tapeworm species new to science from previously unsampled vertebrates and geographic regions. DNA sequence data will be generated for 1,000 species, will be analyzed, and the results used to revise tapeworm classification. The existing Global Cestode Database will be expanded to include descriptions of all tapeworm species and enhanced to allow data entry from anywhere in the world.The project website will provide public access to information on new and known tapeworm species, and to resources including a list of tapeworm specimens available in museums around the world, keys to aid in the identification of tapeworms, and check-lists of vertebrates and their tapeworms. The project will include 4 post-docs, 4 graduate and 4 undergraduate students, and will result in the generation of 5 children's books, narrated by  spokesworms,  describing life for tapeworms in the various vertebrate groups. The project will ultimately lead to a global understanding of tapeworms and their hosts that is unprecedented for any host/parasite system to date NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SIMULATION OF SMOKE FROM THE SIBERIAN FOREST FIRES OF 2003 During May of 2003 large-scale forest fires in Siberia produced extensive smoke plumes.

Stochastic Continuum/Atomistic Modeling (LAMMPS-DPD); ? Multi-Level Parallelism,  and, finally an effort to make computing across multiple grids by doing a pilot of  TeraGrid-DEISA Grid Computing NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PI: Vesel, Judy Institution: TERC Inc Title: Shared Signing Science Planning Project Proposal No.: DRL - 0754587 AbstractThe Shared Signing Science Planning Project will develop a prototype of a web-based Signing Science Pictionary. The prototype will be piloted to families and caretakers of deaf and hard of hearing children to study the feasibility and effectiveness of the learning technology and identify the activities that are most effective in helping deaf children learn life science at informal science centers. The project team will also compile a dictionary of science terms with the intention of including the terms in a full version of the Pictionary. The final Pictionary will be comprehensive; including scientific terms from life, physical, Earth, and space science and will be presented in animated sign language accompanied by written explanations and pictorial illustrations. The project will also produce a video guide with a description of activities that parents can implement with their children. The planning project will result in a prototype with 100 life science terms of species found at the three informal science centers the children and parents will visit to test the prototype. These informal sites are hands-on and exploratory featuring marine organisms and a range of terrestrial flora and fauna to touch and interact with. To prepare for the site visits, parents and caretakers of deaf or hard of hearing children will be taught how to use the Pictionary with children through a Flash-based movie that introduces the interactive features and assists the parents in engaging with their children in three activities using the signing scientific vocabulary. The preparatory vocabulary work with the parents and children will lay the educational foundation for the visits to the informal science education sites. Families will test the initial project prototypes with deaf children using a control group for comparison. Pre-tests will be used to assess childrens' vocabulary before use of the Pictionary. Follow up tests will test knowledge of the new words and will include field observations of children in museums, zoos, and farms, where the new terms will come to life in corresponding exhibits. The results of the ongoing evaluation will be compiled into a guide for other developers of similar materials for the deaf community, and will impact the development of the final project. The project will broaden participation of an underserved audience in STEM learning and generate new knowledge about how to effectively integrate emerging learning technologies into exhibits and programs for deaf learners.The project team includes TERC and Vcom3D and collaborators from Gallaudet University Regional Center at Northern Essex Community College, the College of the Holy Cross, and the Learning Center for Deaf Children. Participating informal science education institutions are represented by the EcoTarium, Davis' Farmland, and the Stone Zoo. These partnerships provide the necessary expertise and support for the proposed project to have significant impact on advancing STEM learning in informal settings for children with hearing disabilities through the use of assistive learning technologies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Classroom students need to engage with innovative technologies (IT) in ways that better match computer literacy skills and applications in today?s workplace. The NSF-funded ITEST teacher professional development projects address this need by helping teachers effectively integrate real-world IT-based investigations into K-12 curriculum. This ITEST Study will examine the ways that ITEST teacher education projects lead to changes in classroom practice by using two teacher-role models to examine technology-based professional development and related changes in teaching practices: Teacher as Pedagogical Expert (teachers using existing technology-based curriculum with or without adaptations) and Teacher as Curriculum Developer (teachers creating new curriculum). The study will explore these two models within the context of IT teaching and learning. Specifically, we want to understand what kinds of professional development activities promote and/or influence changes in teaching practices and the integration of innovative technologies in the classroom. We will address the following research questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the two teacher-role models (curriculum developer or pedagogical expert) in teacher professional development projects that immerse participants in professional IT experiences? and 2) Does IT classroom implementation differ for teachers who have and have not completed an IT-immersion professional development experience  and does the difference (if any) vary by model?The research design includes a review of current and past ITEST professional development activities (surveys/interviews with project leaders and project artifacts), a broad survey of teacher participants from ITEST teacher education projects, and an in-depth study of a subset of ITEST teacher participants and comparison teachers to trace classroom implementation over an academic year. This project is a collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC, Inc.), TERC and University of Maryland Center of Environmental Science, all of which have extensive experience with the NSF ITEST program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a five-year project aimed at organizing a DRK-12 Resource Network to provide assistance for projects in areas such as research and development methods, implementation, and analysis procedures; synthesis of findings across the portfolio of projects; and national dissemination of the R&D contributions of the DRK-12 program. To accomplish these goals, Education Development Center (EDC) will join efforts with Abt Associates Inc., and Policy Studies Associates to implement three major strands: (1) Technical Assistance, which consists of (a) a portfolio assessment to define it in terms of composition and major characteristics and identify project needs, (b) individual technical work services to project leadership, (c) focus groups, (d) thematic meetings, (e) Principal Investigators (PI) meetings, and (f) a web portal; (2) Portfolio Analysis, including (a) synthesis activities to capture a comprehensive view of the portfolio in order to understand the role that the program has played in advancing K-12 student and teacher learning, and (b) evaluative studies of selected projects describing specific contributions to the field; and (3) Dissemination, comprising (a) the development of a white paper to summarize research findings on dissemination and implementation of research in practice and policy settings and highlight examples from the portfolio, and (b) a series of dissemination-related workshops NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Science (31)This collaborative project creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course targeting general-purpose multi-core processors for the senior-level and graduate-level students in computer science and computer engineering. In order to overcome the difficulty of teaching and learning multi-core programming, problem-based learning (PBL) is used in this course to ease students' transition from the single-threaded programming model to MTP. PBL-oriented course materials are developed, including real-life multi-core programming problems, mini-lectures, lesson plans, lab manuals, reference materials, etc. The course is taught at the collaborating institutions in two consecutive semesters without and with PBL, and the effectiveness of PBL is evaluated through analyzing data collected from a variety of sources, including pre-tests and post-tests, in depth interviews, and general evaluation forms. The project outcomes are disseminated through websites, email lists, CDs, publication, and presentations at professional conferences NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A team of 22 tapeworm experts from 13 countries will conduct collections of tapewormsfrom the digestive tracts of vertebrates (i.e, birds, mammals, fishes, amphibians andreptiles, and sharks and rays) on land and in the waters of 20 countries globally.

The immediate goal of both the predecessor project and this project is to articulate explicit and new theory by which to leverage change in institutions of higher education such that they take up and use existing evidence-based knowledge and resources for STEM education.  A longer term goal is to translate new theory for leveraging change in higher education into strategies for action that will mobilize and coordinate the efforts of STEM researchers, educators, and organizations already seeking to improve quality and access in postsecondary STEM education; and also enable and sustain the collaborative contributions of this STEM education reform community.  An ancillary goal is to successfully encourage institutions of higher education and STEM departments to rebalance their values and reward systems to more readily recognize and enable teaching as a valued professional role for current and future STEM faculty, as a form of scholarship, and as a respected career path at the K-12 level for STEM undergraduates.  This project enlarges the group of critical advisors.  During its first year of work, the earlier project discovered through careful analysis of critical knowledge and skills that it needed to enlarge the planned size of this group by 25 percent.  The combined project is now known as the  Mobilizing STEM Education for a Sustainable Future  project.  The project focuses on postsecondary institutions, which are critical in developing these capacities because they educate natural and computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, and also K-12 teachers, policymakers, and workers in business and industry. After they are successfully recruited, the subsequent analyses, creative thinking, and recommendations of the critical advisors will be synthesized and distributed to the STEM higher education community. The scope of work entails: (1) participation in two workshops planned and executed by the National Research Council, described in a companion grant proposal; (2) preparation for and participation in two CA meetings as part of this project; (3) synthesis of ideas and recommendations offered at the two CA meetings; and (4) preparation, presentation, and distribution of a final National Endeavor Team report that integrates the synthesis of the CA meetings with the outcomes from the NRC workshops NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Engineering (32)This collaborative project creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course targeting general-purpose multi-core processors for the senior-level and graduate-level students in computer science and computer engineering.

THE CRITICAL PERFORMANCE PARAMETER IN THIS DESIG NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award by the Division of Chemistry: Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, and the Division of Materials Research: Solid State Chemistry Program, to Professor Alicia M. Beatty at Mississippi State University supports studies on the synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-bonded inorganic/organic hybrid materials.  The supermolecular synthetic approach will establish new methods for the preparation of inorganic/organic hybrid layers with organic pillars (homo-metallic clay mimics) and hybrid layers with hybrid pillars (hetero-metallic clay mimics).  These novel materials are expected to have broad use in catalysis, chemical separations, and molecular recognition, as well as potential applications in the development of magnetic solids and semiconductors.  The educational plan provides students and teachers in fifteen high schools in the Mississippi State region with an opportunity to participate in chemical research.  Professor Beatty particularly focuses on encouraging women as well as underrepresented minority and economically disadvantaged undergraduate and high school students to take part in her research and educational activities.  Annual continuing education classes focusing on crystal growth, clay chemistries, and zeolites and minerals will also be offered to Mississippi science teachers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer Science (31)Alice 3 is is a new version of the Alice programming environment that blends the highly successful Alice 3D animation environment with the capability of going  under the hood  of Alice by allowing students to program directly in Java using a text-based integrated development environment.  Alice 3 will take advantage of the interest and motivation students find in video games and animated films while allowing teachers to cover all the skills and concepts mandated by computing curriculum standards.  This project is delivering a workshop for college teachers in computer science who teach the first rigorous course in computing (CS1).  Workshop participants are being introduced to Alice 3 and are being given the opportunity to test the software, to report bugs, and ultimately to contribute to the production of a stable version of Alice 3 NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This Phase I CCI will place chemistry at the center of research efforts to describe the molecular composition of the universe. The Center for Chemistry of the Universe will assemble a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary group of researchers to investigate and understand chemical processes in the interstellar medium. The chemistry occurring under the unique conditions of the interstellar medium produces the initial molecular starting materials for solar system formation. This chemistry, which produces a surprisingly rich set of common organic molecules along with more exotic reactive species, also supplies the molecules in meteorites and comets that may deliver the building blocks of life to young planets. Understanding this chemistry will require the development of high-speed broadband mm-wave spectrophotometers for chemical identification as well as new methods to probe chemical reactivity in cold gases and on surfaces. The Center will establish connections between fields such as combustion chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and materials processing that share the theme of  chemistry under extreme conditions.  The Center will provide a team-oriented, collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers. Synergistic center activities capitalize on the broad appeal of the space sciences and include a summer undergraduate research program, a university-level general science course, new web materials for the general public and display materials for out-of-school time programs in science centers and museums.The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation.  These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Bacteria, fungi and a suite of other microorganisms are the engines that drive many essential soil processes. They recycle the nutrients that all plants depend upon, they decompose organic materials that would otherwise accumulate, and they convert soil organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, though invisible to the naked eye, soil microbes can influence a suite of global processes, including atmospheric composition and global climate. While the importance of microbial processes is clear, much less is known about the types or numbers of organisms that are responsible for carrying out within-soil processes. This is particularly true for tropical rain forests, the most diverse biomes on land. In this project, a suite of techniques, observations and experiments will be applied to examine the factors that regulate soil microbial community composition, and to determine how seasonal changes in tropical rain forest ecosystems are related to changes in soil microbial communities.  An improved understanding of decomposition and CO2 fluxes in tropical forests is relevant to a variety of societal issues, as they play a major role in regulating global carbon and nutrient cycles, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. This proposal will provide critical support for two junior scientists early in their careers, as well as graduate and undergraduate students. It also will advance collaborations with Costa Rican scientists and contribute to outreach, conservation and management goals in southwestern Costa Rica via established partnerships with a local nongovernmental organization and a National Park stakeholder organization NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL- 0813135Communicating Climate ChangePI: Walter StavelozABSTRACTThe Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), in collaboration with the Yale Project on Climate Change and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, is conducting a three-year project whose goal is to build the capacity of twelve science centers as well as of twelve NSF-funded Long-term Ecological Research Centers (LTER) for the purpose of engaging the public in climate change science. The twelve sites span the USA from the east coast to Hawaii.  The goal of these simultaneous projects is to illustrate local indicators of global change.  Additional partners include ScienCentral, Inc. (TV media producers), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the American Geophysical Union, NOAA, Natural History magazine, and a national board of advisors.  Deliverables include: (1) twelve local demonstration projects with launch programs, exhibits/programs, TV spots, citizen science activities, and an interactive map illustrating the work of the twelve sites, (2) professional development for informal STEM education professionals and LTER research faculty, (3) a national survey to assess the USA population?s climate literacy, and (4) a culminating workshop for the ISE field, a permanent resource database, and a final publication.  Evaluation processes are being conducted by David Heil & Associates NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Coastal ecosystems are experiencing changes in nutrient loading and species composition much higher than previously measured, undoubtedly affecting productivity and sustainability of coastal regions. Predicting the impacts of these changes is important in salt marshes because marshes are among the most biologically productive areas in the world and provide critical ecosystem services, such as nursery areas for fisheries, removal of nitrogen, and shoreline storm buffering.  This project addresses a critical question: What are the effects of increased nutrients and species change on ecosystem services provided by salt marsh ecosystems? The project is the first to use whole-ecosystem experiments that alter nutrient loading and reduce fish populations to understand the effects on nutrient cycling, species diversity, food webs and the long-term sustainability of salt marshes.The damage by Hurricane Katrina due to degradation of coastal wetlands is one example of the importance of salt marshes to society. A growing appreciation of this role for marshes has led to estuaries becoming the focus of large-scale restoration programs. This project will provide information essential for developing water quality standards and  providing perspective for multi-million dollar coastal management decisions, such as construction of sewage treatment facilities, regulation of fishing, or rebuilding of lost marshes NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Experimental cybersecurity research is inherently risky. An experiment may involve releasing live malware code, operating a botnet, or creating highly disruptive network conditions. Realism is required in replicating attacks so that proposed defenses can be thoroughly tested and future attacks anticipated. This proposal, in addressing intellectual merit, seeks to develop a unique model for risky experiment management; enabling researchers to carry out experiments that interact with their larger environment while retaining both control and safety. The model forwarded here is based on a very simple line of reasoning: If the behavior of an experiment is completely unconstrained, the behavior of the host environment must be completely constraining, because it can assume nothing about the experiment; but, if the behavior of the experiment is constrained in some particular and well-chosen way or ways, the behavior of the host testbed can be less constraining, because the combination of experiment and environment constraints together can provide the required overall assurance of good behavior.  The key benefit of this model is that both experimenter and testbed operator can proceed with assurance in carrying out a wide and interesting range of previously unsupportable experiments. The ultimate goal is to develop both implementation and formalization of this model, including logical tools to reason about experiment and testbed constraint composition (broader impact). Initial work will develop mechanisms to support the model in the DETER facility and similar Emulab-based testbeds.The proposal was reviewed by panelists and received one Very Good, one Very Good/Good and one Good.  Panelists viewed all three elements of the proposal (risky experimentation support, dynamic health monitoring, and federation of testbeds) to represent contributions to the field, with the most valuable area of the three being risky experimentation support. The panel overall wanted to see a stronger case made for improving existing security testbeds in general, and particularly a tie in with current uses and needs of the DETER testbed by researchers. Panelists recognized the team as being well qualified for the work. If successful, the activities were viewed as advancing the state-of-the-art in experimental facilities for cybersecurity NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL- 0810261PI: Gabor Forgacs ABSTRACTIn this Communicating Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project, the University of Missouri is collaborating with the St. Louis Science Center on the development and implementation of exhibits and programs related to the principal investigator?s NSF-funded research on tissue engineering and organ printing, Understanding Molecular Self-Assembly.  The research is exploring basic research and technologies that could provide alternatives to organ donor transplants, especially given the mismatch between the demand and supply of organs.  The exhibits will become an offering in the science center?s new life sciences gallery whose goal is to help visitors better understand the applications of life science research that affect people?s everyday lives NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL-0822128PI: John RistveyInstitution: Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL)Title: NanoTeach: Professional Development in Nanoscale ScienceThis project is exploring the introduction of nanoscience curriculum into high schools. It is creating and studying a professional development model based on two products, the NanoTeach Teacher's Guide and the NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide. The NanoTeach Teacher's guide is being designed for self study by teachers (low treatment group) and for use in a facilitated development model (high treatment group). The NanoTeach Facilitator's Guide outlines the professional development experiences and provides guidance for facilitators. The professional development model combines (1) a design framework (Designing Effective Science Lessons based on the C-U-E model: content, understanding, and environment); (2) nanoscale science content from NSF-funded curriculum projects; and (3) multiple delivery methods. Twenty teachers are being recruited to carry out the pilot testing of the professional development materials. 75 teachers in the high treatment group are experiencing a 2-week summer workshop, asynchronous sessions while they implement their first lesson, Versatile Classroom (a synchronous, online video technology), implementation of a second lesson, and a final 2-week summer workshop. 75 teachers in the low treatment group experience a brief orientation to nanoscience resources, have access to the NT Teacher's Guide, implement two lessons, and debrief. The NanoTeach partnership includes Aspen Associates, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network. The research study is being carried out by Aspen Associates, and project evaluation is conducted by Dr. Doug Huffman of the University of Kansas NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Entrepreneurial Leadership in STEM Teaching & learning (EnLiST) Partnership is comprised of Thornton High School District #205, South Holland, IL, Champaign Unit 4 School District, Champaign, IL, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which serves as the lead among these core partners.  In addition, the following are supporting partners: The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), IMSA-affiliated school districts, and Thornton elementary and middle school feeder districts.  EnLiST intends to develop and build the infrastructural elements necessary to sustain a state-wide Illinois community of highly qualified science Teacher Leaders, who will effectively contribute to the transformation of science teaching and learning throughout the K-12 educational continuum in their districts. EnLiST will achieve these goals through a combination of intensive summer institutes and year-round professional development and collaborative activities. The synergy and continuity of these efforts will be ensured through establishment of an on-line community capitalizing on robust technological tools and infrastructure. EnLiST will commence with the development of core cadres of high school chemistry and physics Teacher Leaders organized into district teams. Next, the partnership will support and scaffold the activities of these core cadres as they engage in developing a cadre of middle school and elementary specialist science Teacher Leaders in their school districts. The activities of this latter participant group will focus on an interdisciplinary approach to science teaching and learning in elementary and middle school. Data collection and use will be a central theme in the development of Teacher Leaders and project operation as a whole. The innovation of EnLiST is its intent to reconceptualize the very notion of a  Teacher Leader  by drawing on scholarship in the field of social and entrepreneurial leadership and theories of distributed leadership.  EnLiST aims to create a new generation of Teacher Leaders who, armed with cutting edge content knowledge, a strong pedagogical repertoire, and entrepreneurial spirit, can support their colleagues and transform their schools into responsive and data driven institutions of teaching and learning.  EnLiST will provide participant science Teacher Leaders with understandings, skills, attitudes, and habits of mind enabling them to perceive themselves, and to act, as agents of change.  The entrepreneurial leadership skills that will be developed will arm these Teacher Leaders to meet the many challenges faced by teachers in the current US K-12 educational milieu, including dealing with resource constraints, uncertainty, and multiple goals often related to internally desired and externally imposed demands for change and innovation. They will be equipped to meet the challenges and tensions that have often impeded the adoption of innovative curricula and pedagogies and transformation of K-12 science instructional practices in service of addressing increasingly diverse student population needs. The major research questions of the project will center on understanding and assessing the development of the target Teacher Leaders and the success of those leaders in transforming their own teaching.  The ultimate aim is to develop a scalable national model for the preparation of social and entrepreneurial science Teacher Leaders who act as strong champions and effective initiators and implementors of change in pre-college science teaching and learning.  The EnLiST research questions are: (a) What is the impact, if any, of the project's activities on participant Teacher Leaders' conceptions, attitudes, skills, and behaviors related to social and entrepreneurial leadership? (b) What is the nature of the perceived organizational culture in partner school districts in relation to barriers to, and encouragement of, innovation and change? What are the associated roles of Teacher Leaders and school administrators? (c) What is the differential impact, if any, of enhanced social and entrepreneurial leadership among Teacher Leaders on effecting innovation and change in science teaching and learning in partner school districts NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scientific Research:  A mitotic spindle is present in all known eukaryotic cells and its function is essential for chromosomal segregation and cell division to occur.  Although much work has been directed toward understanding mitotic spindle apparatus structure and function, it is still unclear how chromosome separation is achieved on a microtubule-based structure that is itself in constant flux.  The discovery that microtubules assemble and disassemble at both ends of the spindle fiber and of the constant treadmilling of tubulin dimers toward the poles makes it difficult to envision how forces are generated to actually move the chromosomes on such a metastable structure that is not anchored in place.  For these reasons and based on theoretical considerations of the requirement for force production at the spindle the concept of a spindle matrix has long been proposed.  In its simplest formulation a spindle matrix is hypothesized to provide a stationary or elastic molecular substrate that provides a backbone or strut for motor molecules to interact with during force generation and microtubule sliding.  Such a matrix could also have the added properties of helping to organize and stabilize the microtubule spindle.  Four nuclear proteins in Drosophila exhibiting properties consistent with a spindle matrix have been identified and will be cytologically and functionally analyzed to test the spindle matrix hypothesis.  State-of-the-art fluorescent imaging techniques will be used to determine these proteins' dynamic properties, newly generated mutants will be analyzed to gauge functional consequences of alteration or loss of these proteins, and potential interactions with microtubules and/or an essential motor protein will be probed to assess potential connections between the spindle matrix, the microtubule spindle, and motor proteins essential for mitotic spindle function.Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts from the project activities will accrue at several different levels.  1)  Advancing discovery with a potential to achieve paradigm-shifting results.  The demonstration of a spindle matrix will fundamentally alter the molecular understanding of spindle function.  Thus, this project has the potential to change textbook descriptions of mitosis.  2)  Incorporation of experimental aims into training projects at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels.  The PI has mentored 25 graduate students, 34 undergraduates and 4 high school students over the years with 8 undergraduates serving as coauthors on papers.  Among the undergraduates, 11 have entered graduate schools, 8 have pursued veterinary or medical training (2 in M.D./Ph.D. programs), and 2 have chosen scientific-related fields (forensics, lab technician).  This level of mentoring will be continued under the proposed project.  3)  Recruitment of underrepresented groups.  During her career, the PI has trained 35 women, including 6 African-Americans, and 1 African-American man.  4) Establishment of international partnerships.  As part of this project, a collaboration has been initiated with a group in Portugal that has obtained funding from FLAD to send a student to the PI's laboratory for training.  5)  Development of research-based educational materials.  The PI has been active in incorporating research methodology into her cell biology class in order to encourage problem-solving approaches.  She has developed a set of PowerPoint slides that are available to other Biol 314 instructors that is continually updated.  6)  Participation in mentoring programs.  The PI has participated as a faculty mentor in a number of different programs, including  Preparing Future Faculty  (advising graduate students on future academic/research careers),  Project Assist  (a program that recruits minority students to Iowa to work in a corporate research setting for academic credit), the  Honors Mentor Program  (a freshman lab orientation program for one-semester research projects for honors students), the BEST (Biology Education Success Teams) program (a living/learning program for orientation of incoming biology students), and Ames High School Partnerships for Biological Sciences program (to mentor high school students on research projects.)  The PI has also been very active in making presentations to undergraduate clubs (such as Tribeta, the honors biology club) and area undergraduate colleges on different topics, including her research work or on career prospects in research-related fields.  These mentoring activities will be continued NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PRISM Phase II is conducting research on strategies that lead to changes in the culture of science and mathematics education where dimensions of culture include policies, practices, partnerships, and resources.  Research studies in PRISM Phase II are producing further evidence of how and to what extent distinctive PRISM Phase I strategies - K-16 Professional Learning Communities, Culture of Higher Education and a Public Awareness Campaign - give rise to these four key elements of holistic cultural change.  The Phase II PRISM partnership is producing these outcomes through an integrated set of research studies focused on the following questions: 1) In what ways and to what extent do K-16 professional learning communities lead to partnerships which change professional practice of K-16 educators and improve student learning in K-16 science and mathematics? 2) To what extent do policy change and incentive structures that reward higher education faculty to collaborate with K-12 schools and to strengthen their own teaching result in sustainable changes in departmental and institutional culture, including changed policies, changed practices, new partnerships and dedicated resources, in higher education? 3) To what extent do schools that participate in the Public Awareness Campaign have greater student motivation, greater parental involvement and higher student achievement in science and mathematics than non-participating schools? PRISM Phase II expects to culminate in replicable models for implementing the three strategies in ways which elicit changes in culture and ultimately strengthen K-16 science and mathematics education.  Based upon the successes of PRISM Phase I, the University System of Georgia (USG) has launched a STEM Initiative, in FY 2009, designed to replicate the successes of PRISM throughout all 35 USG institutions.  Through STEM Initiative funding, 12 institutions will implement K-16 professional learning communities and faculty incentive programs for participation in the scholarship of teaching and learning with faculty from all USG institutions invited to participate in STEM-focused Faculty Institutes on the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics.  The implementation of STEM Initiative-supported learning communities provide a broad base of activity to support experimental studies, as well as avenues by which the results of the Phase II work also immediately inform the work of the STEM Initiative team.  This provides a direct avenue of dissemination of Phase II results to all public institutions of higher education in Georgia.  Phase II research findings are also being disseminated through presentations at national and regional conferences and through scholarly journals and proceedings NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A Darwin 2009 Celebration Meeting will be held at the American Museum of Natural History and Stony Brook University over a 5-day period to honor the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin?s Origin of Species.  The meeting will combine public outreach and teacher workshop activities at the Museum with formal presentations and informal discussions at the University.  The goals of the meeting are to analyze history of ideas in evolutionary biology, discuss contemporary fields of inquiry and future research directions, analyze the impact of evolutionary thinking for disciplines outside biology, such as philosophy, sociology and humanities, and promote translation of science to the general public and media through education and outreach.  The meeting is designed to provide opportunities for intellectual discourse and development of evolutionary biology in a broad sense with potential impact on research agendas and funding priorities for the near future.  The meeting also will include significant outreach components targeted at science teachers and the general public with the goal of increasing understanding of science NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award to the University of Wisconsin-Stout supports undergraduate students' participation on software development for Single Crystal Diffractometers (SCD) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  SNS provides support for senior staff from University of Wisconsin-Stout during a sabbatical leave granted to one of the principal investigators by UW-Stout. The project is focused on raw data reduction and visualization needs of the SCD instruments at the SNS. Specifically, the project scope includes the following objectives: (1) to support and revise the basic SCD data reduction tools of the Integrated Spectral Analysis Workbench (ISAW) software developed by the principal investigators; (2) to develop tools for efficiently and flexibly forming histograms of event data in reciprocal space for efficient interactive visualization of reciprocal space and future studies of diffuse scattering; (3) to develop new and improved visualization software for SCD data and reciprocal space; (4) and to continue to support and extend the functionality of the ISAW viewers and code base to support their use at the SNS and elsewhere in the neutron scattering community.  Undergraduate students will help support and extend the ISAW code base and will be involved in the design, implementation and testing of components for the first three goals listed NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Mathematics (21) This collaborative project addresses a problem that occurs in many mathematics and mathematics-related courses at the university-level across the US: high failure rates in important early college mathematics courses, especially in Calculus I. The teaching strategy being used and tested is based on the idea of using Enhanced Conceptual Development through Focused Oral Discourse, or Orals. The current work is analyzing and extending  earlier work that has been focused on helping students identified as at risk of failing calculus. Based on the earlier success of reducing failure rates using effective teaching strategies, including Orals, the project team is now applying these teaching strategies to diverse users in several new settings: to classes taught in different STEM (science, technology engineering, and mathematics) departments, at a different college, and at different educational levels. The goals of this project are to: 1) Refine, implement, and test Orals with diverse groups of learners and in diverse education settings; 2) Provide training, coaching and evaluation for facilitators of Orals including Instructors, Teaching Assistants and Undergraduate Learning Assistants; 3) Provide extensive assessment artifacts of the implementations; 4) Create a database and website of new learning materials (Orals questions for diverse courses); and 5) Improve the retention and understanding of STEM students. Intellectual Merit: The importance of discourse in the mathematical sciences classroom has already been shown for K-12. A potentially important impact of this proposal will be to contribute to the national dialogue by conducting careful experiments that assess one method of increasing discourse: Orals. In particular, the project team will conduct proof of concept studies of Orals, in moving from small classrooms (the original setting) to large lecture sections. Broader Impact: Many STEM majors require successful completion of a calculus sequence; however, many university students do not achieve their career goals because of their inability to pass the introductory calculus courses. This project will address this important national issue. The new work will not only be in a larger variety of mathematics courses, but also in introductory Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering courses, and at a local high school in a two-year algebra course NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER GENEVOT-IV: XTOOLSS PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT In this research - a number of engineering design and optimization problems will be used to form X-TOOLSS applications. These problems will form a set of demos that will become part of the X-TOO NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Recently, the 230Th constant-flux proxy (CFP) profiling method of calculating sediment accumulation rates (ARs) has become a topic of significant controversy, especially with respect to the issue of sediment focusing and its quantification.  Depending on whether one derives ARs using age models or CFPs leads to vastly different interpretations in paleoceanographic studies.   Under this award the PIs will investigate sediment redistribution processes to determine the veracity of the 230Th CFP.  They will measure another CFP with an independent source term, namely interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), and the extraterrestrial 3He contained therein.  Agreement between 230Th and 3He variations in varied and well-studied depositional environments in the North Atlantic would constitute further support for the use of both CFPs for flux normalization. The data generated on sites with known amounts of sediment focusing and winnowing will help constrain the influence of abyssal currents on IDPs and the sediments carrying adsorbed 230Th, and will provide insights into the extent of hydrodynamic sorting of these particles. When combined with 14C and paired 3He and 230Th measurement on various separated fractions of the fine-grained component of the sediment, the PIs will test the hypotheses that 1) 3He is less sensitive than 230Th to sediment focusing, and 2) the degree to which sediment redistribution processes fractionate 3He-containing IDPs from the 230Th containing portion of the sediment. In the future, the proponents hope to develop a new proxy (3He/230Th ratio) for changes in the strength of deep-sea currents in association with past climatic changes.   This project will involve students in their teaching, training and learning NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Passive seismic methods form the core of this 3-year, multi-disciplinary proposal designed to investigate temporal and spatial relationships between ice motion, basal processes and iceberg calving at a rapidly changing tidewater glacier. The proposed measurements will link glacier-generated seismic signatures to physical glaciological processes. At present, glacier generated waveforms are poorly understood. Understanding their source mechanisms could advance knowledge of the dynamic mass balance of Earth?s cryosphere, as well as improve models and understanding of glacier erosion and landscape evolution. Preliminary results from a 1-year pilot study highlight the tidewater glaciersof Icy Bay, Alaska as the regionally dominant source of glacier-generated seismic energy. Icy Bay is the optimal study site because of its highly dynamic glaciers, logistical simplicity and similarities with disintegrating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Pilot study results show potential to make use of long duration, high-resolution records of motion, seismicity and changes in geometry in concert to develop quantitative proxies for glacier erosion.The proposed work will record seismic events within a local network with densestation spacing, and simultaneously observe 3-D ice displacement and glacier geometry changes. Iceberg calving and basal processes are challenging to measure, and applying readily available and highly developed seismic methods to these problems holds significant promise. The proposal will support the collaboration of three early-career scientists with multi-disciplinary backgrounds. Data from the experiments will be archived at UNAVCO, IRIS, NSIDC and at the University of Alaska.and iceberg calving flux NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Project TitleMCEER Hurricane Gustav Reconnaissance: Lessons Learned by New Orleans Hospitals from Katrina to Gustav and BeyondAbstractThe proposed project investigates decision making under uncertain conditions by examining the response of acute care hospitals in the New Orleans area before, during, and immediately after Hurricane Gustav including the evacuation and return of hospital patients and staff. ?Quick response? methodology will be used to gather information via observation of behaviors and facilities, document acquisition and evaluation, and semi-structured, face-to-face interviews of up to 30 hospital executives representing all 10 of the acute care hospitals in the New Orleans area. This qualitative approach is intended to provide a rich, context-aware understanding of the decision making by hospital executives in the New Orleans area with respect to emergency preparedness plans and execution. The project extends research conducted by the researchers after Hurricane Katrina and thus takes advantage of a natural experiment that allows the researchers to: (1) identify revisions to hospital emergency plans following Hurricane Katrina, (2) understand how revised emergency procedures were implemented during Hurricane Gustav, (3) assess outcomes of revised emergency procedures, and (4) make recommendations for improved hospital emergency procedures and healthcare planning in a region with recurrent and predictable natural disasters. The research thus examines whether Hurricane Katrina was a ?turning point? event for New Orleans area acute care hospitals. Organizations that fail to learn from disaster experiences are likely to repeat the mistakes that made them vulnerable. Lessons learned will be disseminated to a broad array of individuals and organizations through publications (e.g., MCEER Technical Report, peer-reviewed journal articles) and presentations (e.g., to the Academy of Management, to EERI, to regional and state agencies).Hospitals, along with power systems, water supply, and critical infrastructure) are vital components of a community?s critical lifelines, and emergency planning and leadership decision-making should ensure that hospitals are able to respond to a disaster and not become victims of a disaster (like some New Orleans hospitals did during and after Hurricane Katrina). In considering the consequences of disasters for communities, hospitals merit special attention thanks to their complexity and occupancy characteristics and because of their critical role in lifeline maintenance before, during, and after extreme events. Lessons learned from emergency planning and operations for hospitals for Hurricane Gustav will be broadened so that they are useful not only for hurricanes but for a variety of extreme events and not just for hospitals but for other institutions and organizations as well. Any organization that depends on the external environment for essential inputs (e.g., human resources, energy, supplies) to routine operations risks disruptions to those operations if sound emergency planning does not plan for resiliency. Learning from the experiences of hospital administrators and emergency officials who led organizations during extreme events should enable future organizations to be more resilient when facing various crises NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LANDSAT MISSION: LEGACY PROJECT / FOREST DISTURBANCE FROM ASTER / AND WATER VULNERABILITY-We plan over the next three years to research and compile the Landsat Mission technical history; from the many original sources we h NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization. Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Dr. Andrea Ghez (University of California - Los Angeles), along with collaborators Marshall Perrin (University of California - Los Angeles) and Rachel Kuzio de Naray (University of California - Irvine) will organize and conduct the seventh annual symposium of the National Science Foundation Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) program. The symposium, to be held January 3-4, 2009 in Long Beach, California, will bring together the AAPF fellows, faculty mentors, prospective AAPF applicants, and interested members of the astronomical community. This will allow the fellows to present their research and educational activities, and to better establish ways to enrich the fellowship experience itself. Additionally, fellows will obtain opportunities to establish interdisciplinary projects with colleagues during the symposium. The integration of educational activities into the research efforts of the fellows provides for a broad impact of the fellowship program. Many fellows participate in K-12/public outreach activities, leading to enhancement of the public's interest in science. The symposium will allow the fellows to share their ideas and experiences, not only among themselves, but also with faculty mentors and with others in attendance NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0824978ZachosThis proposal seeks funding for a new gas source dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a Kiel carbonate device. Requested is a Thermo MAT 253 with a Kiel IV prep device. The system will be capable of routine carbon and oxygen isotope analyses from carbonates with high precision and low sample size (~5 µg C). The acquisition will allow the use of individual acid reaction vessels, increasing precision and minimizing sample sizes. The instrument will add to existing analysis capability. General research themes outlined for the new instrumentation fall into the areas of paleoclimatology, paleoceanography and paleoecology. One focus is understanding the biogeochemistry and climate evolution of the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic ?greenhouse? worlds; the causes and evolution of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The PI intends to measure shell carbonates spanning the PETM in the fossil record. Shell analysis obviates artifacts due to sediment reworking or bioturbation, but requires low sample volumes. A related project will look at the coupling of biogeochemical cycling, including nutrients, and climatic forcings during the PETM. The instrument will also be applied to understanding paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental forcings on the ecology, evolution of extant and ancient vertebrates (extinct). In addition, foraminiferal isotope analysis will be used to reconstruct paleoclimates associated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Aside from the PI and co-PI research thrusts, a number of other PIs at UCSC and elsewhere will be supported. The management plan has the new instrument replacing an Optima (which will be retired). No additional laboratory space will thus been needed. A lead technician and lab manager is currently employed and partial support is requested in Year 1. Zachos will oversee the installation and initial management of the Kiel IV device. It is expected that grant support and per-sample fees will support the facility long-term. The UCSC Stable Isotope Laboratory operates on an open access policy. This helps attract users from UCSC, other regional institutions and the international scientific community. Users have been roughly ~50% female. Recharge rates are kept low and the laboratory manager provides extensive training. UC-wide programs such as the California Alliance for Minority Participation ensures a diverse in-house user base NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Groundwater flow systems within the Great Basin, Nevada are remarkable in many respects. Despite the arid conditions and relatively low permeability volcanic rocks and basin fill, this region hosts active geothermal systems and world class Eocene age gold deposits. Temperature profiles, fluid inclusion studies, and isotopic evidence suggest that modern and fossil hydrothermal systems share many common features including the absence of a clear magmatic fluid source, discharge areas restricted to fault zones, and remarkably high temperatures ( >200 °C) at shallow depths (200-1500 m). Many of the Great Basin geothermal systems exhibit some of the highest shallow crustal heat flow levels ever recorded ( > 2000 mW/m2 at Beowawe) within the continental crust. Geochemical and isotopic data collected at the Beowawe geothermal system suggests that fluid circulation is deep (> 5 km) and comprised of relatively unexchanged Pleistocene meteoric water with small ä18O (The goal of this proposal is to understand the three-dimensional plumbing, fluid flow impelling mechanisms, and temporal evolution of modern and fossil hydrothermal flow systems within the Great Basin. We wish to evaluate two end member questions regarding the nature of hydrothermal circulation within the Great Basin: A) Is flow restricted to high permeability fault planes driven by free-convection? or B) is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Because of the lack of broad low heat flow anomalies adjacent to Great Basin geothermal fields, we suspect that these flow systems must be episodic in nature due to permeability reduction associated with silica mineralization. By including the systematics of silica precipitation (and associated porosity/permeability reduction), we hope to constrain the duration of these geothermal systems. We will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin. We will develop geologically/geophysically constrained, three-dimensional hydrothermal models of the modern Beowawe and fossil Carlin geothermal systems; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and stratigraphy. A unique feature of the proposed work is that we will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to test our models. We will also develop more sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models using PFLOTRAN incorporating porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions to constrain how long the Carlin flow systems remained active before becoming clogged by gangue mineralization. By dating organic matter (pollen) within the hot springs deposits at Beowawe using 14C dating methods, we hope to determine whether or not these hot springs deposits formed during a single event or in several episodes.Our study may help document the existence of time-dependent natural convection systems within the Great Basin. Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of fluid circulation within this region is of great societal relevance because this region may soon host our nation?s high level nuclear wastes. The project will support two graduate students at New Mexico Tech and University of Missouri at Columbia NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Data-intensive science requires tera- and peta-scale computing. Hardware demands are high, and software, from system to application level, is highly specialized. As a result, scientific investigation is constrained. New and more accessible models for large-scale computing are required. The proposed program seeks to leverage new off-the-shelf computing technologies to develop concepts and tools (e.g., programming strategies, general-purpose and domain-specific libraries) to enable practical and transparent Scalable Heterogeneous Computing (SHC). Results will be applied to three cutting-edge challenges in radio astronomy, quantum chemistry, and neuroscience. These three applications share the need to process massive data streams. They broadly span a parameter space of processing challenges, defined by complexity in computation, data volume, and throughput. Addressing these requires scalable algorithms for massive datasets, systems with high-bandwidth memory access, and the ability to process high-throughput data streams.    Proposed SHC strategies, tools, and optimizations would develop, for general scientific computing, use of massively parallel graphics processing units (GPUs) and fast, low-power, large-volume, solid-state storage (SSS) devices that are commercially available. The tools developed will be applied to the analysis of radioastronomy data generated by the Muchison Wide-Field Array, the development of a SHC-enabled molecular quantum chemistry code, and to the Connectome project, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity of mammalian brains. Education is tightly integrated into the SHC program at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Initiatives to disseminate results will include tutorials and documented open-source libraries as well as workshops.LAY ABSTRACTScientists engaged in data-intensive research, from astronomy to neuroscience, are in desperate need of new strategies and tools. This project approaches the challenge by leveraging new off-the-shelf hardware and software technologies in unique combinations. The project will bring massively parallel graphics processing units and fast solid-state storage devices together with traditional central processing units. Project staff will develop scalable algorithms that leverage this commercially available hardware to process massive data sets and streams of data. The project will use three major scientific challenges as testbeds for development of these new approaches: a radioastronomy telescope called the Murchison Wide-Field Array; exploration of chemistry at the quantum level; and the Connectome, an effort to make a complete map of the neuron connectivity in mammalian brains. Postdoctoral researchers from astronomy, chemistry, neuroscience, and computer science will work together at Harvard?s Initiative in Innovative Computing, where they will combine experience from these domains to develop algorithms and code to broadly enable advances in science. The project will include tutorials, workshops and documented code libraries and a strong educational component NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Collaborative Research: Time-Dependent Hydrothermal Convection within the Great Basin, NevadaIs groundwater flow restricted  to  high permeability  fault planes driven by free-convection?  Or, is flow driven by water-table topographic gradients  with some combination of matrix and fault controlled fluid circulation? Are these systems fundamentally transient and self-sealing due to gaunge mineralization, or , is permeability enhanced by  carbonate dissolution? To evaluate these problems we will develop a suite of 3D, single-phase, hydrothermal models using a new parallel finite element code (PGEOFE) for two field sites within the Great Basin.  We will utilize a new three-dimensional (3-D) geologic model of  the  modern Beowawe geothermal system and, with USGS colleagues, develop another 3-D geologic model of the Eocene  Carlin system; two sites with rich , isotopic, geochemical and geothermal data sets. Using LaGrit mesh generation software, these hydrogeologic models will honor known fault geometries, widths, and  stratigraphy. This mesh generation software will allow us to honor low grid aspect ratios (required by the AZTEC parallel solver package)  as the grid transitions from strata to faults while allowing sufficient refinement to minimize numerical grid dispersion when solving the heat and mass transport equations.  We will use multiple constraints including temperature profiles, shallow heat flow maps, fluid/rock ä 18O composition, and the age of hot springs deposits to constrain our models. At Beowawe, by dating pollen in the sinter terrace and adualria in exposed veins nearby we can get a sense of the timing of episodic discharges of hot fluid up the faults and on the duration of such discharges recorded by the sinter deposits. More sophisticated reactive-transport geochemical models will be developed using PFLOTRAN  to evaluate porosity-enhancing carbonate dissolution reactions and ?sealing gangue precipitation reactions in each system. Our models will be validated by comparing modern and fossil geochemical and thermal proxies . The project will support two graduate students at New Mexico Tech and University of Missouri at Columbia. Initial results will be presented to industry representatives from Beowawe power plant, Barrick and Newmont gold mines for their input and feedback to improve the final result. Results will be published at the Geological Society of Nevada 2010 symposium and scientific journals to reach local and international audiences NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER OBSERVATIONS AND MODELING OF ALFVEN WAVES IN THE LOW ATMOSPHERE- Alfven waves have long been invoked as a possible mechanism for the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the solar wind.

The project extends across the nation, involving four LTER research sites and 22 K-12 schools/districts with direct impacts on over 250 science and mathematics teachers and 70,000 students of highly diverse backgrounds. The work focuses on coupled human-ecosystem interactions in the context of socio-ecological systems as a framework to develop a culturally relevant ecology from both a scientific and educational perspective.  The following research, professional development and institutional goals unify the project:Research Goals -      1: Refine and extend current frameworks and assessments for learning progressions leading to environmental science literacy and associated mathematics that focus on carbon cycling, water systems, and biodiversity in socio-ecological systems.      2: Assess the relationship between students' learning about socio-ecological systems and engagement in citizenship practices and local socio-ecological factors, including students' culture, socioeconomic status, region, and educational level.      3: Use teaching experiments conducted by participating teachers and graduate students to develop and disseminate improved frameworks, assessments, and teaching resources for environmental science literacy. Professional Development (PD) Goals -      4: Develop models of PD that integrate the research efforts of scientists with the professional development needs of K-12 teachers to include a teacher-in-residence program, research internships for teachers, placement of graduate students into K-12 classrooms, professional development workshops leading to graduate credit and/or graduate degrees, and professional learning communities.      5: Develop models of culturally responsive engagement that connect culturally relevant ecological content with different populations of learners. Institutional Goals -      6: Integrate culturally relevant, environmental content-based, PD models for K-12 teachers into district and university programs and outreach activities through the development of graduate training and degrees and in service-learning tracks.      7: Increase the awareness, opportunities and participation of K-12 teachers in content-based professional development activities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Studying the contributions of U.S. universities to the innovation process and National Income is important to understanding how our current economic status has been achieved and to how our international competitiveness may be maintained or increased. This project models a key component of the innovation system, particularly creation and deployment of knowledge and the flows of financial resources. The objectives of this work are to produce estimates of the contributions of various combinations of university resources, especially those of STEM units, to outcomes that represent intermediate steps in the innovation process and that contribute to NI and thus to U.S. competitiveness.The key insight of the project is that universities produce multiple outputs--for example supplies of highly skilled labor and new knowledge. The importance of this labor and technological development to the national economy has been well established in both classical and evolutionary economic theory.  In addition, universities serve as support institutions for firms and industries. Universities contribute to intermediate outcomes that stimulate innovation processes and fuel the national economy. The primary emphasis is to use data to develop new models explaining the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate (to National Income growth) university outcomes, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness and hence the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions.The project builds a relational meta data base that examines the relationships among resource deployment in U.S. universities and intermediate university outcomes related to innovation and economic growth. The data for the project are derived from a variety of sources at the institutional, departmental, and individual levels. Intermediate and final outcomes include wages paid, the production of graduates, patents, licenses, start-up and spin-off companies, consultancies, joint industry-university grants and contracts, job-training programs for firms? employees, and importantly, research papers. ?Inputs? related to these outcomes include various university resources: e.g., the human resources of university faculty, staff, and student workers; the time allocations of these individuals across teaching, research and service; and the allocation of the university?s own financial resources. BROADER IMPACTS: The benefits include advancing understanding of the relationships among resource deployment in U. S. universities and intermediate university outcomes in STEM fields. These are outcomes that are important to U.S. economic growth and ultimately to international competitiveness. Thus, the models can be used to inform science and technology investment decisions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The stable isotope chemistry of water is a powerful tool for probing the atmospheric water cycle and has been used to advance our understanding of water vapor dynamics around the globe. Until recently, measuring water vapor isotope ratios was a time-consuming and laborious process, but advances in spectroscopic techniques now allow automated, real-time, nearly continuous measurements of the 18O/16O and 2H/1H (or D/H) ratios in water vapor. In addition, advances in remote sensing of Earth's infrared emission spectrum at high resolution now allow the atmospheric deuterium abundance to be mapped globally. These new technologies are very promising for climate studies, but we do not fully understand the biases in these new measurements, nor do we know how measurements made with these new technologies compare with one another and with the more traditional and labor-intensive mass spectrometric techniques involving vacuum flask collection and cryogenic trapping. Before the full potential of the new spectroscopic methods for water vapor isotope measurements can be realized in climate research, a program of instrument validation and intercomparison must be performed. The PIs will make measurements of water vapor isotopologues at the NOAA observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii using three different laser-based sensors and two different satellites, which will be validated against traditional mass spectrometry techniques applied to samples collected on site. The goal of this study is to compare the different measurement techniques in order to assess of the fidelity of these new measurement technologies and to provide new data on the processes that control the humidity of the subtropical Pacific. This comprehensive set of measurements will be made from October 12-24, 2008, in conjunction with the AGU Chapman Conference  Atmospheric Water Vapor and its Role in Climate , which will be held in Kona, Hawaii. The opportunity for this project has emerged from recent discussions between the PIs and colleagues from industry, NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Université Libre de Bruxelles, and Service d'aéronomie in Paris. A number of important resources are being made available for this project at little or no cost to this grant. The timing seems to be fortuitous as several of the scientists involved are planning to be in Hawaii for the Chapman conference, and the other resources happen to be available at the same time. Intellectual Merit Measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues provide important information about the Earth?s hydrologic cycle, and new technologies promise to expand our understanding of the use and limitations of such measurements. The project will help to establish the foundation for climate studies using these new technologies by providing the first intercomparison between different ground and satellite-based techniques. The results of this study will be used to better understand optimal system configurations for climatological studies of water vapor isotopes and determine biases in emerging remote-sensing technologies. Moreover, the data from this project will help to constrain models of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle by providing the first continuous measurements of water isotopologues from an arid subtropical mid-ocean site. Broader Impacts The results of this intercomparison project will be important for the broader community of atmospheric water vapor isotope researchers as they begin to make use of the new array of remote sensing and laser-based techniques. The low humidity conditions atop Mauna Loa will test the limitations of the surface-based spectroscopic techniques and provide a sound footing for understanding the reliability of the instruments under extreme but climatologically important conditions. The results will be disseminated via publications and presentations at national conferences and will inform algorithm and instrument development in the United States and in Europe. The project will promote the training of graduate students by including them in the field program and data analysis. During the first week of the program, JPL scientists will make informal presentations to the students from University of New Mexico and Colorado University on water isotope measurement techniques and algorithms. During the second week of the program, the students will participate in the Chapman Conference, and the PIs will invite other graduate students attending the conference to join them in the field, either before the conference begins, or during the planned field excursion to the Mauna Loa Lab by conference attendees, which will also include a presentation about this project. In addition, this project will foster partnerships with industry (Picarro and Los Gatos) and with European colleagues associated with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer instrument NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Sulfur is an essential element in proteins, lipids, and some critical metabolites. The work proposed in this grant continues an exploration of the regulatory aspects of sulfur deprivation responses in the alga Chlamydomonas. Regulatory mutants aberrant for sulfur-deprivation responses and suppressor strains will be characterized to help identify interactions among signaling factors. Wild-type and various mutant strains will be queried with genome-wide methods for examining the transcriptome under nutrient-replete and sulfur-starvation conditions, using both microarray and Solexa sequencing technologies. Focused intellectual and technical efforts will be directed toward establishing more biochemical links between identified regulators. A diversity of protein-protein interaction assays, including the yeast two-hybrid system, the split ubiquitin and split GFP systems and the classical co-immunoprecipitation assays will facilitate these studies, providing strong insights into the regulatory circuits that control nutrient limitation responses in photosynthetic organisms. Finally, analyses will be performed to help understand the two tiers of the sulfur-deprivation response that have recently been discovered; one is protein synthesis-independent while the other is protein synthesis-dependent. In a broader sense, the proposed work will help untangle some of the complexities associated with the regulatory machinery that is required for photosynthetic cells to cope with deprivation conditions and ultimately help us understand the impact of sulfur compounds in our diets and on global weather patterns; some sulfur compounds strongly influence the quality and nutritional value of food while others have profound effects on the climate of the Earth. The project will train a post doctoral student and will involve collaboration with Dr. Charles Hauser and his undergraduate students at St. Edward's University, who will participate in summer exchange and in the analysis of microarray results. St. Edward's University is a minority serving institution NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Understanding the sensitivity of food systems to global change is limited by high uncertainties associated with the cross-scale interactions between the natural environment and the cultural landscape. Defining what might be within a suite of plausible futures requires a baseline scenario that captures the factors that are most significant in shaping decisions at different levels of governance, and which highlights the current, changing and interacting sensitivities of the system to stressors associated with both climate change and economic and cultural globalization. This project will create such a baseline by assessing the drivers and evolving social outcomes of one of the world's most important food systems: the Mexican maize system. Building on prior research that anticipates climate change will have negative impacts for Mexican maize production, and the globalization of agricultural markets is further challenging the future of maize in Mexico, an interdisciplinary team of social and biophysical scientists will investigate Mexican agricultural vulnerability in terms of a complex food system, in which individual decisions to plant or not to plant maize are hypothesized to manifest as landscape scale transformations. The research team also expects that global to regional price signals and climatic variability will affect local food production and land use outcomes differently across the Mexican landscape, as a function of regionally-specific cultural, economic, demographic, ecological and political factors. The project involves: a) a description of the changing national geography of maize production and the associated socioeconomic, institutional, and demographic correlates; b) an analysis of climate trends and variability as related to maize production, yields and water availability for irrigated farming; c) an econometric analysis of the spatial patterns of maize price volatility in three maize-producing states in order to evaluate the contribution of maize price volatility to farm-level risk and d) an evaluation of the drivers (e.g., prices and climate) and outcomes (land use, perceptions of food quality, and household maize expenditures) of maize abandonment / persistence at the farm-level through case studies in the states of Sinaloa, Mexico and Chiapas. A combination of approaches will be used, including exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), econometrics analysis (spatial, time-series, and spatial panels), agro-climatic analyses, and household livelihood surveys.This interdisciplinary and multi-method project involves experts in economic geography, econometrics, spatial analysis, livelihood assessment, climatology, agroecology and public policy in Mexico and the United States. It will provide the foundation for subsequent research on the development of scenarios of future social-ecological change and vulnerability of food security in Mexico. The project consolidates a strong international collaborative research community, involving Arizona State University, University of California Santa Barbara, the Colegio de Mexico (Mexico City), the Colegio de la Frontera Sur (Chiapas), and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP, Mexico City). The project aims to enhance this network throughout the project's implementation, by inviting Mexican experts external to the project to participate in part of the annual project coordination meetings to share their research and insights. Graduate students from the U.S. institutions will collaborate with research counterparts in Mexico. The approaches and findings from the project will be used as case material for graduate and undergraduate courses in earth system science, regional analysis, development economics and sustainable food systems. The diagnostic and analytical results of this project will be disseminated through a variety of forums to maize policy experts of the national agricultural secretary (SAGARPA), state agriculture ministries in Sinaloa, State of Mexico and Chiapas, non-governmental organizations interested in land use change and maize diversity, and to the academic communities in Mexico and the U.S. The project's results will also be disseminated to Mexican authorities responsible for climate change initiatives nationally in order to contribute to the efforts of these agencies to comply with international climate change agendas NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scambos/0732921Pettit/0732738Gordon/0732651Truffer/0732602Mosley-Thompson/0732655Like no other region on Earth, the northern Antarctic Peninsula represents a spectacular natural laboratory of climate change and provides the opportunity to study the record of past climate and ecological shifts alongside the present-day changes in one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula (AP). By making use of a marine research platform (the RV NB Palmer and on-board helicopters) and additional logistical support from the Argentine Antarctic program, the project will bring glaciologists, oceanographers, marine geologists and biologists together, working collaboratively to address fundamentally interdisciplinary questions regarding climate change.   The project will include gathering a new, high-resolution paleoclimate record from the Bruce Plateau of Graham Land, and using it to compare Holocene- and possibly glacial-epoch climate to the modern period; investigating the stability of the remaining Larsen Ice Shelf and rapid post-breakup glacier response ? in particular, the roles of surface melt and ice-ocean interactions in the speed-up and retreat; observing the contribution of, and response of, oceanographic systems to ice shelf disintegration and ice-glacier interactions.  Helicopter support on board will allow access to a wide range of glacial and geological areas of interest adjacent to the Larsen embayment. At these locations, long-term in situ glacial monitoring, isostatic uplift, and ice flow GPS sites will be established, and high-resolution ice core records will be obtained using previously tested lightweight drilling equipment. Long-term monitoring of deep water outflow will, for the first time, be integrated into changes in ice shelf extent and thickness, bottom water formation, and multi-level circulation by linking near-source observations to distal sites of concentrated outflow.  The broader impacts of this international, multidisciplinary effort are that it will significantly advance our understanding of linkages amongst the earth's systems in the Polar Regions, and are proposed with international participation (UK, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Argentina) and interdisciplinary engagement in the true spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY). It will also provide a means of engaging and educating the public in virtually all aspects of polar science and the effects of ongoing climate change. The research team has a long record of involving undergraduates in research, educating high-performing graduate students, and providing innovative and engaging outreach products to the K-12 education and public media forums. Moreover, forging the new links both in science and international Antarctic programs will provide a continuing legacy, beyond IPY, of improved understanding and cooperation in Antarctica NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Engineering - Other (59)The project supports a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders in the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) and Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Programs. The investigators are organizing poster sessions at the American Society for Engineering Education's (ASEE) Annual Conference in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The project invites engineering grant award recipients in CCLI and ATE to submit an abstract for inclusion in the poster session. Submissions are reviewed for quality and, if accepted, award recipients submit a paper that is published in the meeting proceedings and present a poster in a special session at the meeting NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The University of California Museum of Paleontology (UCMP) will bring together an experienced group of evolution educators in order to inform the development and maintenance of an effective resource for improving evolution education at the college level. This effort falls under the umbrella of UCMP's highly successful Understanding Evolution (UE) project (http://evolution.berkeley.edu), which currently receives over one million page requests per month during the school year. UE was originally designed around the needs of the K-12 education community; however, increasingly, the site is being used by the undergraduate education community. UCMP intends to embark on an effort to enhance the utility of the UE site for that population, increase awareness of the site at the college level, and secure the project's future so that it can continue to serve K-16 teachers and students. To inform and guide these efforts, UCMP proposes to establish and convene a UE Advisory Board, which will be charged with helping to: (1) identify the characteristics and needs of college-level target learners and their instructors with respect to evolution, (2) articulate the recommended components for expanding the UE site to include an Undergraduate Lounge in which students and their instructors will be able to access a variety of resources for increasing understanding of evolution, (3) develop a strategic plan for increasing awareness of UE within the undergraduate education community, and (4) develop a strategic plan for maintenance and continued growth of the UE site NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ADVANCES IN PHOTOMETRIC PRECISION FOR ALL-SKY EXOPLANET SURVEYS SUMMARY: MIT / Harvard-Smithsonian / Google / and NASA ARC are partners in a new initiative to discover more than 1000 new transiting exoplanets including several exoplanets comparable in siz NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project focuses on the study of DNA-protein complexes through single-DNA micromanipulation. Using magnetic tweezers and micropipette manipulation of DNAs attached to micron-sized particles, the dynamics of formation, mechanical properties, and catalytic function of nucleoprotein complexes will be measured. Self-assembly, activities and disassembly of these protein-DNA complexes will be studied via precise time-resolved measurement of mechanical properties, i.e. molecular lengths as a function of applied force. This simple yet versatile approach allows observation of kinetics of reactions as well as equilibrium states, for proteins that reorganize DNA structure. The project will also include development of transverse magnetic tweezer methods, including techniques for experiments on two DNA segments at once. Broader impacts of this research will be via its highly interdisciplinary nature, and by development of new biophysical techniques (transverse magnetic tweezer and combined magnetic tweezer/micropipette methods) for study of DNA-protein interactions. Along with this, the proposed activities will focus on research education for Ph.D. and postdoctoral students, combining physics and biology. Funding for this award is provided by the Division of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will support the postdoctoral research of Ofer Cohen at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  Dr. Cohen will investigate the role of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the long-term evolution of the solar magnetic field and the solar cycle.  Since the detailed mechanism causing solar open field reversal is unknown, the Principal Investigator (PI) will numerically test the hypothesis that interchange reconnection of CMEs with the ambient open magnetic flux can lead to the destruction of coronal holes and the reversal of the Sun's open magnetic field.  Using MHD simulations, Dr. Cohen and his team will investigate how magnetic flux emerges through the solar surface and then is transferred by CMEs to reconnect with, and to modify, the background magnetic field. The long-term evolution of the solar magnetic field and the solar cycle are important for predicting space weather.  Understanding the behavior of CMEs and their propagation is also required in order to develop predictive tools. The PI anticipates that this research on CMEs will shed light on the long-term effect of CMEs on the solar magnetic field and on the effect of the ambient field on CME propagation.  This work addresses SHINE objectives to understand the processes by which energy is produced by the Sun and by which particles are accelerated in interplanetary space, as well as to study the mechanisms by which fields and particles are transported to the Earth through the inner heliosphere.  The PI will undertake active modeling of the solar corona and the space environment NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In recent years, mountain pine beetle outbreaks in western North America have been startling in both their speed and extent; in Colorado alone, more than 600,000 hectares have been infected since the late 1990s.  Yet, our understanding of how both ecosystems and humans react to such outbreaks, and how such responses alter critical ecosystem services, remains poor.  This research involves both natural and social scientists and will take advantage of a unique opportunity to collect pre-infection data at the Niwot Ridge Long-Term Ecological Research site just prior to a pine beetle invasion that is virtually certain to occur.  Data to be collected include not only those on ecosystem responses, but also on public and policy reactions to the outbreak in the Colorado Front Range region.The broader impacts of an integrated study on human and ecosystem responses to pine beetle outbreaks are considerable.  The work will directly address a phenomenon that has the attention of the highest levels of government in the western U.S. and Canada, where states and provinces are scrambling to enact new management policies in the wake of large-scale beetle kills.  This work will also contribute key scientific understanding to the debates on pine beetle management plans NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Misconception Oriented Standards-based Assessment Resource for Teachers in Life Science (MOSART-LS) project develops rigorous Distractor Driven Multiple Choice assessment tools that aid in generating evidence-based measures of MSP projects' impact on K-8 teachers' life science subject-matter knowledge and relevant pedagogical content knowledge. The National Research Council's (NRC's) Science Standards and AAAS Science Benchmarks serve as a framework for the grade-appropriate content that teachers are expected to master. This work utilizes peer-reviewed research studies of student conceptions in order to generate specialized assessments.  These assessments measure the degree to which teachers hold the accepted scientific view represented by each of the 31 K-8 Content Standards in life science. The project is developing 250 valid new items and gathering data from a nationally representative sample of 8000 students and their teachers, characterizing the content knowledge of both. Subsets of test items are organized into instruments and validated by content experts. When added to the existing test item bank developed as part of earlier efforts that focused on physical science and earth/space science, these new life science items also allow for the construction of  general science  instruments to measure the concepts taught across all NRC content standards at the K-4 and 5-8 grade bands. Incorporation of these tests into the MOSART online assessment system will make administration easier and allow for the aggregation of data from participating MSPs.The application of psychometric models aligned with cognitive research findings are used to establish scales and subtests that accurately gauge the scientific understanding needed for teaching elementary school and middle school life science. These instruments are useful for diagnostic purposes, ascertaining the strengths and weaknesses of participants prior to professional development. By adding a post-test administration, changes in teacher knowledge can be measured and characterized. The project is a direct outgrowth of the proposer's earlier efforts including the video  A Private Universe  and MOSART NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intelligent Merit: This study will examine and clarify for policymakers and researchers the impact of statewide policy changes that increased the availability of advanced STEM courses for a greater number of schools and students.  The proposer will analyze the extent to which the policy changes affect outcomes for all students, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM areas.  This study, then, will provide critical information about the effectiveness of policy changes for stakeholders who have a vested interest in understanding the effects of advanced curricular programs on student enrollment in STEM courses during high school and early college.  The project will address two key research questions: 1. Who enrolls in accelerated academic programs?  What are the factors (the student and school) that influence enrollment in different accelerated and non-accelerated curricular programs? 2. Do accelerated academic programs increase students? STEM coursetaking in high school and during their first year of postsecondary school (Grade 13)?  Do some programs increase STEM coursetaking more than others?  Do these programs reduce gaps in STEM coursetaking among historically underrepresented students and their peers?The proposer will use a mixed method approach to address the research questions that includes a quantitative analysis of extant longitudinal data in the state of Florida and a qualitative assessment of non-statistical factors through site visits to schools.  Ten years of quantitative data from the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) will serve as the main source of information the proposer will use to study the characteristics of both students and schools.  The FLDOE dataset includes a rich array of high school and postsecondary data (e.g. transcripts; dual enrollment and achievement data in these courses; regular 1-12 grades school test scores; demographic data; poverty index information).  Two sets of school site visits will be conducted in the state?s major urban centers as well as small suburban high schools to provide insights not captured through quantitative analysis.  During the initial visits, data will be collected via course catalogs and interviews with school personnel.  For follow-up visits, data will be collected through student focus groups about all aspects of course offerings and course taking.  Broader Impacts: Contribution to the field of knowledge about student enrollment in advanced STEM coursework will likely advance discovery in this area.  The extensiveness of the work (examination of student and school factors from high school to college in mathematics and science) increases the importance of results to local and national policymakers and researchers. The wide range of expertise (individuals and institutions) adds significantly to the strength of the proposal and increases the credibility of expected outcomes.  Lessons-learned from prior work will serve as the foundation for the development of some of the study?s data collection instruments. The dissemination plan is strong and the Urban Institute appears well positioned to carry out this component of the scope of work NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This planning project by the National Academy of Sciences is the first step toward their establishment of a new initiative on helping the public become more knowledgeable about and engaged with the science of energy and energy choices.  The Energy Ambassador program would eventually work around the country with several local civic/business/community leaders to provide them with a solid foundation for understanding the science of energy-related issues and provide them with a solid foundation for understanding the science of energy-related issues and developing possible strategies in their communities for public engagement and decision-making.  The planning work is prelude to a pilot study and then to a major roll-out if all indicators suggest that would be successful.  The planning work will convene scienctists, policy makers, educators, and media to develop the details for the pilot study, including indentifying three cities where the pilot study could take place and the science ambassadors for these.  The activity will be in collaboration with the NAS's Committee on Learning Science in Informal Environments and the staff of the Board of Science Education NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Human civilizations have developed during the Holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. The Holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. However, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the Holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history.Although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of Holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. Holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. Glaciers in many areas on Earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the Holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. The age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental Holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking.Recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the Holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of Holocene climate changes. This grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the Holocene moraine sequences in New Zealand?s Southern Alps by applying high-precision 10Be surface exposure dating (SED) combined with local calibration of the 10Be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. New Zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different Holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the Holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?Little Ice Age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our SED approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of New Zealand?s Southern Alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on Earth. To achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the Southern Alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. We will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from New Zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the Holocene glacial pulse-beat. One of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?Little Ice Age, where detailed historical records are available for European glaciers.Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: We expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of Holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: Were Holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric? Were atmospheric circulation changes involved in driving these events or were both, global and regional forces involved? This project represents a unique opportunity to create a reference data set of Holocene glacial fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes. These data should be of high value to calibrate climate models and to the broad community of climate scientists and glacial geologists. We further develop the method of cosmogenic 10Be dating and our geochemical/geochronological tool-kit will be applicable to future Holocene moraine-dating projects. The new atlas of geomorphic maps of the central Southern Alps will be updated with our glacial chronologies during this project.In addition to extending the LDEO/CU curriculum, a female master student will be educated, several early-career scientists will be involved, and high school students and teachers (?Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program?) will actively participate in this project. Beyond standard data dissemination, we will present the project at public events, such as the annual L-DEO Open House (typically 4,000 visitors) and will use our close contacts to New York public media to seek coverage of this project in newspapers (New York Times) and television (History Channel). The project will foster the fruitful collaboration between the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the University of Maine, the UC Berkeley, and the GNS Science, NZ NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The organization of movement is a complex and difficult problem, in part because of a  degrees of freedom problem  in motor control. The richness of an animal's movement possibilities makes its choice of movement controls complex.  However, unlike current robots, animals cope efficiently with their degrees of freedom. A newborn wildebeest calf walks with the herd within a few hours of birth. A frog or a turtle, using just its spinal cord, can control complex goal-directed trajectories. The spinal cord can also rapidly correct such movements if they are perturbed. It has been argued that these remarkable capacities are modular, constructed with small sets of primitives or motor building blocks. How such primitives arise and are used is the focus of this project.The concepts of modularity and motor primitives have provided useful descriptions of the organization of spinal motor systems. Modular organization has been shown to support spinal behaviors, and may help to  bootstrap  motor learning. Nonetheless, modularity is controversial at many levels. Spinal primitives might need to be supplanted or augmented in order to perform complex, voluntary behaviors. This project attacks this problem in frog prey strike behaviors, a voluntary and adapted behavior in a system that is fundamentally important to the animal, and has also been well characterized in previous studies of modularity.  The neuromechanics of prey strike is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The importance of modular organization in neuroscience and behavior extends well beyond biological motor control, with ramifications in evolutionary and cognitive psychology. Biological strategies and solutions are also highly relevant to future technologies and robotics.A computer model of prey strike will be developed using a novel approach based on Cosserat strand-elements. The model will be developed by a team of four investigators: Simon Giszter (neurophysiology) and Jonathan Nissanov (anatomy, imaging) at Drexel University, Dinesh Pai (computer science, biomechanical modeling) at the University of British Columbia, and Kiisa Nishikawa  (neuromechanics) at Northern Arizona University. Cryoplane microscopy will be used to reconstruct bullfrog sensorimotor anatomy in detail. These structures will be modeled using a strand-based approach to incorporate this detail.  Experimental and model analyses of prey strike using these data will inform one another to establish the benefits and limits of fixed or adaptive modular mechanisms, and the biological implementation used in frogs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This CAREER project will build an education and research program in methodology for process monitoring, fault identification, and fault diagnosis using high-dimensional functional data or image sensor signals.  Due to the massive amount and high dimensionality of image and functional data, the analysis and manipulation required to obtain timely synthesized information for quality improvement becomes complicated and resource intensive. The proposed methods will integrate wavelet-based signal-processing techniques and system-modeling procedures oriented to data mining to develop an in-process (or in-situ) control tool for manufacturing processes. The proposed methodology includes the following:  (1) an adaptive multi-scale monitoring model for functional data or image sensor signals to overcome the problem of the low fault detection probability present in existing techniques; (2) a kernel-based fault identification index measure and a variable selection algorithm to identify contributing process variables to improve diagnostic performance; (3) a nonlinear fault diagnosis model to determine an assignable cause for a fault and to effectively handle ill-posed autocorrelated functional data or image sensor signals.The results of this research will provide manufacturers with new tools for handling high-dimensional functional data or image sensor signals for quality improvement of their manufacturing processes. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it is generic and can be adapted to other research and application areas, such as in the monitoring of nonlinear profiles, the problem of large-scale sensor failure detection, and variable selection problems of spectrum data, or in the development of new research issues related to nonlinear multivariate SPC in bioprocesses, semiconductor and automobile manufacturing, and other manufacturing processes NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A JOINT XMM-NEWTON, GLAST, MAGIC, VERITAS BROADBAND OBSERVATION CAMPAIGN OF ONE HIGH-ENERGY BLAZAR IN A MAJOR OUTBURST- The main objective of the proposed work is to perform one very intense observational campaign at X-ray / GeV / and TeV energies of one NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER NANOMATERIALS BASED SENSORS AND ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES The proposed Virginia State University project consists of research and education activities to be performed at the NASA Langley Research Center as well as the University. These activities are desi NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Computer security is a field in which defenses are pitted against adversaries.  Thus, it is critical to understand the capabilities and motivations of the adversary if one is to plan effective defenses.  However, modern Internet-based attacks are largely driven by economic factors that are only understood in the abstract.  While we know that it is sufficiently cheap to compromise Internet hosts that large-scale botnets have become a compelling platform for launching attacks, we simply do not understand the scale of the revenue that that such activities bring in.  While we understand that billions of spam e-mails are sent per day, the conversion rate of this spam ? the probability that a sent message will result in a ?sale? ? is largely unknown.  Absent such information it is difficult to reason about the structural nature of the conflict between attackers and defenders.Traditionally, obtaining information about the critical economic factors in Internet attacks is difficult because such information is only visible to the attacker themselves.  Our research is focused on sidestepping this issue by infiltrating the technical infrastructure ? the botnets themselves ? used by Internet miscreants.  Our technique, called ?distribution infiltration? provides a means to directly quantify key aspects of spam and phishing campaigns as well as to measure the impact of defenses on an economic footing (i.e., their impact on the profitability of e-crime).  Our research will both refine these methodologies and produce concrete data for developing economic-based threat models of computer security NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Engineering - Other (59)The project aims to explore the impacts of project-based service learning (PBSL) on engineering education. Central to this study is a summit on the measurement of these impacts with twenty leaders in engineering PBSL and assessment attending. Equally important to the study is the creation of a pre-summit report on the state of PBSL in engineering education with an emphasis on evaluation. This document, a synthesis of evidence in the literature and information from summit participants, provides a broad review of existing PBSL programs, their impacts, and the assessment methods used in studying them. The summit agenda is designed to identify desired outcome metrics, quality assessment methods, and key next steps needed in understanding the impacts of PBSL on engineering education. The pre-summit and summit findings are being combined into a nationally disseminated final report and presented in several conference presentations NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the transport and fate of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in watersheds. We address three novel questions which have not been studied previously: (a) what is the relative influence of terrestrial versus aquatic (in-stream) sources/sinks on DON and bioavailable (BDON) dynamics at various points along the drainage path? (b) how do DON and BDON exports vary with catchment scale? and (c) how do DON dynamics differ from DOC and what mechanisms are responsible for these differences? We address these questions across varying temporal scales from baseflow to storm events and across seasons. Contributions of DON from various catchment sources are expected to change dramatically between baseflow and storm-event conditions while seasonal changes can especially influence BDON. Catchment sources investigated include ? precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, forest floor, hillslope soil water, wetland soil and ground water, groundwater seeps, hyporheic zone, and streamflow. We will not only investigate how the amounts of DON in various catchment sources influence DON export, but also investigate how the mobility (adsorption-desorption kinetics) and lability of various dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents (e.g., hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions) regulate DON export. Special attention is given to differences in DON and DOC responses in light of hydrologic flow paths, storm event magnitude and seasonal timing, antecedent catchment wetness, and redox conditions. We address these questions across zero- to third-order forested catchments of the Big Elk Creek in NE Maryland, which are representative of Piedmont catchments in the mid-Atlantic region. The catchments have already been intensively instrumented, and preliminary data from the site is available since March 2007. We will implement end member mixing analysis (EMMA) at multiple points in the catchments to characterize the spatial pattern of runoff sources and DON contributions. Innovative, new, spectrofluorometric tools such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) are used to characterize DOM composition including an in-situ logging fluorometer. A strong interdisciplinary team of scientists with diverse strengths but complimentary interests will evaluate the questions. We anticipate that this study will result in the first conceptual model of DON that characterizes the relative influences of terrestrial and instream processes across various catchment scales.Results from this study will have direct practical implications for: (a) drinking water research since DON contributes to the formation of toxic disinfection by-products; and (b) nutrient enrichment of coastal estuaries (e.g., Chesapeake bay) since DON is bioavailable. An on-line data archive will be created to disseminate the data and results from this study. This data archive will be linked through the web site of the Center for Critical Zone (CCZ) at the University of Delaware and the Delaware Water Resources Center (DWRC). Dissemination of fact sheets to practitioners in regional offices of the US Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Forest Service, US EPA, and Maryland?s Forest Service should broaden the impact of the proposed research. The instrumented watershed will be (is being) used as a ?demonstration? and educational watershed laboratory. This will enable us to develop new interdisciplinary partnerships with other scientists and students within and outside UD. This project will provide valuable interdisciplinary research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students from the Bioresources Engineering, Geology, Plant and Soil Sciences, and Geography Departments. Under-represented groups will be actively recruited by the PI and Co-PI?s with the intention of filling two or more undergraduate and graduate assistantships. A female graduate student will be the PhD student on this project. The final outreach component of this project will involve the Fair Hill Nature Center and its experienced staff of environmental and experiential education teachers. The Fair Hill Nature Center is a non-profit entity, educating k-8 students about responsible environmental stewardship. The Fair Hill Nature Center educates over 8,000 school children annually. PIs on this project will be actively involved with the teachers and staff of the Fair Hill Nature Center staff to provide educational seminars on watersheds, soils, and forests and will participate in student field trips to the instrumented watershed NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The goal of the proposed work is to provide an improved understanding of snow depth ? climate relationships and the physical mechanisms involved. An extensive body of scientific literature describes the linkages between snow extent anomalies and climate, but snow extent alone does not tell the whole story. Variations in snow depth, which do not necessarily coincide with variations in snow extent, may have a distinct and considerable impact on climate over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Recently completed research by the PI clearly distinguishes the climatic significance of snow depth, and complements the somewhat limited existing literature on snow depth ? climate linkages. This serves as motivation for this proposal to identify the responsible mechanisms.The snow depth - climate relationship is likely to be very complicated, and involve different dynamic and thermodynamic processes across varying spatial domains and scales. Some facets of this overall relationship are better understood than others, while still other facets may benefit from updated analyses using more recent data and/or modeling resources. Therefore the proposed work will specifically target two aspects of the overall snow depth ? climate relationship where our current state of understanding is incomplete. Two hypotheses are investigated, the first involving a remote climatic cause for snow depth variability over North America, and the second involving a local climatic consequence of snow depth variability.A key resource for this proposal is a newly released, long-term, gridded, daily snow depth dataset covering all of North America (Dyer and Mote 2006). Its availability offers exciting new opportunities to study snow depth and its interactions with climate, especially in northern regions of North America where snow depth information has historically been lacking but is expected to vary considerably. Hence this frequently neglected parameter can be empirically evaluated over a broader domain than previously was possible. Furthermore, snow depth perturbation experiments will be performed using both a one-dimensional snowpack model and a regional climate model, to comprehensively evaluate the thermodynamic and near-surface dynamic processes associated with anomalous snow depth.Diagnosing specific climatic causes and consequences of snow depth variability, rather than an exploratory and unfocused study of the overall relationships, hold the strongest prospects for success and impact within the hydrologic and climate science communities. Recognition of snow depth as an important contributor to climate variations will promote continued improvements in the still relatively crude snow parameterizations in climate models, and also in snow depth remote sensing techniques. The concept of distinct snow depth and snow extent linkages will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of snow ? climate relationships, and provide new information to help identify additional regions/seasons which may hold some predictive capability for climate. This in turn would have far-reaching societal benefits for water resource management, hazard mitigation and anthropogenic climate change.The proposed research will be managed to maximize its broader impacts on education. Despite its focused scope and relatively modest budget, the project will support three students at dramatically different stages of their educational career. An existing doctoral candidate at the PI?s institution will complete her dissertation, and ensure a smooth and efficient transition to a new doctoral student for the duration of this project. Furthermore, one high school student at New York City?s prestigious Bronx High School of Science will be sponsored, whose research on this project will be entered in the Intel Science Talent Search competition (http://www.sciserv.org/Sts/). Such early exposure to research can inspire students to pursue careers in science and engineering, and foster the development of the next generation of researchers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THE EURASIAN FRESHWATER CYCLE FROM GRACE AND IN-S ITU HYDROLOGIC NETWORKS: DISTINGUISHING WATER CYCLE BEHAVIOR IN PERMAFROST AND NON-PERMAFROST REGIONS- We propose to use monthly values of time-variable gravity from GRACE in combination with runoff / prec NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Human civilizations have developed during the Holocene epoch that began approximately 11,500 years ago. The Holocene is classically considered a period of outstanding climate stability. However, recent paleoclimate records suggest that abrupt climatic shifts did occur within the Holocene and that some of those coincided with twists and turns in human history. Although directly influencing human habitat, temporal and spatial patterns, natural variability and driving mechanisms of Holocene climate are not well understood, hampering reliable evaluation of current climate change. Holocene climate swings were large enough to impact humans but small enough to get lost in the ?noise? of natural variability in most geological climate records. Glaciers in many areas on Earth, however, have responded sensitively and quickly to the Holocene climate changes and have produced distinctive landforms, or moraines. The age of these landforms directly indicates when these continental Holocene climate changes occurred, but so far a robust, uniform and reliable dating tool for moraines was lacking. Recent progress in the field of cosmogenic dating demonstrates that moraines can be dated with unprecedented accuracy throughout the Holocene period, allowing novel perspectives on the characteristics of Holocene climate changes. This grant is an interdisciplinary, multi-group effort to date the Holocene moraine sequences in New Zealand?s Southern Alps by applying high-precision 10Be surface exposure dating (SED) combined with local calibration of the 10Be production rate, to evaluate the underlying climate changes, and to analyze the results within an interhemispheric perspective. New Zealand appears to be an ideal location for such a study: (i) terrestrial paleoclimate data from southern mid-latitudes, influenced by tropical and polar signals, are sparse and urgently needed to evaluate the regional footprint of climate changes; (ii) up to five or more different Holocene moraines are preserved in front of individual glaciers, allowing insight into the details of the Holocene climate changes in southern mid-latitudes, including the ?Little Ice Age?; (iii) glaciers in southern mid-latitudes respond to atmospheric/oceanic changes (no continental climate effects); (iv) the general landform setting and rock type is well suited for our SED approach; (v) a suite of detailed glacier landform (geomorphologic) maps of New Zealand?s Southern Alps have been developed, paleo-snowlines have been reconstructed in detail, and glaciological modeling studies are ongoing by our collaborators, making this one of the better investigated glacier records on Earth. To achieve a regional, detailed chronology of glaciations on a prime site in southern mid-latitudes, we will combine large valley glacier systems with smaller valley glaciers on both, the semi-arid east flank as well as on the very humid west flank of the Southern Alps, evaluating the importance of different precipitation regimes for glaciations. We will compare our glacial chronologies to the few records available from New Zealand and elsewhere, testing the regional to inter-hemispheric character of the Holocene glacial pulse-beat. One of the foci herein will be the time period known as the ?Little Ice Age, where detailed historical records are available for European glaciers. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: We expect to greatly improve our understanding of drivers of Holocene glacier fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes by tackling key questions such as: Were Holocene glaciations inter-hemispheric? Were atmospheric circulation changes involved in driving these events or were both, global and regional forces involved? This project represents a unique opportunity to create a reference data set of Holocene glacial fluctuations in southern mid-latitudes. These data should be of high value to calibrate climate models and to the broad community of climate scientists and glacial geologists. We further develop the method of cosmogenic 10Be dating and our geochemical/geochronological tool-kit will be applicable to future Holocene moraine-dating projects. The new atlas of geomorphic maps of the central Southern Alps will be updated with our glacial chronologies during this project. In addition to extending the LDEO/CU curriculum, a female master student will be educated, several early-career scientists will be involved, and high school students and teachers (?Lamont-Doherty Secondary School Field Program?) will actively participate in this project. Beyond standard data dissemination, we will present the project at public events, such as the annual L-DEO Open House (typically 4,000 visitors) and will use our close contacts to New York public media to seek coverage of this project in newspapers (New York Times) and television (History Channel). The project will foster the fruitful collaboration between the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the University of Maine, the UC Berkeley, and the GNS Science, NZ NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Topology and Geometry of Physics Conference will be held at Texas Tech University on October 23-25, 2008. The  conference will showcase five established researchers and seven additional speakers. They will give talks related to quantization problems, quantum topology, the quantum Teichmueller space, noncommutative geometry, and applications of quantum physics to algebraic geometry. The main idea of the conference is to demonstrate deep connections between mathematics and physics. The participants will be exposed to a wide range of methods and results from different fields of investigation. The conference will also  give a number of early career researchers the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER FROM BEANS TO GENES: A FORTY YEAR ODYSSEY IN RADIATION BIOLOGY We request NASA support to organize and host an international conference at Columbia University in New York to critically assess the cellular and molecular signaling events and tissue response NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ISPI CASSINI - INSTANTANEOUS STELLAR PARALLAX INVESTIGATION VIA CASSINI- We propose a novel technique / ISPI (INSTANTANEOUS STELLAR PARALLAX INVESTIGATION) / to measure distances to astrophysical sources using a combination of Cassini in the Saturn system NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Last Modified Date:  08/01/08  Last Modified By:  Kenneth C. Whang      Abstract The organization of movement is a complex and difficult problem, in part because of a  degrees of freedom problem  in motor control. The richness of an animal's movement possibilities makes its choice of movement controls complex. However, unlike current robots, animals cope efficiently with their degrees of freedom. A newborn wildebeest calf walks with the herd within a few hours of birth. A frog or a turtle, using just its spinal cord, can control complex goal-directed trajectories. The spinal cord can also rapidly correct such movements if they are perturbed. It has been argued that these remarkable capacities are modular, constructed with small sets of primitives or motor building blocks. How such primitives arise and are used is the focus of this project. The concepts of modularity and motor primitives have provided useful descriptions of the organization of spinal motor systems. Modular organization has been shown to support spinal behaviors, and may help to  bootstrap  motor learning. Nonetheless, modularity is controversial at many levels. Spinal primitives might need to be supplanted or augmented in order to perform complex, voluntary behaviors. This project attacks this problem in frog prey strike behaviors, a voluntary and adapted behavior in a system that is fundamentally important to the animal, and has also been well characterized in previous studies of modularity. The neuromechanics of prey strike is examined from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The importance of modular organization in neuroscience and behavior extends well beyond biological motor control, with ramifications in evolutionary and cognitive psychology. Biological strategies and solutions are also highly relevant to future technologies and robotics. A computer model of prey strike will be developed using a novel approach based on Cosserat strand-elements. The model will be developed by a team of four investigators: Simon Giszter (neurophysiology) and Jonathan Nissanov (anatomy, imaging) at Drexel University, Dinesh Pai (computer science, biomechanical modeling) at the University of British Columbia, and Kiisa Nishikawa (neuromechanics) at Northern Arizona University. Cryoplane microscopy will be used to reconstruct bullfrog sensorimotor anatomy in detail. These structures will be modeled using a strand-based approach to incorporate this detail. Experimental and model analyses of prey strike using these data will inform one another to establish the benefits and limits of fixed or adaptive modular mechanisms, and the biological implementation used in frogs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER An award has been made to Harvard University under the direction of Dr. Anne Pringle to study the symbiosis of fungi and woody plants.  The grant will improve the doctoral dissertation research of Benjamin Wolfe.  Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations on the surface of woody plant roots.  This symbiosis benefits the plant by enhancing water and mineral absorption, and it provides the fungi with a source of nutrients from the plant.  These symbioses have evolved multiple times throughout the mushroom forming fungi.  However, ecological and genomic changes in the fungi in these symbioses remain poorly understood.  This work will use the genus Amanita, a genus that includes many toxic species and includes both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic species of fungi.  A molecular phylogeny of 200 Amanita species will be constructed to determine the number of times symbiosis has evolved in Amanita.  To examine how the evolution of symbiosis affects resource acquisition, stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen will be measured for Amanita species.  The structure of functional genes and estimates of genome size will be used to assess genomic changes associated with the evolution of symbiosis. This project will provide insight on the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, an economically and ecologically important symbiosis in forest ecosystems.  This work will also directly contribute to the training of a Ph.D. student, provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, and foster collaborations between university research labs, citizen scientists, and science educators NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the transport and fate of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in watersheds. We address three novel questions which have not been studied previously: (a) what is the relative influence of terrestrial versus aquatic (in-stream) sources/sinks on DON and bioavailable (BDON) dynamics at various points along the drainage path? (b) how do DON and BDON exports vary with catchment scale? and (c) how do DON dynamics differ from DOC and what mechanisms are responsible for these differences? We address these questions across varying temporal scales from baseflow to storm events and across seasons. Contributions of DON from various catchment sources are expected to change dramatically between baseflow and storm-event conditions while seasonal changes can especially influence BDON. Catchment sources investigated include ? precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, forest floor, hillslope soil water, wetland soil and ground water, groundwater seeps, hyporheic zone, and streamflow. We will not only investigate how the amounts of DON in various catchment sources influence DON export, but also investigate how the mobility (adsorption-desorption kinetics) and lability of various dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents (e.g., hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions) regulate DON export. Special attention is given to differences in DON and DOC responses in light of hydrologic flow paths, storm event magnitude and seasonal timing, antecedent catchment wetness, and redox conditions. We address these questions across zero- to third-order forested catchments of the Big Elk Creek in NE Maryland, which are representative of Piedmont catchments in the mid-Atlantic region. The catchments have already been intensively instrumented, and preliminary data from the site is available since March 2007. We will implement end member mixing analysis (EMMA) at multiple points in the catchments to characterize the spatial pattern of runoff sources and DON contributions. Innovative, new, spectrofluorometric tools such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) are used to characterize DOM composition including an in-situ logging fluorometer. A strong interdisciplinary team of scientists with diverse strengths but complimentary interests will evaluate the questions. We anticipate that this study will result in the first conceptual model of DON that characterizes the relative influences of terrestrial and instream processes across various catchment scales.Results from this study will have direct practical implications for: (a) drinking water research since DON contributes to the formation of toxic disinfection by-products; and (b) nutrient enrichment of coastal estuaries (e.g., Chesapeake bay) since DON is bioavailable. An on-line data archive will be created to disseminate the data and results from this study. This data archive will be linked through the web site of the Center for Critical Zone (CCZ) at the University of Delaware and the Delaware Water Resources Center (DWRC). Dissemination of fact sheets to practitioners in regional offices of the US Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Forest Service, US EPA, and Maryland?s Forest Service should broaden the impact of the proposed research. The instrumented watershed will be (is being) used as a ?demonstration? and educational watershed laboratory. This will enable us to develop new interdisciplinary partnerships with other scientists and students within and outside UD. This project will provide valuable interdisciplinary research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students from the Bioresources Engineering, Geology, Plant and Soil Sciences, and Geography Departments. Under-represented groups will be actively recruited by the PI and Co-PI?s with the intention of filling two or more undergraduate and graduate assistantships. A female graduate student will be the PhD student on this project. The final outreach component of this project will involve the Fair Hill Nature Center and its experienced staff of environmental and experiential education teachers. The Fair Hill Nature Center is a non-profit entity, educating k-8 students about responsible environmental stewardship. The Fair Hill Nature Center educates over 8,000 school children annually. PIs on this project will be actively involved with the teachers and staff of the Fair Hill Nature Center staff to provide educational seminars on watersheds, soils, and forests and will participate in student field trips to the instrumented watershed NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Layer-8 attacks (e.g., spam and phishing) are launched from a malicious service platform, e.g., botnet, which consists of a large number of infected machines (or bots). Such an attack platform relies on lower-layer network services to achieve efficiency, robustness, and stealth in communication and attack activities. These services include look-up (e.g., DNS), hosting (e.g., Web servers), and transport (e.g., BGP).The main research goals and approaches of the CLEANSE project are:         1. Control-plane monitoring. Much of the infrastructure for mounting layer-8 attacks involves abuse of the control plane in core network services (e.g., DNS and BGP).The CLEANSE project develops control-plane anomaly detection sensors that are distributed, online, and real-time.         2. Data-plane monitoring. The project develops new and general network anomaly detection algorithms based on traffic sampling and clustering for monitoring high-speed traffic.         3. Improved security auditing capabilities. The CLEANSE project develops packet  tagging/tainting  techniques to enable tracking and clustering of network traffic flows (e.g., that are generated by the same bot program). The project also develops improved traffic sampling capabilities that are attack-aware and distributed network-wide.By focusing on monitoring of core network services, the CLEANSE framework can detect future layer-8 attacks and new forms of large-scale malware infections. The project also creates educational contents, including new textbooks and on-line course materials, which directly benefit from the research activities. The CLEANSE project team also work with industry partners (including the ISPs) to organize focused workshops that bring together researchers from academia and practitioners from the industry/ISP, government, and law enforcement agencies to foster the exchange of ideas, data, and technologies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER An important kind of virtual research organization is the project-based research collaboration involving researchers from different institutions. The project provides a scientific grounding for managing, evaluating, and predicting success in distributed research collaborations. Collaborative success depends on whether investigators have a productive climate: a social and technical context that supports performance and innovation. In a productive climate, collaborators perceive they have resources to collaborate effectively; they see a link between their achievements and rewards they receive; they experience their group as flexible and welcoming of innovative approaches; and they note minimal conflict between the collaboration and their career and their institution's values. The research defines and measures a productive climate of distributed research collaborations and focuses on a key antecedent of a productive climate: the institutional environment of the collaboration. One example of this kind of environment is whether the institutions that employ the investigators see exceptional value in interdisciplinary research and have developed practices that support this kind of research.The investigators study the institutional environments of a sample of projects that were supported by the National Science Foundation. The intellectual contribution of this work includes documenting the importance of a productive climate for distributed research collaboration, and tracing the linkages among productive climate and the institutional environments of these collaborations. This analysis led to better metrics for measuring and predicting performance and innovation in collaborations. Identifying the institutional factors that predict the productive climate and outcomes of research collaborations also permit the development of models to predict which collaborations are likely to be successful. The broader impacts of this project are to inform university, agency, and regulatory practices and policies for science and new forms of interdisciplinary, distributed research collaboration NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit This project builds on exciting new findings from current work at Tufts University under an NSF/NIRT grant, in which we have collected significant evidence pointing to atomic dispersions of gold and platinum in ceria, and gold in iron oxide, as the catalytic sites for the water gas shift reaction (WGS). We followed activity loss with gold cluster growth in ceria matrices and identified conditions that stabilize gold growth. We have shown that addition of small amounts of oxygen can be used to stabilize Au- or Pt-CeO2 shift catalysts at all temperatures and in cyclic start up/ shutdown operation in realistic fuel gas streams. We have further demonstrated a strong shape/crystal face/strain effect of ceria on the WGS activity of Au/ceria by using single ceria crystals at the nanoscale prepared by controlled hydrothermal synthesis, which can be tested at normal pressures in flow reactor systems. Moreover, this project builds on new, important theoretical findings from the University of Wisconsin that certain pairs of metals examined as surface or near surface alloys possess much improved activity as PEM cathode electrocatalysts. The unique capability in high-resolution STM/STS of one of the Tufts co-PIs will open a new avenue of investigation that connects atomic-level composition and electronic properties with the surface chemistry of these model catalysts. In the proposed work, we will extend the study of atomic dispersions of metals to other oxides, such as zirconia and zinc oxide, both prepared by novel synthesis routes as nano rods, cubes, polyhedra, etc. exposing specific crystal planes on which to deposit and study metals and metal alloys. The WGS and methanol steam reforming (MSR) processes will be the reactions of interest to probe structure sensitivity with the support. Metals and near surface metal alloys from the group of Au, Cu, Pd, and Pt, will be examined. A new combinatorial approach to rank order alloy metal reactivity is proposed, whereby nanoalloy tips pressed on thin oxides-on-thermocouple junctions will be constructed in arrays and thermoelectric response will be used to monitor adsorption/reaction on the nanoalloys. A rational approach to the synthesis and evaluation of novel catalysts for WGS and MSR is proposed to complement and guide the catalysis work. Thus, STM/STS studies and computational chemistry are center-stage in the project. We will also make use of the XAS capabilities at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) through our collaborators there. Our overall goal in the project is to elucidate the metal-oxide and the metal-metal interactions responsible for redox reactions of interest to fuel reforming for hydrogen generation and pave the way for the design of the next generation of WGS and MSR catalysts. Broader Impacts We propose to undertake a systematic, multidisciplinary research effort to investigate the atomic-level interaction of Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd with ceria, zirconia, or zinc oxide for two reactions of interest to the production of hydrogen for fuel cells; namely, the water-gas shift and methanol steam reforming reactions. Knowledge garnered from these systems has both mechanistic and practical implications for other closely related reactions of importance to clean energy, including the processing of other oxygenates derived from fossil fuels or biomass. An interdisciplinary team of experts from Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at Tufts, Chemical Engineering at the Wisconsin, and Chemistry at BNL, has been assembled for this project. At the end of the interdisciplinary effort, we will have answered key questions on the activity and selectivity of atomically dispersed metals, metal clusters, and supported surface alloys on nanoparticles of ceria, zirconia, or zinc oxide, and be in a position to provide rational designs for practical catalyst preparation. These materials will be used in fuel and biofuel processing, and as anode catalysts and films for fuel cell applications. Thus, the impact of these findings will lead to better power systems design. There are several other tangible benefits for each of the disciplines involved here: new methods for catalyst synthesis, new materials properties specific to the nanoscale of importance to sensors, fuel cell components, and to catalysts; and new catalyst designs for low-cost fuels and chemicals production. An overall benefit will be a template for the rational design of catalysts derived from the interdisciplinary activities of the project. In what has become a tradition in our laboratories, we regularly exchange information with industrial colleagues. In this project, we plan to involve industrial colleagues as technical advisors, both for science and possibly for technology transfer. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposal clearly impacts the education of graduate students and postgraduate fellows. Extensive training of young researchers at BNL is also planned in the project. A significant number of women students will be involved in the project, and the Tufts Summer Scholars program for undergraduates will be used to recruit other under represented groups. The dissemination of the work will follow the normal channels of publications, presentations and meetings. To achieve really broad dissemination, a website will be created as part of the nano catalysis and energy site to promote this work both as an educational resource and a recruiting tool NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Kapiolani Community College, University of Hawaii, recognizing that our continued success is contingent upon building a formal and institutionalized ?STEM enterprise? and developing more engaged STEM faculty who can offer compelling courses as well as mentor students in undergraduate research, the College proposes to create the organizational, administrative and programmatic excellence and infrastructure needed to support such an enterprise. Our long-term goals, therefore, are to: 1) institutionalize, improve and sustain a formal STEM enterprise; and 2) increase the number of STEM faculty engaged in producing more Native Hawaiian and other STEM degree completers. This I3 project will integrate faculty innovation within a formal, sustained, always improving STEM Program tied closely to the strategic and long range directions of the College NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will identify ways to reduce wildfire hazard and the loss of imperiled ecosystems by exploring the joint effects of climate and land use changes in western Oregon's Willamette Valley Ecoregion.  Three hypotheses will be tested: climate change will increase fuel loads and wildfire hazard; land development will increase the area of wildland-urban interface and alter vegetation in ways that increase the risk of wildfire and loss of imperiled ecosystems; and some management options will be more robust than others in mitigating fire risk and sustaining imperiled ecosystems across a range of future climate scenarios.  The work will employ a biophysical model that downscales from the coarse spatial scales of current climate change models to the fine spatial scales at which human land use and management decisions are made, and then scales back up to represent the landscape-scale effects of human actions on vegetation and fire hazard.  The biophysical model will be coupled with an agent-based model in which decision makers on individual land parcels respond to climate, land use regulation and incentives, land markets, perceived fire hazard, land management costs, and aesthetics.  This research will advance knowledge of how to bridge key theoretical and practical issues related to multiple types of system uncertainties, different spatial and temporal scales, and complex interactions and feedbacks among coupled natural and human systems.  The risk of catastrophic wildfire in the wildland-urban interface is a growing nationwide threat that projected climate change is likely to exacerbate.  This project supports emerging national, regional and local initiatives by providing tools to forecast risks and mitigate the impacts.  Global climate change models have become increasingly mechanistic, sophisticated and spatially explicit.  However, the development of interactive models of how biological and human cultural systems will respond to climate change at the spatial scales at which land use and management decisions are made is in its infancy.  This research will produce a transferable methodology for modeling such systems that is tractable, spatially explicit, and directly linked to policy-based decision-making.  The development of solutions that are robust to future uncertainties is an important approach toward adaptively managing complex systems that include strongly coupled ecological and socio-economic processes.  The project engages graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at two universities. It also involves students with stakeholder groups in workshops designed to support policy makers and the public in making more informed decisions that address the challenges of climate change NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Preliminary analysis of the storms preceding the recent Eastern Iowa floods have revealed that there was no single, extreme storm that was responsible for the flood conditions. Instead, the effect of a sequence of storms compounded, affecting locations along the larger rivers in the basin. We propose to investigate: (1) the link between the characteristics of the storms (or group of storms) that caused the floods along the Iowa River; (2) how storm properties are related to flooding as a function of basin scale, following insights from a new geophysical theory of floods; and (3) whether the methodologies developed here can be extended to other large basins using the Hydro?]NEXRAD radar?]rainfall dataset.The urgency of our proposal lies in the pressing need to understand the causes and far?]reaching effects of the 2008 Iowa flood. Undoubtedly, local authorities and communities will be looking to our research facility, IIHR?]Hydroscience and Engineering at The University of Iowa, to analyze the flooding events and offer guidance in adopting measures to prevent or mitigate the effect of future floods. While this proposal addresses a very recent, ongoing natural disaster, it is grounded in our collective, sustained work on the geophysical theory of floods.Intellectual Merit: Over the past 20 years, scientists at the University of Colorado, The University of Iowa, and other institutions have collaborated on a new theory of floods. Recent advances in this theory have revealed the important role played by the self?]similar structure of the river network in determining the magnitude of peak flows. In particular, flow aggregation patterns imposed by the presence of the river network provide explicit guidelines to understand the genesis of extreme flooding events similar to the ones in Eastern Iowa in June 2008. This framework allows rapid and physically meaningful analysis of flood events across a range of spatial scales, without the need to resort to rainfall?]runoff model calibration.Broader Impacts: This work could potentially change the concept of Probable Maximum Precipitation and Probable Maximum Flood and their use in engineering design. The analysis will also offer significant insight into our globally changing climate NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit:Because all aspects of biodiversity ultimately derive from DNA-level resources, a mechanistic theory of evolution must start at the genomic level. This work focuses on the hypothesis that many aspects of genome evolution are driven by nonadaptive forces (random genetic drift, mutation, and recombination) rather than natural selection responding to external ecological forces. Using mathematical/computational analysis, the research will exploit the enormous set of resources available from whole-genome sequencing projects, from viruses to organelles to bacteria and multicellular species. Because evolution is a population-level process, priority will be on developing a general theory for genomic evolution consistent with well-established principles of population genetics, while spanning the fields of computational biology and informatics, molecular and cellular biology, and systems biology.The overall goal is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics. Under the proposed hypothesis, many of the complex genomic features that are the hallmark of multicellular species emerged largely as a consequence of a substantial reduction in the efficiency of selection, whereas the streamlined genomes of microbial species result from highly efficient selection opposing the accumulation of mutationally hazardous excess DNA. At the very least, the theory to be developed provides a null (nonadaptive) hypothesis for interpreting the evolution of genome complexity. Broader Impact: Through the integration of these various subprojects, the overall goal of the proposed research is to help transform the descriptive field of comparative genomics into a more explanatory field of evolutionary genomics, as well as to help develop the intellectual infrastructure that will ultimately be necessary for the emergence of a field of evolutionary cell biology. In addition, the research project will be intertwined with a set of educational goals, including: 1) the establishment of an annual set of projects associated with a genome evolution class that services students from both the life sciences and informatics; 2) the recruitment of mathematically inclined biology undergraduates into a two- to three-year research program; and 3) the development of an integrative ?training-grant?-like environment among the grant participants NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project seeks to understand how science, public opinion, and media interact in shaping public decision making. The context of inquiry for this project will be the six communities currently being evaluated by the Department of Homeland Security to host the National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF). The design incorporates public opinion survey methodology, in-depth interviews with stakeholders and media content analysis. This multi-faceted design will provide insights into both successful and failed communication strategies aimed at engaging local residents, and help the research team develop a better understanding of how public deliberation can help or undermine efforts to meaningfully connect with various publics on risk-related issues. The research will contribute to understanding the social amplification an attenuation of risk. In particular, the PI is interested in two levels of outcome variables. At a first level, the PI will explore how the interplay of media coverage, interpersonal channels, and predispositional factors shape feelings of trust toward various stakeholders, including executive and regulatory bodies at the state and federal level, local agencies and governments, and other regional players. This first outcome variable is likely to directly shape a second-level outcome variable that this project examines through comparative analysis of multiple communities: public perceptions of risks and their dynamic nature over time NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The surge in the introduction of new products coupled with the significant reduction in time from product design to manufacturing, as well as the ever increasing customer's expectation for high reliability and longer warranties have prompted industry to shorten its product test duration.  In many cases, the testing of the products prototypes can take months and even years before actual production takes place.  In many situations, accelerated life testing which subjects the product samples to extreme conditions might be the only viable approach to assess whether the product meets the expected long term reliability requirements.  As a result, the accuracy of reliability estimates from such testing has a profound effect on the subsequent decisions regarding system configuration, warranties and preventive maintenance schedules.  Inappropriate implementation of the test might cause delays in product release, termination of the entire product or catastrophic failures in the actual use of the product.  In a variety of industrial applications, there could be many choices in stress loadings when conducting testing.  Each stress loading has some advantages and drawbacks.  This has raised many practical questions regarding the equivalence among various accelerating test plans involving different stress loadings.  The problem becomes more difficult when multiple stresses are involved.  To overcome these challenges, we propose to investigate and contribute fundamental and theoretical models and provide several statistical tools to facilitate practical reliability tests. New framework for planning accelerated testing under various stress loadings, especially under complex stress and multiple stresses conditions, will be established. If successful, the research results will fill a major gap in reliability assessment needed by industry.  Especially, the results will enable industry to design efficient and economical test plans, yet the results of the test will provide accurate reliability estimates.  The tools to be developed will facilitate and further promote the implementation of accelerated life testing in modern industry NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award will provide support for part of a major facility upgrade to benefit geochemical research at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Specifically, funds will be allocated over 3 years for acquisition of (1) a new generation noble gas mass spectrometer and inlet system, (2) a high sensitivity single collector (SC) ICP-MS, and (3) a high precision multi-collector (MC) ICP-MS.  The timing of this award is motivated by a combination of increasing demand at LDEO and AMNH for access to this type of instrumentation at a time when the performance of aging existing facilities is inadequate to pursue state of the art research, coupled with major new commitments by both institutions to geochemistry. These include ongoing construction of a $45M Geochemistry Building and new appointments of senior and junior Faculty to the Geochemistry Division at LDEO, a new phase of cooperation between LDEO and AMNH, and an unprecedented commitment to stabilize instrument maintenance and technique development through institutional contributions to technical support.  The new instrumentation is linked in that it fosters interdisciplinary research across a spectrum of themes.  The noble gas mass spectrometer will measure neon isotope ratios for surface exposure dating, further the development of constant flux proxies for paleoceanography, and advance studies of mantle dynamics. The SC-ICPMS will fulfill a growing need for analyses of ultra-low trace element abundances in water, ice and aerosols. At present, these efforts are compromised by other measurements of high concentration samples using shared instruments. The high sensitivity of a new MC-ICPMS will allow measurement of isotope ratios in smaller samples than is currently feasible and will be linked with a laser, bought separately with institutional funds. The laser ablation MC-ICPMS capability will serve a large number of LDEO and AMNH researchers and students who now travel extensively in order to obtain LA-ICPMS analyses. The new instrumentation will open new avenues to advance knowledge on fundamental topics such as solid earth geodynamics, ocean dynamics and climate, as well as the transport and fate of contaminants in aqueous systems and the atmosphere.The instrumentation is also critical for providing state-of-the-art technology for Earth science research and education in the New York City area. The enhanced infrastructure will promote cross-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations. The equipment is critical to continuance of both a strong graduate education program and a research training program at both the undergraduate and high school levels.  Since 2000 LDEO Geochemistry has produced 19 Columbia PhD dissertations and AMNH has hosted 15 graduate students from various universities. Currently, 27 Columbia PhD students are associated with the groups requesting instrumentation through this proposal. LDEO labs serve graduate students from regional institutions, including CUNY and Stony Brook. LDEO geochemists are actively involved in REU programs (> 40 interns since 2000). The AMNH REU program has hosted 22 interns since it started in 2003, in which most have been women and several have been African American or Hispanic. LDEO geochemists also provide research opportunities for high school students (> 25 since 2000). The new instrumentation will make a fundamental contribution to meeting research and educational needs of at least two CUNY campuses (Queens and Kingsborough CC) and at Fordham University, where LDEO and AMNH adjunct researchers have faculty positions.  Geochemists in this project are extensively involved in public education and outreach, such as public lectures, news media contributions, popular articles, and spearheading prominent exhibits (e.g., the Halls of Planet Earth, and of Meteorites, and of Gems and Minerals at AMNH). The AMNH exhibits and other public programs are important tools of public science education; some 4.5M people, including >0.6M K-12 students, visit AMNH each year. Geochemists involved in this proposal regularly give lectures in the Earth2Class Program (www.earth2class.org/) for K-12 science teachers. LDEO scientists use their expertise as members of governmental advisory boards, including NYC Mayor Bloomberg?s Council of Sustainable Development. The new instrumentation provides essential tools for continuation of our public outreach efforts NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Blackfeet Community College, Little Big Horn College, and Montana State University will collaborate in a project which will provide research experience, mentoring, and academic enrichment to students at the three schools. A total of 30 students over a five-year period will participate in the project beginning Summer 2009. Students from the three schools will engage in 2-year cohorts where they will they will do research in ecology, environmental science and microbiology projects relevant to their lives and career goals. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems, numerous mountain ranges and the Northern Great Plains will provide diverse ecosystems and opportunities for research. The collaborative network will enhance student opportunities on all three campuses and will also support graduates of LBHC and BCC as they transition to MSU for their bachelor?s degrees. The student participants will be mentored by science faculty and by Native American professional biologists in developing academic and research skills to prepare them to complete baccalaureate degrees and continue on in graduate school. The overall goal of the project is to increase the number of Native Americans completing bachelor?s degrees and entering graduate programs in ecology, in environmental science and in biological fields.

The website address is: http://www.montana.edu/wwwai NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The objective of this workshop is to develop a road map for planning a comprehensive bilateral US-Taiwan team- and center-based research and implementation plan for realizing significant advances in civil and mechanical infrastructure based on ?smart structures and systems through the adaptation of bio-inspired sensing and actuation technologies?. Taiwan is situated in a highly seismically active region of the world with devastating earthquakes occurring almost every decade and along the primary path of Northwestern Pacific tropical cyclones occurring almost yearly. Because of the extensive investment by the National Taiwan Council (NSC), Taiwan today is a recognized leader in the hazard mitigation field.  In this workshop we proposed that significant improvements in multiple nature hazard mitigation approaches are still possible and can be achieved through the adoption of transformative technologies such as bio-inspired sensing and actuation concepts. Bilateral groups of scientists from academia, government, and industry will be invited to contribute and to develop a framework for an integrated research frontier that is envisioned to revitalize US-Taiwan collaboration on emerging research serving pressing societal needs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Number:  EPS-0814103Proposal Title: RII: Enhancing Alabama?s Research Capacity in Nano/Bio Science and Sensors  Institution:   Alabama A&M UniversityGoals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement award will facilitate the creation of a statewide partnership among Alabama core research institutions to enhance R&D competitiveness in the emerging area of nano/bio science and molecular sensors. This partnership is designed to foster collaborative research, and to stimulate multidisciplinary education through four centers. Each center is designed to support and train new faculty, staff, and students in key nano- and biotechnology innovation areas aligned with the state?s economic development priorities outlined in the governor?s ?Plan 2010?.Project Major Foci: The Tuskegee University led center will develop and characterize new  biodegradable nanostructured materials; the Auburn University led center will use organismal models to identify mechanisms of adaptation to natural and man-made environmental challenges; the University of Alabama in Birmingham led center will develop new optical and molecular sensing technologies; and the Alabama A&M University led center will use nanopatterning and nanofabrication techniques to control structure-property relationships in order to tailor materials properties for specific applications. An additional role of this center will be the integration of the findings of each center to catalyze innovation based economic development. Intellectual MeritThe centers will ensure reciprocal transfer of information and technology between the life sciences and engineering to catalyze novel research in both fields. Biological discovery will elucidate structural and functional principles in living systems that can serve as templates for pioneering the design and synthesis of nanomaterials. Likewise, advances in nanoscale detection, quantification, and nanoengineering will open new frontiers in the life sciences. Broader ImpactsThe centers will establish statewide infrastructure that will foster collaboration, build partnerships, develop future STEM-enabled workforce, improve scientific literacy, and develop new economic opportunities. The centers research will likely have a major impact on the environment, homeland security, and industrial process control NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER We propose applying transcendence techniques to curves and abelian varieties in a family and to classical period maps to deduce transcendence properties for functions which are solutions of a Picard-Fuchs equation. This leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. These special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain Shimura subvarieties. This leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of Shimura varieties. We also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. We propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. A fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. A classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. This implies that e and pi are transcendental. In previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. We intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Arctic constitutes a unique and important environment, central to the dynamics and evolution of the Earth system. The region is currently experiencing rapid environmental change. The sources and ultimate consequences of such change are, however, still poorly understood. Research conducted as part of the NSF-ARCSS Arctic Freshwater Integration Study (FWI) program has documented not only the ongoing changes in the arctic hydrological cycle, but also the important role these changes play in global climate dynamics. Recently developed documents on research needs have emphasized the critical function of arctic freshwater processes in ecosystem, social and global systems. The recently released SEARCH Implementation Plan (SEARCH, 2005) describes changes in the freshwater system as one of the most consequential links between the arctic and the earth systems. Two of eleven working groups in the November 2005 International Conference on Arctic Research Planning II (ICARP II) focused almost exclusively on freshwater dynamics as the highest priority for the next decade of arctic research. The work in this proposal will support the goals of SEARCH and contribute to IPY through enhancing our understanding of the changing arctic system on circumpolar scales. The primary function of the efforts described in this proposal is to maintain the Arctic- CHAMP Science Management Office (SMO), expand the SMO portfolio of support activities to include those recently identified by the FWI rank-and-file to realize the FWI Synthesis, and to assist ARCSS in coordinating emerging Arctic-CHAMP science and outreach efforts.Intellectual Merit: The Arctic-CHAMP synthesis and integration issues are complex and multi-faceted and a dedicated, well-managed, Science Management Office is necessary to provide an efficient mechanism for facilitating maximum collaboration and coordination among project participants and other related research activities. The research and integration activities of the FWI participants is now well established and progressing towards ultimately achieving a valuable synthesis of broad-scale understanding of atmospheric/terrestrial/oceanic connections through the freshwater cycle of the pan- Arctic; however, and as we have found, coordination of synthesis activities is essential to achieve maximum productivity and full-system scale integration. The SMO will specifically:Support the ongoing activities of the Arctic-CHAMP Scientific Steering CommitteeCatalyze synthesis across FWI projects and make FWI synthesis relevant to ARCSS community wide synthesisOrganize Arctic-CHAMP and FWI scientific meetings and symposiaSupport the timely delivery of CHAMP-related science data products and develop a coordinatedpre-ADCC archive of FWI synthesis data productsOrganize and conduct two major FWI synthesis Workshops in 2007 (for FWI investigators) and 2008 (as an IPY-affiliated meeting), including the exercise of the FWI synthesis compendiumConduct liaison activities with other US and international agency partners, with a special focus on IPY and ICARP-II.Disseminate findings of Arctic-CHAMP effort, to scientists and broader user communities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Blackfeet Community College, Little Big Horn College, and Montana State University will collaborate in a project which will provide research experience, mentoring, and academic enrichment to students at the three schools.

The website address is: http://www.montana.edu/wwwai NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal creates a Diffusion and Evaluation Center for the Research in Education and Evaluation in Science and Engineering (REESE) program.  Specifically, this Center: 1. Provides support and capacity building opportunities for the REESE PIs through technical assistance that strengthens methodological and analytic approaches;2. Creates opportunities for dialogue and interaction through PI and other themed meetings, online resources, and provides mechanisms for PIs to share instrumentation, data and findings;3. Produces studies and reports based on various aspects of the REESE portfolio through (in consultation with NSF) identifying criteria to assess the rigor of studies and provide information on the effectiveness of the program and the studies it supports; 4. Summarizes key findings of REESE projects to various audiences such as researchers, policymakers, and practitioners; 5. Contributes to the creation of an evaluation framework for the REESE program, and6. Conducts original research on salient issues related to the portfolio NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This Workshop will be held in Hilton Head, South Carolina - March 2009.  Workshop:  A Workshop on Friction:  A Grand Challenge at the interface of Solid and Fluid Mechanics.  A grand challenge lies in the formulation of unified analysis techniques addressing friction through the momentum/energy transfer and thermal processes leading to the diversion of useful kinetic energy to parasitic processes on atomic to continuum scales, irrespective of the media on either side of the interface.Improved understanding and modeling of the multiple origins of friction form a vital component of technologies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of human development and transportation, ranging from reduced wear, noise and/or vibration, increased transmission efficiency, turbulent skin friction reduction for increased vehicle efficiency, improved models and control of pollutant dispersion by atmospheric winds in urban ?rough? environments to advanced understanding of environmental physics and climate phenomena such as ice-field development and glacier melting NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Blackfeet Community College, Little Big Horn College, and Montana State University will collaborate in a project which will provide research experience, mentoring, and academic enrichment to students at the three schools.

The website address is: http://www.montana.edu/wwwai NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a request to support a US / Japan Future Network Workshop. The Workshop will bring together leading US and Japanese network researchers and network research infrastructure developers.The workshop will bring together a diverse group of researchers from the US and Japan to discuss the science and technology advances needed to advance our fundamental understanding of the design, deployment and operation of the increasingly complex, networks of the future. The outcome of this workshop will lead to a better understanding of network research andnetwork research infrastructure activities in the two countries.The proposed workshop will result in more efficient ways of how peer researchers in networking research and infrastructure, from both countries, will collaborate and communicate with each other. The workshop has potential for the development of individual linkages between peerresearchers in each country NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Professional Development Program (PDP) is designed to prepare science and engineering graduate students for designing and teaching inquiry-based laboratory modules. Led by Dr. Lisa Hunter (University of Hawaii), the PDP includes workshops followed by a practical teaching experience, usually at the college level. In addition to training for teaching, a major outcome of the program is the innovative, inquiry-based laboratory units developed and taught by PDP participants. Laboratory units developed through the PDP have been very successful in Hawaii college courses and programs, and are an essential element of the recently launched Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI), which includes curriculum development for a new electro-optics program at Maui Community College. This award will support, in part, the workshops held within the PDP and will ensure the inclusion of  Hawaii-based graduate student participants in the program, maintaining the momentum and educational partnerships established by the NSF Center for Adaptive Optics, and now being transferred to AWI, managed by the University of Hawaii, Institute for Astronomy. The PDP is specifically designed to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to teach in a way that engages students from all backgrounds in the processes and practices of science. The integration of research and education is an essential part of the PDP. Included within PDP are sessions on addressing diversity and equity in the classroom.  All PDP participants are required to consider how they will engage all students in their teaching. In addition to the overall focus on diversity and methods for broadening participation, this work will have a significant impact on the Maui community. PDP participants will teach in courses and programs that include significant numbers of Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and other underrepresented groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER MATERIAL FLAMMABILITY IN EXPLORATION ATMOSPHERES   A program to develop a material flammability testing methodology that will complement the existing NASA protocol so as to provide a more comprehensive assessment of material flammability in the conditions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SPECTROSCOPY OF NATURAL GLASSES AND CONSTRAINTS ON MINERALS DETECTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE INFRARED   ABSTRACT: The objectives of the proposed work are to establish parameters for the analysis and interpretation of thermal infrared (IR) spectra of natural NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER GALEX Observations of Comet 8P/Tuttle   Comets are primordial objects left over from the formation of the Solar System. Their study is therefore directly relevant to NASA strategic Sub-goal 3C:  Advance scientific knowledge of the origin and history of NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award provides funding for management and support of national networking activities for the Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence (COSEE).  There are eleven separate Centers within the U.S. that are coordinated via the Central Coordinating Office (CCO). The CCO will be organized by three PI?s; Gail Scowcroft, Associate Director, Office of Marine Programs, University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography will act as the National Network Coordinator (NNC);  Annette deCharon, University of Maine, will organize the development of a national website and support more centralized web development at all Centers; and Dr. Billy Spitzer, New England Aquarium, will help with long-term strategy development and organization of the National Advisory Committee (NAC). This project builds on their prior work as the National Interim Leadership Team, a group that was formed to serve the COSEE Network during a one-year funding hiatus for the existing CCO.  The proposed CCO team will work closely with the National COSEE Council, the NAC, and the NSF Program Officers to address a national gap in the coordination of ocean science education, facilitate communication between the Centers, and improve overall network functioning. The CCO will move the Network forward on a number of key initiatives that strengthen it, reduce duplication, and enhance the overall impact of COSEE. One important role of the CCO is the facilitation of the transfer of best practices between Centers. Site visits will allow the CCO team to investigate activities and products from Centers that might further other Centers? goals. By facilitating such transfers, the CCO provides a unique and useful addition to the current network. Perhaps one of the most significant tasks of the CCO in achieving intellectual merit is to increase the number of ocean scientists who participate in ocean science education and outreach. The CCO plans to annually expand the number of ocean scientist/educator partnerships formed through COSEE activities. Documentation is key to sharing ?lessons learned?; thus CCO deliverables include ?user friendly,? accessible national evaluation database and a national website. The Broader Impacts of this proposal include developing materials and providing support for ocean science educational outreach to the public and to K-12 teachers and students. The CCO will also strive to broaden the participation of under-represented and under-served (U/U) students in the various activities supported by the COSEE network by developing partnerships with U/U groups and professional societies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Copper amine oxidase (CAO) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) belong to a family of proteins that contain quinone cofactors that are formed post-translationally from tyrosine, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-phenylalanine quinone (TPQ), and lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ), respectively. These enzymes catalyze the modification of biogenic amines and play roles in cell signaling and collagen formation. The structure/function study of these quinone cofactors is essential to characterize the differences in their chemical properties. Although the chemical function of TPQ in CAO catalysis has been well studied, very little is known about LTQ. Further, the role of copper in catalysis in both enzymes remains unclear. The research project will further define the chemical properties of TPQ and LTQ and the role of copper in CAO catalysis, as well as develop a model system to understand the chemical function of LTQ in LOX. The research utilizes the tools and techniques of biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinorganic and synthetic organic chemistry. The results of this research will not only broaden understanding of quinoproteins but also impact fundamental understanding of other cross-linked quinones that are widely found in nature. This will aid in understanding the evolutionary advantage of selecting one quinone cofactor over the other in biological systems.Broader Impact: This multidisciplinary project provides an excellent opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to study at the interface of chemistry and biology and participate in an international collaboration. An outreach program will be initiated to invite female students from local high schools to spend two weeks in the Chemistry department at the University of Kansas. The students will work in the laboratory and meet with female faculty and graduate students to discuss both science and the issues facing women in chemistry. These experiences are intended to encourage more women to follow careers in chemistry by demonstrating at the outset that the academic environment can be supportive to women. The workshop will also show that chemistry is a diverse subject that is much broader in scope than what would typically be taught in high school. In concert, a chemical biology course targeting upper level undergraduate and graduate students will be developed to demonstrate how chemical methods are used to understand fundamental aspects of biological systems. The course will include protein chemistry, especially post-translational modifications as well as a survey of cutting edge discoveries, intended to show students that chemists can make important contributions at the cutting-edge of biological science. Students participating in the Initiative for Minority Student Development (IMSD)-Bioscience Initiative program at the University of Kansas will be encouraged to enroll in this course. The principal investigator will actively recruit minority undergraduate students through this program into her laboratory to help them in pursuing graduate studies and a research career in the field of chemical biology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a proposal to conduct the national evaluation of the COSEE Network. In this proposal we lay out an approach for designing and conducting the evaluation. This approach centers around collaborative design, creating a community of evaluators within the COSEE network, and taking a broad perspective on the ways in which the investment in COSEE is making contributions to the field.  The major evaluation tasks we propose include an annual survey of Centers, the creation of an evaluator community, and direct data gathering from Centers in the form of interviews and site visits. We see COSEE as an investment in a national infrastructure for Ocean Sciences education: a network of Centers and associated partners that can not only provide educational services but also build the capacity of the field for doing higher quality and more extended Ocean Sciences education. We believe that the evaluation of COSEE should focus on both the direct educational contributions that COSEE is making, but also on the more intangible contributions in terms of generating leadership, collaborations, knowledge and advocacy for the field. We also argue that the evaluation should help COSEE better understand itself, improving its design, informing its management, and refining its implementation. The COSEE Network represents a sophisticated arrangement that creates a national network linking together distinct Ocean Sciences Education Centers. The evaluation plan proposed here draws upon and adds to a knowledge base of the design principles underlying networks, centers, and science education improvement. The evaluation will not only document the contributions of the network to public and professional audiences, but also study the network as an example of an improvement infrastructure for Ocean Sciences education. This conceptualization will help to create an evaluative framework that will allow for a richer understanding of the multiple dimensions of NSF's investments in large complex network projects. The evaluation will thus contribute to the knowledge base that informs the design and evaluation of large-scale, field-building initiatives. This proposed evaluation plan will promote the improvement of education, particularly science education, in multiple ways. First, it will help COSEE understand the investment made in the Network by studying the ways in which and the extent to which the network is serving its intended audiences and providing well-designed opportunities for a variety of audiences to learn Ocean Science. Second, the evaluation will help the COSEE Network better manage the use of its resources, by understanding the needs and opportunities for refining the way in which the Network operates. Third, the evaluation will contribute to a better understanding of ways in which the Network builds both individual and collective capacity for doing high-quality Ocean Sciences education. And finally the evaluation will contribute to a better understanding of how this design -- a network of independent centers -- can be used in other arenas to further develop a national improvement infrastructure for science education NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The objective of this proposed workshop is to lay the groundwork for implementing the recommendations that were developed through The ?5XME? Workshop, held on May 10-11, 2007 in  Arlington, Virginia. The proposed workshop will develop curricular templates, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, based on the recommendations from the previous report, for various types of schools (e.g., large public, large private, small public, small private). It is anticipated  that these templates will facilitate the adoption of the 5XME recommendations by a wide cross section of mechanical engineering departments across the country.A diverse group of mechanical engineering educators will be brought together in the workshop to ensure that all points of view and learning styles are fully considered. These workshop participants will represent leaders (e.g., department heads, program advisors) from a variety of schools (i.e., small, large, public, private) to reduce the barriers to implementation of curricular reforms in mechanical engineering departments across the country NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The goal of the Firefly cubesat is to unambiguously determine if Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (TGFs) are produced by lightning, and to determine the characteristics of lightning that produce the fluxes of gamma rays observed at high altitude.  This information will strongly constrain the processes that accelerate electrons to ~35 million electron volts (MeV) above thunderstorms, since these electrons are thought to be the source of TGFs.  Firefly will detect a minimum of 50 TGFs, with a goal of more than 200, to definitively determine the types of lightning that produce gamma rays.  TGFs are of inherent interest, as they result from the most powerful natural particle acceleration process on Earth, in which thermal electrons are energized to tens of MeV in less than 1 millisecond.  These energized electrons create copious bremsstrahlung gamma and X-rays that can be observed from orbiting platforms, and the electrons themselves may escape to magnetospheric altitudes and populate the inner electron radiation belt.  By studying the TGF phenomena and the acceleration processes responsible for them on Earth, the investigators will improve understanding of other regimes of electron acceleration, including the radiation belts, solar flares, cosmic shocks, and other planets, including Venus, the outer planets, and dust devils and dust storms on Mars.  Firefly CubeSat satellite will be designed, built, tested, and operated on-orbit as part of this project. Firefly consists of two instruments: a gamma-ray detector (GRD) and a very low frequency receiver/ photometer experiment (VP).  GRD will measure photons between 10 keV - 10 MeV, and up-going energetic electrons over an energy range of 10 keV to a few MeV.  The Firefly team is a collaboration between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Siena College, with the Hawk Institute for Space Sciences serving as the spacecraft bus provider, and the systems engineering, education, and public outreach lead.  Students will be involved in all aspects of the project, from design and development, through fabrication and test, to mission operations and data analysis.  Firefly will help to train undergraduate students at Siena College and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), as they get hands-on experience designing, building, testing, and operating the spacecraft, as well as analyzing the data.  Local high school students and interns will also have access to the Firefly data, educational materials, and website.  Finally, the Firefly project includes the installation of two World Wide Lightning Location Network ground stations at Siena and UMES, giving the students access to a tool that can be used for many data analysis projects, and that will be a permanent addition to the educational infrastructure at these institutions.  Firefly will support the development of a website, with continuous updates on the development of the instrument and spacecraft, and on-orbit mission status, open access to the data and science results, a  data users' manual , and a Firefly manual, including lessons NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scheduling policies are explicitly (or implicitly) used everywhere that resources need to be allocated, and resultantly the theory of scheduling has a long and varied history.  Out of this large body of work, two distinct research communities have emerged and, unfortunately, researchers in each community are often not aware of results from the other community.  One set of researchers from the theoretical computer science and optimization communities has focused on providing competitive guarantees for scheduling disciplines in the worst-case environment.  A different set of researchers, from the performance modeling and applied probability communities, has focused on providing exact performance analyses of scheduling policies in stochastic/probabilistic environments.  Each of these approaches have specific advantages and disadvantages when carried out on their own.  The aim of this project is to develop techniques that can achieve the  best of both worlds , i.e., to combine ideas from each community to arrive at results neither has been able to achieve alone.  Specifically, the goal of this project is to develop approaches that combine worst-case results and techniques with qualitative and quantitative techniques for analyzing stochastic models, thus combining the breadth of models where worst-case results can be applied with the real-world applicability of stochastic analysis. This is an ambitious goal, but one that will open up a new avenue of research in an important, well established field.  If successful, it can bring together ideas from two distinct communities which attack similar problems with very different techniques, and thus is likely to identify new scheduling disciplines that will impact system design in practice.  Additionally, the project will have a broad impact on the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through the development of a new unified approach to teaching scheduling theory NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a proposal to process the GRACE satellite range, range-rate, and range-acceleration data with a goal to obtain a map of the geoid over the Antarctic with spatial resolution between 35 and 100 km. The free-air gravity derived from this geoid should fundamentally change our view on geological structure and history of the Antarctic continent in much the same way that the GEOSAT mission impacted our understanding of plate tectonics in the world's oceans. Due to resource limitations, however, the GRACE project team will not use the range and its derivatives to generate high spatial resolution estimates of the gravity field along the satellite ground track. The new geoid and derived free-air gravity field will require development of an algorithm to process the range, range-rate and range acceleration data and convert them to a self-consistent geoid. The GRACE-derived gravity field will be compared with marine, airborne gravity and land-based surveys as well as with major geological features of the Antarctic continent to assess wavelength resolution. This comparison will require the integration of the airborne and marine data sets and determination of the subglacial topography for some of the airborne surveys. Once the new geoid and derived fee-air gravity have been generated, the continent-wide subglacial topography could be estimated via an optimal co-kriging interpolation of the available bedrock measurements and the geoid, joint with the statistical relationships describing the spatial variation of topography, and the spatial correlation of the geoid and topography. The subglacial topography will be also determined using an alternative approach, the Parker inversion method. These products will be made available to the ice sheet modeling community. The new continent-wide subglacial topography will be used in combination with altimetric ice surface elevations to calculate a new estimate of Antarctic ice sheet volume, which can be used to calibrate the eustatic sea-level curve from oxygen isotope data for the present and maximum possible variations of the global sea level curve. The new subglacial topography estimates will also be used to interpret geologic structures of the Antarctic and the processes responsible for their formation. This research will have several areas of broader impact and intellectual merit: (a) the map of subglacial topography, together with an improved estimate of the Antarctic ice volume, will be an important contribution to the science goals of the Antarctic Climate Evolution initiative (ACE). Modeling the nucleation of the East Antarctic ice sheet relies on high-quality subglacial topography models, as well as modeling the drainage of the entire ice sheet. (b) The proposed GRACE-derived gravity approach, if proven to be successful, can be applied to the Arctic region and indeed to the entire world. While the Arctic gravity field is of high quality south of 82 N (ERS-1 orbit coverage), a large polar gap remains. Mapping the main geological features in these hard-to-reach parts of the world from satellite measurements would be a significant step forward in understanding the plate tectonic features of the Artic and Antarctic and should extend significantly recent marine geological and tectonic studies of the region NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A Doppler High Frequency (HF) radar is placed at the Jicamarca Peru Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility for the purpose of untangling the processes that lead to the onset of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), and in turn to scintillations of radio signals traversing the ionosphere, including GPS signals.  The spectra and propagation of ionospheric perturbations just below the F-region peak are characterized, and their relationship to EPBs observed at Jicamarca is determined.  The variability of vertical ion drift in the enhanced ion density preceding the neutral wind reversal is determined during solar minimum conditions, and the relationship of that variability to equatorial plasma bubble onset is determined.  The extent to which neutral winds modulate the occurrence of EPBs, and possibly override otherwise effective triggering mechanisms is also evaluated using data from nearby Fabry-Perot interferometers.  The determined relationships between plasma perturbations below the F-region ionospheric peak, variability of the vertical ion drift, the neutral wind, and EPB onset are finally used to in an attempt to predict EPB generation, along with associated radio scintillations NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This research develops measures of firms? resources devoted to the development of new products and business models in the financial services industry, an activity called ?finance R&D.?  The work helps fill a vast gap in our knowledge of the investment and innovation process for a large and important sector of economic activity in the United States. Traditional R&D spending captures the cost of the ?work done? by scientists and engineers because the innovation process in manufacturing is well understood to originate in a laboratory.  But where do financial innovations, such as credit default swaps, derivatives, electronic payment systems, ATMs, and the like originate?  A recent review of the empirical literature on financial innovation (Frame and White 2004) suggests little is known about the process.The novel aspect of our research will be to further develop available measures of intangible investment and capital by exploiting Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employer-based datasets on employment and wages by detailed occupation and industry. The BLS data will be used in combination with information obtained from semi structured interviews with industry executives to build estimates of the ?work done? by the employees (or contractors) who conduct the design and development activity in (or for) financial services firms.  The interviews will leverage the Conference Board?s extensive network of business contacts to obtain the required information as well as to generally expand our knowledge of the innovation process in financial services industries. The resulting industry-level series for finance R&D will both supplement traditional R&D measures and enhance the Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2006) macroeconomic estimates of the contribution of intangible capital to U.S. economic growth.Broader impacts:  The need for better metrics of innovation and the knowledge economy was underscored by the Advisory Committee on Innovation established by the Secretary of Commerce. One of its main findings was to better measure business intangible investments, and another was to develop a fuller accounting of the sources of economic growth. Our research aims to advance these two goals by working on a large and from the standpoint of the empirical productivity literature largely under researched sector of the U.S. economy NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The NSDL Technical Network Services (TNS) project is providing a robust and extensible cyberinfrastructure foundation for the central services of the NSDL that enable a wide range of NSF grantees and outside partners to share technical capacity and deliver valuable educational tools and resources to their own communities. The project has four primary areas of effort:1) Engaging the NSDL and STEM education communities to nurture a common vision for NSDL and its technical infrastructure and to foster broad-based community contributions;2) Enabling NSDL to function as a shared, collaborative, contributory space supporting the creation and display of context around networked educational resources to enhance discovery, use, and understanding; 3) Supporting and extending the NSDL core infrastructure for implementing and developing new educational applications and networked tools for audiences across the full range of STEM research, learning, and education; and4) Ensuring that the NSDL network and its accompanying tools and services are a robust, reliable, and highly available resource for all users.The intellectual merit of this effort lies in the unique and potentially transformative opportunity it has to integrate a wide range of tools, services, content, and context from many different institutions and projects into a common framework of knowledge organization and discovery, enabling other projects to accomplish far more than they could have on their own. By integrating resources, description, context and contribution from many varied organizations, projects, and individuals, and by offering tools to explore and understand this knowledge space, the TNS project is serving as an important component of support for cyber-enabled STEM education in a networked world. The broader impacts of this project are felt along several directions. First, it is helping both NSF grantees and many other related educational projects to better serve their specific audiences by focusing less on recreating technical developments and focusing more on serving as sites for teaching, mentoring, and supporting research of large numbers of STEM students and teachers. Second, it is establishing a broad-based community engagement process to foster creativity, innovation, and contributions to the design and use of next-generation educational cyberinfrastructure and interactive learning applications. Third, it is instrumenting the NSDL infrastructure to collect detailed (anonymized) usage and behavioral data, providing the basis for next-generation research into: personalized learning, educationally-informed recommendation engines, formation and evolution of educational social networks, and other areas where large volumes of user-generated actions and activities are needed NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The NSDL Center for Sustaining Broader Impacts combines intra-community support structures for NSDL grantees with well-defined mechanisms for effective outreach and dissemination in a Web 2.0 world to organizations and coalitions that provide K-12 teachers and/or higher education faculty with educational materials or professional development. Four primary goals guide the work of the center:1) Mobilization: to facilitate the flow of information and communications across NSDL projects to build community capacity, set priorities, and identify emerging issues so that the community can exploit its opportunities and address its challenges collectively.2) Synthesis: to mine the collective knowledge and experience of the community and synthesize the work of NSDL projects to inform community best practices.3) Dissemination: to place resources and research into the hands of educators through targeted outreach activities, by bundling specific products and services to meet users' needs, and by distributing NSDL products and services through trusted dissemination channels.4) Analysis and Evaluation: to create and foster a culture of data gathering and interpretation to support the analysis of needs and trends so that NSDL can create more effective products and services that meet the demands of STEM learners. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its core strategies of: i) brokering partnerships and opportunities on behalf of the community; ii) monitoring trends and practices; iii) promoting and advocating for NSDL; iv) customizing and contextualizing NSDL resources; v) putting NSDL in the path of users; and vi) systematic data gathering to inform short-term decision-making and long-term sustainability planning. Taken together these can serve as a model for Web 2.0 educational organizations. The project is exerting broader impacts through its dedication to the integration of research with education, the provision of services and support for teacher training, professional development, and STEM workforce growth.  By advocating for STEM education through partnership and capacity-building activities, across multiple disciplines and audiences, the center is extending NSDL's reach and effectiveness and creating new channels for reaching audiences and for understanding impact. This effort is essential to the realization of the NSDL community vision of transforming many distinct and important initiatives into an increasingly coherent whole, all in the service of STEM education NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Workshop on RecursionIt is well-known that language is an window into the human mind, notjust because our words reveal our thoughts, but because the way we putwords together reflects principles of organization that allowcreativity to flourish. Recent mathematically based research inlinguistic theory has identified computational principles that promiseto provide the software behind our neurological hardware.  Thisworkshop will bring together linguists, biologists, psychologists,philosophers and computer scientists who are discovering how theselinguistic principles provide the abstract basis for language learningand learning in general.  Central to this enterprise is a simpleconcept, recursion, the idea of building complex structures throughrepeated application of simple rules, which may provide a metaphor forthe organization of all human action.This workshop is timely because research on complex structures inlanguage and cognition is now reaching a point where the various typesof complexity can begin to be defined with sufficient precision toconsolidate results and discover the sources and limits of complexhuman cognition.  By identifying the ways in with complex structuresand complex can arise from the application of simple rules, thisresearch lays the foundation for new ways of designing curriculum foroptimal learning, new perspectives on artificial intelligence and newinsight into the evolutionary changes that distinguish animalcognition from human cognitive abilities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award will fund an analysis of the interactions between groundwater, soil and vegetation properties, and desert dust generation. Wind erosion of desert soils is thought to cause irreversible change to ecosystems, and the mobilized particulate matter can seriously degrade air quality. In deserts globally, regions that produce the most dust are characterized by low elevation depressions where wind erodible material has been and continues to be deposited fluvially. Shallow groundwater is often pumped from these regions for agricultural and municipal use. Since water demands are rapidly increasingly in many desert regions, there is increasing need to understand of how groundwater management might influence dust generation. Ideally, information could be attained that would guide groundwater management with the goal of promoting soil stability. This project will utilize measurements of vegetation and soil conditions and wind velocities to model wind erosion at a range of sites that experienced successively greater groundwater fluctuation over the past 20 years. Model results will be compared to direct measurements of recent soil loss using radiogenic fallout isotopes and dust traps. Finally, measurements of soil resource availability (nutrients and soil moisture) will be used to understand feedback processes between groundwater decline, soil loss, and ecosystem changes that might promote continued soil instability. Broader Impacts: The project will have a broad impact on our understanding of the role water management has on dust and air quality in deserts. The work will form collaborations between academic institutions and regulatory groups in the proposed study region, near Bishop, California. Both the Inyo County Water Department and the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District will provide necessary data to the project and gain important information on how their vegetation and air quality management activities could be tailored to gain long-term sustainability NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The advent of computer and digital information technologies and there development have greatly changed the world we live in. Today digital technologies are everywhere in our lives. A key step that makes all those technologies possible is to convert analog data into digital ones, a process known analog-to-digital conversion, or A/D conversion. With demand for higher precision and more cutting-edge technologies, the mathematics of A/D conversion algorithms plays a key role in this quest. The research proposed in this proposal focuses mainly on the mathematics and algorithms of A/D conversion. Given that analog devices are to different degrees imprecise by nature, robustness is extremely important if high precision is desired. The proposal will focus on robust A/D conversion algorithms. In this proposal the PI will address two of the main sources of imprecisions: imprecise quantizations and imprecise multiplications. The proposed encoders are the first encoders to be completely robust against quantizer and multiplier imprecisions. The PI proposes to study both the algorithms and the mathematical questions that arise from the study. The PI also studies ways the encoders can be extended and refined, along with many related and often challenging mathematical problems. The core of this project is a novel class of analog-to-digital conversion algorithms. These algorithms have the advantage that they are robust against quantization errors (imprecisions) and multiplication imprecisions. The novelty of these A/D algorithms comes from the use of Golden Ratio based expansions of real numbers related to the Fibonacci numbers. More general algorithms involve a class of algebraic integers and matrix encoders. The PI and his collaborators have already built a circuit of an A/D converter based on one of our algorithms, which has yielded outstanding result. A main objective of this proposal is to study these algorithms in greater depth, particularly concerning the stability and robustness of these algorithms. Equally important is that the study of these A/D algorithms has raised a number of interesting and challenging mathematical questions. Graduate students will be involved in the project. In addition, the proposed research lends naturally to collaborations between mathematicians and the engineering community NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CORONAL DIMMING REGIONS AS PROXIES FOR CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS AND GEOMAGNETIC STORMS- Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most powerful geoeffective solar phenomena observed. Unfortunately research has shown not all Earth-directed CMEs capable of observ NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER EXPANDING THE COSMIC CALENDAR PROJECT FOR 1YA TO WIDER AUDIENCES: The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) - is currently engaged in a project with the Origins Forum (part of the NASA Science Mission Directorate education and public outreach effort NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Why do leading advocacy organizations in transnational networks construe certain global problems, but not others, as international issues? How do certain issues rise to global prominence while other social problems fall by the wayside? The study will answer this question by collecting data on the rise and fall of issues in the transnational human rights network. First, it will capture variation in the human rights issue agenda through surveys and interviews with human rights activists, and analysis of advocacy websites. Second, it will explore reasons for this variation through a series of focus groups with activists from leading organizations in the human rights network. Participants will be asked about what is and is not on the human rights agenda; how this changes over time, and why. These data will yield insights as to how ideas move through and (sometimes) gain footholds in transnational communities of practice.Significant numbers of Masters and Ph.D. students from the University of Pittsburgh and Carleton University will be trained to conduct interviews and focus groups, as well as in the systematic use of qualitative data analysis software and scientific methods for reaching vailid inferences about large, unstructured text datasets.  This project will integrate rigorous, computer-assisted qualitatitive methods into the study of transnational networkds NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports an initiative by Professor Madeleine M. Joullie of the University of Pennsylvania to provide vital information to the chemical community on NSF-supported programs focussing on chemical research and education.  The Town Hall Meetings will be conducted during the next four National American Chemical Society Meetings and thus will allow conference participants from diverse geographic areas (New Orleans (Spring 2008), Philadelphia (Fall 2008), Salt Lake City (Spring 2009), and Washington, DC (Fall 2009)) to participate.  At the request of the organizer, NSF staff will be made available to answer questions on specific NSF-wide and Divisional solicitations as well as individual questions from current and potential investigators NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL- 0814031 and 0813874PI:  Sandra Martell (U. Wisconsin) and Leslie Herrenkohl (U. Washington) Collaborative Research: Building capacity and collaboration at the intersection of the Learning Sciences and Informal Science EducationABSTRACTThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Washington propose a conference, conference proceedings, and book that will build capacity and new collaborations at the intersection of the learning sciences and informal science education.  These activities continue to expand on the outcomes of several recent conferences, publications, and projects related to research on the learning sciences and their application to varieties of educational settings.  Fifty participants in this initiative will include both emerging and established researchers and practitioners, as well as international professionals NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CONTACT SPACECRAFT SURFACE BIOLOAD ASSAY SENSOR / The objective of this proposed effort is to demonstrate a non-contact / non-invasive / non-destructive sensor and method to detect / enumerate / and classify both bacterial spores and cells and other biolo NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project develops novel computational approaches and analytical tools to meet the challenges and opportunities for social network analysis brought by the availability of large-scale longitudinal data generated by the usage patterns of modern communication devices, such as cell-phones. This type of data has several key advantages including the fact that it is statistically extensive (coming from millions of users), purely observational (void of any bias induced by obtrusive measurements), and longitudinal (spanning several years). The extent and longitudinal character of such data brings challenges that can only be tackled by an orchestrated multidisciplinary approach invoking social science, physics methods developed for large-scale interacting particle systems, mathematical statistics and data analysis, and computer science methods for data mining, and agent-based modeling. The project will focus in particular on generating 1) Novel computational and analytic methods for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of large-scale social network data, based on advanced nonlinear time-series methods, community detection algorithms, and probabilistic relational models; 2) Stochastic mathematical models for network behavior coupled across several levels of analysis, including node, dyad, triad and group levels, and 3) A data-driven stochastic individual-based simulation (SIBS) framework with predictive capability for macro-level system behavior, implementing the dynamic models from 2). The SIBS design will allow it to be used as a hypothesis generation multilevel framework for social dynamics, and as an application, it will be employed to uncover the modalities for efficient, targeted spread of information in large-scale dynamic social networks. The suite of methods developed, and the SIBS with its design transparency and parallelism provide data-driven, feature extraction tools for addressing social science questions, as well as aiding mechanism-design and decision-making in practical situations. In particular, they are expected to directly impact applications both within the commercial (product delivery, health-care services, etc.) and non-commercial (urban planning, emergency alert systems, etc.) domains NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that garnet-bearing amphibolites and pelitic schists from the northwest U.S. Cordillera preserve a record of late Mesoproterozoic high pressure metamorphism that can be attributed to significant crustal thickening along the western margin of Laurentia before or during the assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. To this end a research team from Washington State University, West Virginia University, and University of Idaho are undertaking an integrated geochronologic and metamorphic analysis of garnet-bearing metamorphic assemblages in the northwest U.S. Cordillera in order to: 1) determine the ages of metamorphism using Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd geochronology of garnets and U-Th-Pb geochronology of monazites in order to determine the extent of Proterozoic metamorphism throughout the northwest U.S. Cordillera; 2) establish the pressure-temperature conditions of mineral growth in these metamorphic assemblages; 3) compare the results from the garnet and monazite chronometers and integrate this information with the metamorphic fabrics using detailed petrography; and 4) link both the geochronologic and pressure-temperature information to the penetrative deformational fabrics preserved in the rocks. Establishment of a linkage between late Mesoproterozoic metamorphism and the high temperature, high-pressure assemblages that exist in these rocks over a considerable area will show that a major period of crustal thickening during convergent tectonism occurred on the western margin of Laurentia at the end of the Mesoproterozoic. The presence of an approximately one billion year old contractional belt in the northwestern U.S., if confirmed, would imply that the history of metamorphism and deformation in the Cordillera is more complicated than previously appreciated. These results would provide important piercing points for late Mesoproterozoic tectonic reconstructions. In particular, results of this project will provide additional constraints on correlations of western Laurentia with other cratonal fragments such as Australia, Siberia, Antarctica, and China and will ultimately impact various reconstructions of Rodinia.The Grenville orogeny was an important event that substantially modified the North American continent approximately one billion years ago. The metamorphic rocks produced in this event can be found in wide belt that extends from eastern Canada to southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Preliminary geochronological data yielded the unexpected result that metamorphism of this age also occurred in the northwestern U.S. To confirm these data, this project is using new geochronological methods to determine the ages of minerals that are commonly produced during the metamorphism that occurs during mountain belt formation. If the preliminary results are born out, current understanding of the nature of the Grenville event will require revision. Evidence for a billion year old metamorphic event in the northwest U.S. would also require modification of current ideas about the configuration of continents at that time NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER FABRICATION OF TRANSPARENT WIRELESS SENSOR USING MICROMACHINED INDIUM TIN OXIDE CONDUCTIVE COATING   SUMMARY: Indium tin oxide (ITO) is known to be an optically transparent conducting coating with wide applications in optoelectronic devices such as sola NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The investigator studies the stability and instability ofequilibria in fluids and plasmas, focusing on the two-dimensionalEuler equation in fluids and on Vlasov systems in plasma physicsand stellar dynamics.  He aims to develop general methods offinding linearly growing modes (especially for asymmetric modesand boundary modes), to investigate nonlinear stability undersharp linear stability criteria and for non-monotonic equilibriathat cannot be handled by the usual energy-Casimir method, and toestablish nonlinear instability from linear instability when theparticle trajectory is non-integrable.      A plasma is a gas composed of particles, each carrying apositive or negative electrical charge, with approximately equalconcentrations of each charge.  Most of the universe is plasma;examples include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic nebulae,and comet tails.  Plasmas also arise in physics and engineering,for instance in nuclear fusion.  The investigator studies thestability and instability of equilibria in fluids and plasmas. Mathematical advances here enhance our understanding of thephysical mechanisms that govern stability and instability, and socan lead to better numerical methods for simulations of thesecomplex phenomena.  Fluid stability is important in understandingthe mechanisms of ocean waves and the movements of the atmosphereas well as in engineering applications.  Questions of plasmastability arise in areas as diverse as sunspots, fundamentalplasma physics, the design of fusion machines, and plasma displaydevices NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER MarineTech will serve 60 students in grades eight through twelve, over a period of three years, providing 144 hours of instruction and hands-on learning experiences in the fields of marine engineering and physical sciences with a shipbuilding focus. The program will run for eight Saturdays during academic years, with an additional two-week academy during the summers. MarineTech's progressive curriculum covers foundational skills and knowledge of basic physical science as it relates to ship building, through the application of these principles in a culminating ship design competition. The curriculum is enriched with program activities such as field trips to shipbuilding and repair companies, marine science museums and career day events. MarineTech concurrently targets 60 math, science, and technology education teachers for grades eight through twelve, each of whom will receive 40 hours of summer professional development and 40 hours of follow-up training and support. Teachers will work an additional 40 hours in working with their students to build underwater robots and design and build a human powered container ship for competition. Participating teachers will be fully trained in curriculum implementation and will be given materials and resources necessary to replicate MarineTech activities in their classrooms. MarineTech addresses the urgent need to enhance under-represented students' interest and performance in STEM courses, while fostering skills that are important prerequisites for STEM careers, particularly in marine engineering, physical science and information technology. In the near term, the project will incorporate activities designed to boost student scores on academic achievement measures. However, the project also addresses the critical shortage of qualified workers needed to sustain the ship building and repair industry in the USA NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual merit: U-series isotopes have revolutionized our ability to evaluate magmatic timescales and will be used in conjunction with Rb/Sr systematics to constrain the time in which large volumes of intraplate rhyolite are generated.  The timing and processes involved in the generation of silicic magmas are relevant to modeling activity at potentially explosive volcanoes, with significant climate and volcanic hazard implications. Baitoushan volcano (NE China/North Korea) is ideally suited for such studies because it has produced multiple young high silica rhyolites including a large volume (~100 km3) pyroclastic eruption as recently as ~1000 AD.  All eruptive units are sufficiently young that both short-lived 238U-230Th-226Ra and 235U-231Pa isotopic systems as well as long-lived radiogenic isotopes can be used in combination to assess magmatic timescales.  Moreover, sampling is sufficient to carry out the proposed work, thus saving on the time and cost of the proposed research. Timing of magmatic fractionation events involved in the generation of associated mafic and silicic magmas in this volcano will be evaluated through analysis of accessory phenocryst minerals. Single crystal Pb and Sr isotope analyses will also be used as tracers to quantify the effects of open-system processes such as crustal contamination, magma recharge, and post-eruption alteration. In combination these data will allow detailed assessment of such processes on the overall evolution of the volcano as well as their effects on the fidelity of the various isotopic dating methods.Broader Impacts include (1) involvement of an undergraduate into cutting-edge research in the geological sciences, (2) international collaborations, and  (3) relevance to volcanic risk assessment. Regarding the latter point,  a  seismic crisis  at Baitoushan within the last decade raised concerns that the volcano could erupt again in the near future. Better understaning of the timescale of magma evolution could be useful in predicting future activity.  Finally, Baitoushan's location on the border between China and North Korea (DPRK) has potential political significance, and contributions to understanding volcanic behavior could promote international 'good will NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER MarineTech will serve 60 students in grades eight through twelve, over a period of three years, providing 144 hours of instruction and hands-on learning experiences in the fields of marine engineering and physical sciences with a shipbuilding focus.

This research will study and recommend design elements essential for architecture and governance structures that promote interorganizational success in using these systems. This project will draw on relevant knowledge from public administration, organizational theory, and information systems. It will focus on: (1) the design of collaborative systems that explicitly address the organizational needs of the technical infrastructure and (2) interactions among the system design elements and participating organizations that can best leverage such systems. Public safety collaborations currently use either packaged or open-standards systems to support interoperability among police, fire, rescue, homeland security and other public safety agencies. Examples of the packaged software systems include those from COPLINK and Motorola. Examples of open standards systems include Pennsylvania's Justice Network (JNET), the D.C. area's Capitol Wireless Integrated Network (CapWIN) and the San Diego area's Automated Regional Justice Information System (ARJIS). The current proposal will expand upon initial empirical and theoretical work conducted by its investigators based on CapWIN, ARJIS and JNET, and other interorganizational collaborative settings.Expected contributions:The researchers identify three key reasons to focus on infrastructures for interorganizational collaboration in the public safety domain. First, such systems are exemplars of how future networked organizations that exist because of IT, and effectively use it, might look. Second, they represent some of the most innovative thinking in digital government. Third, these systems, in their design and use, have direct benefits relative to public safety. These include improved homeland security, better delivery of governmental service and safer communities, while they impart substantial scientific value relative to design principles for both collaborative systems and the organizations using them. In furthering such research, the United States will provide leadership addressing current challenges that national and international public safety organizations face. The project will employ a design-centered approach in order to achieve improved and more robust IT infrastructures to support interorganizational information sharing. It will combine detailed empirical investigation using several field-based data collection methods, and will analyze extensive secondary data available on public safety in the United States. It will synthesize existing literature across a range of relevant disciplines to support theoretical and practical design recommendations for collaborative IT infrastructure and supportive organizational governance principles and structures.The intellectual merit of the work derives from:1. Interdisciplinary insights drawn from public administration and political science, organizational information systems, and information technology.2. Empirical research design that leverages the best aspects of intensive case study and a large-sample survey.3. Focus on technical design features and architectural principles that are essential to collaborative success.4. Analysis of institutional governance structures and processes that are critical for support of successfulimplementation and operation of collaborative systems.5. Emphasis on building theory that can be generalized to many domains in which IT supports public-private collaborations.The broader impact of the work is to improve:1. Public safety and homeland security via better systems design to support information sharing.2. IT-enabled public-private collaborations, regardless of context NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This conference intends to bring a small group of Minority Serving Institution (MSI) faculty and experts in program evaluation to share lessons learned; to present new and evolving theories embedded within indigenous cultural experiences; and, to actively engage in strategizing avenues for improving capacity building and sustaining the application of responsive culturally appropriate evaluations. It is also a needs assessment focused on participant identification of needed capacity building activities in evaluation from three perspectives: their own, their institution and across Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This grant would be a follow-up to expand previous activities initiated by NSF through the Broadening Participation Initiative in Evaluation Capacity Building.  The proposed conference also would set the stage for designing and revising strategies/models and the review of their use for broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM evaluation NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a collaborative research project on the shaping of ecological and evolutionary biology at Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. The project examines the organizational structures and theoretical commitments guiding MVZ's development across the 20th century. It aims to show how MVZ's continuity in program provided a broad platform for technical and institutional change. Initiated by its first director, Joseph Grinnell, and guided by concerns about ongoing changes in native fauna and their environment, MVZ's research on vertebrates was integrated from the start with the practice of collecting specimens with diverse associated data. MVZ built on Grinnell's vision to achieve special strengths in biodiversity informatics and long-term comparative bio-geographical, ecological, and evolutionary studies, while bringing new concerns and techniques on board. The museum thus provides a window into the reconfiguration of natural history over a century of profound change. The project documents, analyzes, and makes public MVZ's history from the Grinnell era forward. It characterizes the museum as an organization initially built around a single research program. It then shows how its theories, descriptions, and procedures proved both robust and flexible as circumstances changed. The project treats the museum as a system of arrangements for studying the changing spatial distributions of populations, evolution at the species and subspecies level, and the relation of species to their varying environments.The project addresses cutting-edge themes in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science, as well as contemporary biology, integrating organizational considerations with theory construction with large-scale historical change. MVZ offers a window onto the simultaneous intellectual, organizational, and material transformations in twentieth-century American biology that are hard to grasp in the terms of a single discipline. It provides a way to track some of the complexities of evolutionary and ecological science with a high level of detail at a manageable scale. The research team's core consists of an historian, a philosopher, a biologist, and a sociologist with each having recognized expertise in the respective area of study of the biological sciences. The team also includes a research associate, the MVZ archivist, and graduate and undergraduate students, many of whom have worked on early stages of the project. The primary methodology is archival research in MVZ and other collections, with the MVZ's directors and curators forming the backbone of the account. Other sources will also be integrated. The project will produce a book, multiple scholarly articles, and a web exhibit.The team will disseminate its research results through print and web publication, and through conference presentations. It will also do so by effectively leveraging MVZ's centennial celebration. In addition to contributing to the research element of the project, the team members will promotes teaching, training, and learning at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Finally, the results of this project will serve to make MVZ into an unmatched site for reflection on the significance of the past for the present and future of university-based natural history museums. It will do so by showing MVZ to be a place where professionals and amateurs, researchers and students, and academic scientists and conservationists interacted. It will reveal connections among the vision of the museum's scientific personnel and the practices of MVZ students and staff, new ways of thinking in evolutionary biology, and concerns about disappearing native fauna shared among scientists, conservationists, hobbyists, policymakers, and other actors.Funds for this project were provided by a joint venture of the BIO and SBE directorates known as  Impacts of Biology on Society,  which is administered via the STS program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports theoretical research and education on novel quantum phases in orbital and large spin systems with cold atoms. The research explores novel quantum phases and emergent symmetries with cold atoms which are not accessible in usual solid state systems and provides guidance for new experiments. The application of symmetry principles is essential for this project which not only deepens our understanding but also provides the guidance to new discoveries.  A variety of methods in condensed matter physics and field theory are employed, including bosonization, the renormalization group, the large-N method, the self-consistent mean-field theory, and band structure calculations.The first research topic is the study of novel quantum phases in high orbital bands in optical lattices. The p-orbital bosons exhibit complex-valued many-body wave functions characterized by the formation of on-site orbital angular momentum moments. The research encompasses orbital superfluidity in various lattices which exhibit collinear ordering (e.g., staggered and stripe-like), non-collinear ordering, and ''frustrated'' distributions of orbital angular momentum moments. For fermionic orbital systems, the research will focus on the honeycomb lattice, which is a p_xy-orbital counterpart of graphene. The second research topic is the study of large spin physics with cold fermions.  Particular attention is paid to spin-3/2 systems which possess a generic SO(5) symmetry without fine tuning.  The symmetry gives rise to important consequences such as the protected degeneracy in collective excitations, new properties of the quantum Monte-Carlo sign problem, the quintet pairing superfluidity, and the four-fermion quartetting superfluidity. Planned investigations include quantum magnetism in the spin-3/2 systems and other large spin systems as well, such as the pseudospin-1 systems and the spin-5/2 systems.  The research will provide new ideas on exotic orbital superfluidity, orbital exchange physics, and emergent quantum magnetic states. It also suggests new directions for future experiments. Knowledge gained from this research deepens our understanding on strong correlation physics in both cold atom and condensed matter systems.This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems. Aspects of the research, particularly the underlying theoretical techniques, form part of the subject matter of the advanced physics courses being developed by the PI at his university.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education that seeks to predict new states of matter composed of ultracold atoms in artificial crystals of light. Researchers have found that atoms can be trapped in modulated laser beams much like electrons are trapped in the force fields of atomic nuclei in a crystalline solid. Electrons have two internal configurations; these are related to their magnetic properties. Atoms can have many more internal configurations, leading to possible new states of matter that have no counterparts in conventional materials, but have intriguing properties and may display interesting phenomena. The research develops theories to explain the novel quantum mechanical properties of these cold atoms in crystals of light. The theories provide guidance for new experiments, deepening our understanding of quantum physics and states of matter and leading to new discoveries.  This is fundamental research that lies at the interface of atomic and condensed matter physics. However, systems of cold atoms are intriguing and may hold possibilities for future technologies. Conspicuous among these is the potential to realize powerful new methods of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics. This research lies at the interface between condensed matter and cold atom physics and will benefit both fields. Students will receive training in the application of the symmetry principles and the research will stimulate students to develop broad interests and skills in the frontiers of strongly correlated systems. Aspects of the research, particularly the underlying theoretical techniques, form part of the subject matter of the advanced physics courses being developed by the PI at his university NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports theoretical research and education in a variety of subfields of statistical mechanics. This work is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences. The central theme of the effort  is a better understanding of the properties of macroscopic systems originating in the collective behavior of their microscopic constituents. The methods used range from exact mathematical analysis to computer simulations. These approaches  bridge the gap between rigorous results and applications.Research topics employed by PI and collaborators are varied.  Using mesoscopic free energy functionals allows investigation of periodic states, wetting in mixtures and droplet formation in supersaturated vapor. An ongoing effort continues on fluctuations and large deviations in nonequilibrium stationary states and partial currents. This includes cases where the hydrodynamic scaling is inadequate. Significant advance continue in fundamental studies such as  establishing Fourier?s law of heat conduction in open systems with anharmonic interactions. In quantum statistical physics,  the study of  subsystems of large quantum systems leads to understanding of when these systems have density matrices given by canonical Gibbs measures. In some cases, such as the study of ionization of model quantum systems in time periodic fields,  there are applications to laser induced transitions in atoms and molecules. Beyond physics, researchers also  apply statistical mechanical methods to the mathematical study of epidemics taking into account correlations as well as saturation effects on networks. Extension of these techniques to models of population dynamics and ecology involves derivation of reaction-diffusion equations via scaling limits and these are planned investigations.The  research activities are  highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences. The expected applications are in material science, complex fluids and in biological systems. The project also includes the organization of two conferences every year in which both core subjects and new developments in statistical mechanics are discussed in a collegial atmosphere. Graduate students, postdocs and minority scientists are involved and present talks on their work and interact with established researchers in the field. The conferences also serve as an opportunity for professional networking  and can lead to new collaborations. NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports theoretical research and education in a variety of subfields of statistical mechanics. This work is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Mathematical Sciences. The central theme of the effort  is a better understanding of the properties of material systems originating in the collective behavior of their elementary atomic constituents. The methods used range from exact mathematical analysis to computer simulations. These approaches  bridge the gap between rigorous results and applications.  Topics range from classical physics to quantum physics and highly formal to applications of technological relevance and even dynamics of disease propagation.The  research activities are  highly interdisciplinary, bringing together physicists, mathematicians, chemists and those working in theoretical areas of the biological and social sciences.

Given a knot in a closed 3-manifold, a bridge surface is a surface that decomposes the manifold into handlebodies and also cuts the knot into simple arcs. In the last year and a half Tomova has proven several important results about the behavior of bridge surfaces. She intends to extend and generalize her results and apply her work to several open problems in the area.With the discovery of the DNS molecule and the recent advent of string theory, the study of knots has come to the forefront of modern science. Knot Theory is a subarea of Topology which studies the properties of knotted strings and is the main area of interest of Maggy Tomova. Her study of knots also requires an understanding of 3-manifolds, objects that locally look like 3-dimensional space NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Phylogenetic trees, which depict the genealogical relationships of organisms to each other, are a key tool for organizing and analyzing information about biological diversity. Trees are used by many researchers in comparative biology and the demand for them is high. The proposed research will take advantage of the phenomenal breadth of data in the GenBank molecular sequence database (currently including sequences from 185,000 species, or some 10% of all species known to science) to build an electronic repository of one billion phylogenetic trees. The goal of this research is to build a very large number of phylogenetic trees and then construct simple search and retrieval tools to match these trees to any query list of species in which a user may be interested.The primary impact of this research will be outside of the phylogenetics research community. Users of phylogenetic trees span most areas of modern biology: epidemiologists, genomicists, functional morphologists, conservation biologists, and community ecologists, to name a few. A repository of molecular phylogenies built using a consistent methodology, and satisfying prescribed minimal levels of statistical confidence, will provide users a level of consistency needed for strong inferences within and between comparative biological studies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER With support from the National Science Foundation, a major social neuroscience conference will be held November 21-22, 2008 at the science museum of the Caixa Foundation, Barcelona, Spain. The overarching goal of the conference will be to examine our most fundamental human impulses--the motives to affiliate, cooperate and empathize as opposed to ostracize, compete and aggress--from the perspective of social neuroscience. Social neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates behavioral and biological theories and techniques from many sister disciplines to understand the mechanisms underlying human social behavior. Across three core symposia, participants will examine cooperation and conflict at the level of biological systems, including studies of genetic markers and brain circuits, the level of individual behavior, including biological and behavioral models of cooperation and conflict, and the level of the group, including studies of intergroup conflict and terrorism. The symposium will bring together international leaders and young investigators in neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, economics, sociology and policy. This conference is anticipated to increase communication and subsequent collaboration between complementary research groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Meritorious patents are a principal currency of an innovation-driven society.  They create an incentive for the production of novel inventions.  But the integrity of the patent system is compromised when, as the Commissioner of Patents has noted, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) lacks optimized informational resources to determine if a patent application reflects a new and non-obvious invention, as the law requires. To date, scientific researchers have been unable to help the USPTO find the information it needs. The arcane language of patent applications conveys insufficient information to enable effective communication among patent professionals and the community of scientists and others in the public who would otherwise provide valuable information and insight to the USPTO.  Tagging and visualization, two software-driven techniques that are used to enhance access to digital information, are in common use in commerce, but they have yet to be applied to a vast store of scientific information in the public sphere, including patents. Tagging is the process by which a keyword is assigned to an item of information; it describes the information and allows it to be readily searched (e.g. labeling photos on web-based photo-sharing services).   By tagging different information with the same tag, associations can be made.  Visualization refers to a variety of techniques for graphically representing relationships (e.g. graphical representations of census data or voting patters).  These two tools of tagging and visualization open great opportunities for using science to unlock essential information and make it available in a useable form that will benefit government, the scientific community and the public.The Open Patent project, based at New York Law School's Center for Patent Innovation, studies the application of tagging and visualization tools in the context of patents.   This project builds on New York Law School's Peer-to-Patent pilot program, which it created in 2006, and launched in 2007, in cooperation with the USPTO to improve the quality of information available to patent examiners through on-line public participation. Using social networking tools, the Peer-to-Patent website enables self-selecting technical experts to identify and submit bibliographic information, known as prior art, relevant to examining the claims of the patent application.  Data from the first year of Peer-to-Patent demonstrates that the public can, and does, contribute information that assists patent examiners in more effectively determining patent eligibility. Using data developed through the Peer-to-Patent project, the Open Patent project takes as its premise that, for the patent system to continue to promote science and innovation, new scientific tools are necessary to enable: patent examiners to understand the claims of an application for which a patent is sought; competitors to know the scope of a granted patent in order to innovate around it; and the scientific and technical public to find and discuss patents related to their research.  The Open Patent project takes advantage of information generated by reviewers in the Peer-to-Patent project to study the effects of user-generated tagging and visualization on the exchange of information in the patent process.  Experts from law, political science, information and computer science, library science and design are engaged in developing user interfaces for the development of these tags.  The new approach should enable patent examiners and the participating public to readily define and perceive patterns of association among information relevant to patents.  The hypothesis to be tested is whether enabling public tagging of patents and applications will: 1) enable scientific research communities to develop knowledge bases of patents relating to their area of research; 2) produce a demonstrable increase in rates of public participation by the scientific community in the USPTO public patent review program; and 3) enable patent examiners to identify more relevant information to assist with the patent examination process.Broader Impacts:  This research has ramifications for improving the quality of issued patents and the exchange of information between a government agency and the scientific public, on an international basis. In addition, this research develops  new models, analytic tools and datasets that can also be applied in the science policy decision-making process in many other domains NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Collaborative Research: Project IBORC: Interaction between Building and Occupant Responses during Collapse Abstract The primary objective of this project is to conduct a multidisciplinary investigation ? at the intersection of structural engineering, social science, and computer science ? of how building occupants respond to signals issued by a building during and immediately after a compromising event that threatens its integrity. Other secondary objectives are to investigate: 1) how the response of victims is modulated by their social conditions at the time of the incident; and 2) the influence of a building?s structural system on building collapse response and occupant survival rates. Computational simulation models will be developed to represent building collapse and Agent Based Models (ABMs) will be used to model human response within the building models. Existing information will be sought in an effort to formulate basic rules that govern human response during times of extreme danger. The developed models will be calibrated and validated by comparisons to well documented events that involved building collapse. The developed models will then be used to clarify how building occupants respond during emergencies through extensive parametric simulations. The models will also be used to investigate how buildings collapse and to identify the means by which to mitigate building failure and its effects. This project will lead to the education of a new generation of researchers skilled in inter-disciplinary research. The project will furthermore contribute to the state-of-the-art in hazards research by developing knowledge that could form the basis of public education and awareness programs to help building occupants, their rescuers and city officials respond appropriately during extreme events NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Innovation is becoming more open, often involving multiple organizations in a division of innovative labor (DoIL).  The division of innovative labor in the economy is conceived of as the distribution across firms and other organizations of the following steps in the innovation process: 1) research/idea generation; 2) development; and 3) commercialization.  Despite its importance, there is little broad-based, systematic evidence on the extent or nature of the DoIL, nor on its impact on firm performance or the rate of technical advance.  The project collects the first systematic data on the DoIL for the United States by surveying over 20,000 firms in manufacturing and selected service industries,.   The collected data quantifies key features of the DoIL.  It also provides the basis for developing and empirically testing models of the DoIL and its effects on innovative performance.  The project addresses a number of important questions, such as the extent to which startups, as compared to established firms, are generators of new ideas, the importance of universities as sources of industrial innovation, and the extent to which firms' use of external knowledge inputs increases their innovative performance. Finally, the research advances the economics of innovation by generating formal models that capture the DoIL and testing those models empirically.Broader Impacts: This project is the first national effort to collect data on innovative activity generally, going beyond R&D and patenting. It is an important addition to the data infrastructure required for a science of science and innovation policy.  By generating new data on innovative activity, creating new metrics, and developing new models of the innovation process, the research also informs both public policy and firm strategy.  The research should contribute to deliberations on intellectual property policy and policies on standards and cooperative research and development agreements that potentially affect the growth of technology markets and the DoIL.  By highlighting the role of small firms, startups, and universities in the innovation process, the findings should also help inform federal support to university research and new firm formation.  The project findings should also contribute to the federal government's ongoing efforts to improve its collection of data on industrial R&D and innovation.  The research also contributes to the management of innovation by highlighting the returns to extramural knowledge sourcing, or strategic alliances formed to develop or commercialize new technologies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Explaining the Education Effect and the Demography of Risk: Comparing Unschooled and Schooled on Everyday Reasoning and Decision-making Skills about Health BehaviorCO-PIs: David Baker, Penn State University; Martin Benavides, The Group for Analysis of Development, Lima Peru; Ellen Peters, Decision Research, Eugene OR AbstractThis multidisciplinary project combines cognitive science and the psychology of decision making with cross-cultural sociology of education to test how formal schooling influences reasoning and decision-making skills used to navigate everyday health risks.  Basic education is now rapidly expanding around the world, and demographic literature brims with results showing the robust positive association between formal schooling and health. The education effect is so large that education is often assumed to be a major cause of the demographic transition of modern society, which consists of reduced mortality and fertility, and longer life spans. While most demographers and health researchers acknowledge the persistent and significant association between formal schooling and positive health outcomes, why education has this influence is not well understood and a multidisciplinary investigation of how this effect occurs is the chief intellectual merit of the proposed study. It is hypothesized that schooling, through the teaching of subjects like mathematics, enhances reasoning, risk-assessment and decision-making skills that schooled individuals bring to bear on everyday health risks. The innovation of the proposed project is that it tests an explanation of education?s association with health by comparing unschooled and moderately schooled adults on their numeracy ability, cognitive skill, reasoning about risk, and decision-making skills related to health behaviors in the Peruvian Andes, where local conditions allow for a found-quasi-experiment on the effects of education. Broader impacts of this project include the potential to design more effective education for the significant parts of the world that have yet to reap the health benefits of the demographic transition and must do so rapidly to emerge out of the extreme poverty that hinders their long-term development. Hypothesizing links between schooling and basic cognitive-skill enhancement and, through them, improved decision making is a new approach to considering the wide impact of schooling on health behavior, a major social issue facing the future of human society.  Many non-government organizations are attempting to use various educational approaches to improve individuals? health decisions in poor nations. Without a clear understanding of how to make the most of limited education resources, these efforts will not yield the positive social change envisioned NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Over the past century, rapid growth of human population and the human economy has transformed landscapes around the world.  These transformations have reduced and fragmented natural habitat, resulting in loss of biodiversity and many ecosystem services.  Maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services while meeting the needs of human society for food, fiber, fuel, and other essentials requires integrated assessment of the biological and economic consequences of land use and land management.  This interdisciplinary research project will develop and apply an integrated dynamic landscape-modeling approach to predict and compare how alternative policy incentives and market forces affect land-use decisions; how resulting land-use changes affect species conservation, carbon storage, and the value of commodity production; and how this will affect future land-use decisions.  The investigators will approach these questions by developing statistical models based on observed landowner behavior in order to predict likely land-use changes as a function of current land-use conditions, public policy, and market opportunities.  Land-use changes have consequences for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic returns.  Land-use patterns shaped by these decisions will serve as input into models that predict the status of species, the flow of ecosystem services, and the value of commodity production from the landscape.  Current land-use decisions and the resulting set of consequences will set the stage for future conditions that shape future policies and market opportunities, which, in turn, will affect future land-use changes.  This integrated approach will be used to analyze the likely effect of alternative policies on land-use change dynamics, the consequent trajectory for species conservation, ecosystem services, and economic activities on the landscape.  The integrated dynamic landscape modeling approach will be applied to landscapes at several geographic scales, from the 48 contiguous states to regional analysis applied to the Willamette Basin in Oregon and the Northern Lakes Region in Wisconsin.  Two questions will be addressed by using different scales of analysis within the same modeling approach:  (1) How much difference does inclusion of increased detail and spatial resolution make to the analysis and results?, and (2) Can analyses be nested in the sense that one can use the broad-scale analysis to highlight areas and species of concern, at which point more detailed analysis can be undertaken using finer scale analysis?Conserving biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem services necessary for human welfare in the long-run in the midst of a growing human economy with pressing current needs requires careful planning based on an understanding of the full set of consequences of human choices and actions.  This project will integrate economic and ecological research into a coherent framework to predict landscape dynamics and the effects of these dynamics on biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and economic production.  The integrated landscape model developed in this project will provide tools and insights that can be used to improve decision making by a broad range of stakeholders.  By facilitating careful thinking about the pattern, extent, and intensity of human activities across the landscape through time, this project may help landowners and policy makers to achieve important species conservation and ecosystem service objectives while also generating high economic returns over the long term.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Broad changes in urban structure have caused increased concentrations of poverty in the United States. Research over the last 25 years has demonstrated effects of neighborhood context on individual and social outcomes, including educational performance and attainment, risky behavior and health, child bearing, and family structure and decision making.  In response, extensive local public policy and investment has been directed at low income neighborhoods, often called economic or community  development,  with the goal of changing neighborhoods and improving individual well being. However, there has been little scientific research on the impact of these investments and policies. Previous studies have compared outcomes in different neighborhoods, or studied people who move from one neighborhood to another.  This study focuses on the same neighborhood before and after significant publicly-driven investment.In the study, observations of neighborhood conditions, responses on household surveys, results from economic experiments, reports from students, parents and teachers, and administrative school district data are collected.  This study exploits geographic location to test how publicly-driven investment changes the physical and social landscape of a neighborhood and the well-being of its residents.  This study takes advantage of a unique opportunity to study a poor neighborhood in Dallas, Texas that will experience significant public investment within the next five years, including a light rail project that will bring three stations.  In addition, transit oriented development zoning, philanthropic and nonprofit activities, a HOPE VI award, and tax increment financing districts will encourage private investors to develop the neighborhood.  We expect that these projects will drive significant change especially around the stations, while change will be less dramatic as distance from the stations increases, creating  treatment and control groups  for comparison and implementing a scientifically valid study. The neighborhood is primarily African-American and Hispanic and the research involves African-American and Hispanic student research assistants for data collection and research support.  Additionally, community-based workers participate in the collection of data. Our documentation of the impacts of publicly-driven investment in a poor urban neighborhood will yield valuable insights to city planners and policy makers. The data is of interest to other social and behavioral scientists, including researchers in public health, education, and many other fields.  The results illuminate the costs and benefits of public investment for neighborhood change NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRL-0833517PI: Joan AbdallahInstitution: American Association for the Advancement of ScienceTitle: GET SET Global Education for Tomorrow in Science, Engineering, and TechnologyThis project focuses research on understanding what it takes to get underrepresented students to succeed in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as its central goal. It is implementing and testing an instructional model for 2,000 6-8th grade students in ten Washington, DC public, charter schools to increase student interest in and pursuit of careers in engineering and other STEM areas, with a focus on energy and renewable resources. Students may also apply for out-of-school learning activities, including engineering clubs, summer institutes, and career exploration. Thirty teachers and ten counselors are receiving professional development to implement the project in their schools. Research is focusing on the  dosage  and  duration  of the interventions by controlling these two variables. Students in the 6th grade at the start of the project are experiencing 3 years of participation, while the 8th graders have only one year. The activities completed by different cohorts of students also are being varied NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Quantitative Social Science Digital Library (QSSDL) Pathway provides a portal to materials and modules that integrate quantitative analysis with the teaching of the social sciences. QSSDL is a partnership of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Social Science Data Analysis Network, both at the University of Michigan, and the American Sociological Association, the American Political Science Association, and the Association of American Geographers.  Quantitative analysis has long played a key role in social science research. Influential voices have been calling for ways make data analysis a staple feature in a large variety of courses in the social sciences, including introductory courses.  This pathway is designed to help instructors find high quality teaching materials and datasets for student exercises and research. It is building on the rapid acceleration in the availability of data, the creation of new educational tools, and growing interest by instructors in making innovative use of digital resources for instruction. The integration of this social science pathway into the portfolio of NSDL Pathway projects adds a new resource to the existing networked infrastructure of repositories and professional associations. Experts in the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College are providing pedagogical, assessment, and evaluation services.  In particular, SERC is conducting evaluations that include pre- and post-intervention assessments of faculty use of QSSDL resources on ten selected campuses, and QSSDL teaching materials are being linked to the  Pedagogy in Action  server at SERC. The QSSDL Pathway helps individuals who create resources by providing archiving and preservation services for those lacking adequate institutional support.  This project also builds on ICPSR's long and successful model of sustainability, which is based on a diverse portfolio of memberships held by colleges and universities, research grants, and contracts NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports theoretical research and education with an aim to advance understanding of how classical dynamics arises from quantum mechanical dynamics. The quest to demonstrate behavior described by quantum mechanics in the mechanical properties of nanoscale and larger structures is of fundamental significance for understanding how the macroscopic classical world emerges by approximation from the quantum world, as well as for advancing the state of the art in ultrasensitive measurement technology. Experimental efforts are currently underway that employ either optomechanical or solid state electromechanical schemes to realize these goals. In the former schemes, the quantum coherent nature of optical cavity modes are employed to drive a typically larger-than-micronscale mechanically compliant mirror into a nonclassical state, as well as to measure this state. In the latter schemes, a controllable quantum coherent superconducting device drives a nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonator into a nonclassical state via capacitive or inductive coupling, as well as measures this state.This research project consists of three interrelated thrusts that are particularly relevant to the superconducting device schemes, commonly called ?Quantum Electromechanical Systems.? The first thrust will investigate the significance of nonlinearities in amplifier dynamics for approaching the quantum limit of displacement detection, as well as for the related issue of using detector back-action to cool the mechanical resonator to its quantum ground state. The second thrust will address the contribution of tunneling two level system defects to the damping and decoherence rates of nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonators at dilution fridge and lower temperatures. The third thrust will analyze schemes to generate and detect entangled and superposition states of nano-to-micronscale mechanical resonators, as well as measure their decoherence rates. The schemes involve superconducting qubits embedded within microwave cavities that are employed for both qubit state control and readout. This theoretical research project is closely linked to experiments.The activity outlined in project one will provide training for a graduate student in theoretical physics. Projects two and three are intended for two rising junior undergraduates with an introductory-level understanding of quantum mechanics. Through working on the projects during their junior and senior years, they will graduate with a relatively advanced understanding of open system quantum dynamics.Non-Technical Summary:This award supports theoretical research and education with an aim to advance our understanding of how the familiar world governed by classical mechanics emerges from the seemingly counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics that describe phenomena on the scale of atoms and across even smaller length scales. In close connection with experiment, the PI will study tiny mechanical resonators that are driven to oscillate by devices that are described by the rules of quantum mechanics. The operation of this sort resonator device lies at what seems like an interface between the world governed by classical mechanics and that governed by quantum mechanics. The study of these kinds of systems advances fundamental knowledge and also addresses some very practical questions, including: What are the fundamental limits of measurement? What is the most sensitive measurement device that can be made? Questions of this kind become more pressing as our science and technology press to every smaller length scales with the vision of devices, electronic and mechanical, that are perhaps only few atoms in one or more dimensions and somehow have one aspect that appears squarely in the world of quantum mechanics and others that appear to be squarely in the world of classical mechanics.This research will provide valuable educational experiences for a graduate student in theoretical physics, as well as for junior undergraduate students with an introductory-level understanding of quantum mechanics. Through working on the projects during their junior and senior years, the undergraduate students will graduate with a relatively advanced understanding of dynamics at the ?divide? between classical and quantum mechanics NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is using nanotechnology to recruit new science majors and prepare them for careers in this field.  Students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in Applied Physics or in any science discipline with either a minor in Nanotechnology or an AAS in Nanotechnology as a second degree, receive scholarships based on financial need (mean = $5632/year), and a one-time scholarship to attend the Nanomanufacturing Technology Semester at Pensylvania State University's Advanced Technical Education Center ($4110).  Through the First Year Excellence Program students (n=21) participate in a tightly knit learning community built around small, dynamic classes and weekly discussion and activity groups led by upper division honors students.  The program supplements existing recruitment and student support services for populations underrepresented in science and technology. Inherently interdisciplinary, nanotechnology offers opportunities for collaboration across disciplines and is an ideal focal point to attract students to all sciences. Peer mentors, faculty support from the interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Group, and research opportunities provide the societal and implementation context that science courses often lack NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0847752PI- Gert CauwenberghsABSTRACTThis exploratory research project aims to observe and augment the learning experiences of children through non-intrusive acquisition,  on-line analysis and interpretation of their brain dynamics.  Current systems for recording high-resolution encephalogram (EEG) dynamical brain activity are not suitable for this purpose because they distract the children and constrain their mobility by excessive wiring between electrodes and computer.  Existing methods are also not useful because of unreliable contact between electrodes and scalp during body motion.  This two-year project specifically entails the design and implementation of a low-weight wearable, wireless EEG recording system with 128 embedded non-contact electrodes.  This will include supporting software for real-time analysis and display of brain dynamics on a host computer.  The research will give rise to new methods for non-intrusive acquisition and on-line interpretation of brain dynamics, and open up new research directions not possible using existing methods.  The project supports inter-disciplinary graduate research combining biophysics of EEG, engineering of non-contact and wireless sensors, independent component analysis, cognitive neuroscience, and the temporal dynamics of learning.Outcomes of this research will contribute to the broader understanding of brain function at a level combining cognitive neuroscience and social dynamics.  A diverse and interdisciplinary body of students at the NSF Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center (TDLC) and the Institute of Neural Computation at UCSD will take part in applying the instrumentation to learning research in the biological, cognitive and social sciences.  The wireless EEG infra-structure also significantly enhances the mobility of EEG recording in existing motion-capture facilities at TDLC, allowing the study of learning in dynamic environments with freely interacting subjects.  The project will further benefit from outreach channels supported by the TDLC, including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Hughes Scholar Program (HSP), and the Preuss High School at UCSD NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER FETCH with Ruff Ruffman is a daily half-hour PBS television series with accompanying Web and outreach activities targeted to 6- to 10-year olds. The program brings science learning to young children by uniquely blending live-action with animation, game show convention with reality programming, and humor with academics. The intended impacts are to 1) help the target audience develop interest, knowledge and skills necessary to do science; 2) train afterschool leaders to better facilitate science activities with kids; and 3) demonstrate how media can be used to teach substantive science and share the results of project evaluation with others in the field. The requested funds will allow the project to expand the science curriculum with 20 new half-hour episodes and expand the Web site, focusing on three new science themes that highlight topics of interest to this age group. The Web site will include four new science-based Web games that will allow kids to create and post content of their own design and contribute to nationwide data collection. A new FETCH Online Training resource will be created to help afterschool leaders to effectively engage in FETCH's hands-on science activities. American Institutes for Research (AIR) will conduct summative evaluation of the Online Training program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER NASA/OAI Pre-Service Teacher Institute (PSTI) OAI proposed herein to conduct a Pre-Service Teacher Workshop at Glenn Research Center, in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)  s educational program goals.

Three key research areas include (1) develop new nanocluster chemistries using abundant, environmentally benign metals;(2) use these chemistries to produce previously unrealized nanostructured laminates and composites; (3) apply these chemistries to the fabrication of vertical transport transistors.Aqueous-based processing of functional inorganic films can reduce the costs of electronics manufacturing and enable the use of large-area substrates while simultaneously reducing chemical hazards and waste. The Center has strong industry partnerships. The Center Education Plan will promote early entry and short time to degree, broadened perspectives, and collaborative mentorships. The Outreach Plan includes the production of captivating imagery and videos to illustrate technically demanding material and the human element of science. The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation. These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This interdisciplinary research project, funded by the Science, Technology, and Society Program, seeks to better understand the social consequences of surveillance.  The growing prevalence of surveillance, facilitated by increasingly sophisticated information technologies, is well documented. However, the social implications for democratic societies of so much tracking, monitoring, and sorting of individual behavior is less well-understood.  At the same time, interest in transparency policies is growing in calls for more transparency of government and corporate practices.  Transparency is seen as a remedy for the negative effects of surveillance.  This project reframes surveillance and transparency in viewing them both as systems of accountability.  Accountability provides a novel lens through which to view the normative structures of these two systems and will be understood to involve: (1) an individual or organization; (2) an account of that individual or organization, focused on a particular domain of activity; and (3) a group, organization, or individual that uses the account to make decisions.  Further, surveillance and transparency will be analyzed as sociotechnical systems: the social structures and cultural meanings constitute, and are in turn constituted by, the information technology systems in which they are realized.  This framework will guide the creation of five case studies which will provide the basis for analysis and cross-comparison.  The five cases cover government, corporate and non-profit organizations.  An interdisciplinary team of scholars will analyze the cases and do the cross-case comparisons, yielding both new insights into transparency and new understandings of the social implications of surveillance.  These analyses will examine how the rationales for creation of systems gets translated into their actual workings; how IT has an impact on that translation; and how the systems affect underrepresented groups in science and engineering NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0808851Fort Valley State University, a HBCU and an 1890 Land-grant institution has an average student enrollment of 2,100 over the past five years. About 92 percent of enrolled and graduating students are African American minorities. Minorities are under represented in the fields of sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics. This under representation of African Americans is more severe in certain sciences, such as Entomology, where out of 5,000 registered members of the Entomological Society of America only 32 are African Americans. Entomology, the study of insects, is very important due to the impact of insects on agriculture and public health. In the U.S. insect activities, and human activities aimed at reducing insect population is estimated at an annual cost of about $50 billion. This project works to strengthen both the teaching and training of students in Entomology by integrating advances in Chemical Ecology of Insects, and Insect Pathology in the Entomology program at FVSU. We are focusing on chemical ecology and insect pathology because these are emerging technologies within entomology that bring with them certain important and basic skills such as in microbiology, biotechnology, biochemistry and chemistry. This is introduced through several objectives: (1) Enrich the academic preparations of Entomology students by developing course reforms that include laboratory experiences (2) Enhance quality research experience for Entomology students at FVSU that help students get accepted into graduate programs (3) Institute integrated pest management activities that arms students with the skills they need to secure employment in agriculture or pest control industry NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER NUMBER: 0802184INSTITUTION: Florida International UniversityNSF PROGRAM: PHY ?

This Center is a research, education, and outreach program that has, in its first five years, established a durable and vibrant learning community of high school teachers, high school students, university students, scientists, faculty, and associated stake-holders that continues to attract science and math students, using the project?s cutting-edge science and advanced cyberinfrastructure as compelling elements of study. An education and research partnership derived from basic research in particle physics (based on the CMS experiment at CERN), grid computing, and advanced networking- transforming the undergraduate experience through modeling-based, guided-inquiry introductory physics classes, a fellowship program, and the establishment of the Physics Learning Center (PLC), CHEPREO is proposed to continue and expand its research, education and outreach for another five years through NSF support, thereby extending the impact of this national resource even further NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The exchange of carbon between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle.  Movement of terrestrial carbon from land to water represents a loss of carbon from the former and a gain for the latter, and these changes must be taken into account when determining the net carbon balance of either system.  In most terrestrial carbon cycle studies, the magnitude of this loss has not been determined, possibly resulting in an over-estimation of carbon storage in the terrestrial system.  If the carbon that enters the aquatic system is eventually respired, or lost to the atmosphere, then this is a potentially serious error in calculations of regional and global carbon cycling.  The specific goal of this project is to determine the age of terrestrially-derived carbon from forests in Massachusetts and the subsequent metabolic fate of this carbon in adjacent aquatic systems over seasonal and annual cycles.  A multi-disciplinary approach will employ a variety of biochemical and analytical techniques to determine the age and fate of soil carbon.  The research will have important implications for decision makes and managers who are interested in maximizing net carbon storage within particular regions.  Outreach efforts will focus on the concept of connectivity between inland ecosystems and downstream estuaries and the coastal zone.  The focus will be on improving the coverage of concepts and topics in aquatic ecology in curricula for K-12 education.  The principle investigator is partnered with the Math and Science Center of Virginia.  Three teacher-student teams consisting of one high school biology or earth science teacher and four 10th grade students, with priority given to students from under-represented groups, will participate in a  two-week, field-oriented institute to educate and provide research experiences NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In most areas of human knowledge, the information revolution has resulted in a massive data explosion. The scale of data sets, their distributed and heterogeneous nature, and the need to quickly deliver results easily interpretable by non-experts, raise new theoretical and computational challenges for statistical learning, from variable selection and structural inference to visualization and online learning. This project uses sparse statistical inference as a powerful approach to meet these challenges. Its key insight is that seeking sparsity is a meaningful way of simultaneously stabilizing inference procedures, and highlighting structure in the underlying data. This work thus combines fundamental advances in sparse statistical learning with cutting-edge computational tools from mathematical programming to create a new framework for structural knowledge discovery in large-scale, streaming data sets. It is focused on two fundamental themes in sparse inference: variable selection and structural inference. Variable selection seeks to isolate a few key variables from high dimensional data sets and is a fundamental preprocessing tool in statistical learning. Structural inference then aims to consistently identify a few core dependence relationships among these variables to highlight its structure. From a computational point of view, many recent results in machine learning have relied on advanced methods from convex optimization such as semidefinite programming and robust optimization and this project seeks to improve the complexity of these algorithms and their capacity to handle very-large scale, streaming data. In practice, this project is motivated by the desire to help the public understand our democracies by analyzing large-scale political and social data sets, with a particular focus on voting records, online news sources, and polling data. Its approach is to apply statistical inference principles to social sciences, using collaborations with experts in political science and economics to forge the models and techniques under study. In carrying out the research, this project will be training graduate students from statistics, electrical engineering/financial engineering into interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of statistics, optimization, and subject matter areas such as finance and political science. In addition we plan to develop a web site, accessible first to a restricted set of social science researchers, to allow them to analyze mid-sized corpora of online news in text format, in the form of say, sparse graphs of words showing statistical associations between given keywords. The PIs plan to develop a software toolbox implementing these results, interfaced with common numerical packages such as MATLAB, R or python as well as an undergraduate course on ``Statistical Analysis of Online Data  at Berkeley and Princeton, incorporating some of the material produced in this project into the course program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Study of Emerging Networks in Outbreak ResponsePrincipal Investigators: Christopher Ansell, Ann Keller, Art ReingoldWith an increasing global population and greater ease of transportation, the threat of infectious disease pandemics is larger than it has been in the past.  Infectious diseases have the potential to spread rapidly across national borders.  In order to respond effectively, governments, experts, and organizations must be able to coordinate information and activities with one another.  Yet, no two outbreaks are alike which makes it difficult for organizations to take advantage of past experience to guide them in the face of a new outbreak.  This is especially true when the outbreak involves a new disease.   Information about the number and distribution of cases is rarely complete and little may be known about the disease itself and how it spreads.  In such cases, experts have to learn about the disease as it occurs and face many uncertainties that make communication and decision-making difficult.  Under these conditions, participants face substantial challenges in mobilizing a coordinated, effective response.  This study makes use of an international team of researchers who will study the actors in key organizations as they respond to any significant disease outbreak that occurs during the study period.  The project will use an internet survey to collect information from key participants as an outbreak occurs.  In addition, researchers will bring together the major participants of an outbreak after the event to discuss the event itself and the information collected on-line. The researchers will then analyze this information to learn about the nature of the interactions between individuals, organizations, and countries as they attempted to share information and coordinate activities to mobilize an effective response.  This study will significantly improve our understanding of the interactions among participants by gathering information about outbreak response efforts as they occur.  This represents an improvement over existing studies that attempt to recreate the significant events of an outbreak after the outbreak ended.  By studying the events as they occur, this research will provide a more accurate picture of the problems that arise as individuals, organizations, and governments who mobilize in response to an international outbreak attempt to coordinate their activities.  By learning more about the successes and pitfalls associated with international outbreak response, this research will develop strategies to improve the way that the international community manages infectious disease outbreaks that cross national borders NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this activity relates to continuing the search for ancient biomaterials trapped in primary halite crystals of significant geological age. These live organisms, DNA and/or viruses represent the state of evolution during each of the ages represented by the salts. They are also significant study materials for issues of long-term survival of microbial species and the possible movement of microorganisms from planet to planet across space. Recent research has shown that halophilic microorganisms can be isolated from brine inclusions in salt crystals of variousages (Norton and Grant 1988, Vreeland et al. 2000) and that fragments of bacterial and haloarcheal DNA can be recovered from fluid inclusions in ancient halite (Fish et al. 2002, Park et al. 2008 PNAS submitted). These reports are only the latest in a series of announcements made over the last century (Namyslowski 1919, Dombrowski 1961, Tasch 1963, Reiser and Tasch 1960). One study (Vreeland et al. 2000) has received significant publicity because of the extreme sterilization techniques used to avoid contamination by modern microorganisms. The 250-million-year-old Virgibacillus (strain 2-9-3) reported by Vreeland et al. (2000) has profound implications for long-term survival on Earth and for finding life on planets such as Mars. This project will continue to advance these fascinating discoveries. The research will be conducted in two different Permian-aged salt formations in an attempt to duplicate the original NSF funded discovery. Further, the project will gather additional samples from even older formations (Devonian 320 million years of age; Silurian 412 MYA) in an attempt to document sound evidence for even longer term survival in primary halite minerals. Due to the excellent preservation of the sites, vertical samples will also be obtained from an entire evaporation cycle in order to examine population differences that might have occurred as the saline chemistry of the ancient lakes changed over time. In addition, the project will examine these same layers in different horizontal samples of each of the mines in order to develop data regarding the spatial distribution of biological materials in each of the formations. The microbial populations in these various formations will be studied using both culture dependent and independent assays. Consequently, this project will provide data on the types of microbes that are able to survive within the salts while concurrently providing the first systematic DNA-based survey of microbial diversity within the formations and that may have been present during the original precipitation of the salt formations. The project also includes the first examination of these primary salt brines for the presence of bacterial viruses trapped within the ancient brines that formed the fluid inclusions within the crystals. Broader Impact: The project has many broad areas of impact including the support and training of several research interns, supporting training for several K-12 teachers in a joint educational effort between the PI and the Kansas Underground salt museum, and providing training in geobiology to a current NSF minority Post-Doctoral fellow who has expressed a sincere desire to become involved in the rapidly developing field of geological microbiology with a specific interest in the study of ancient biomaterials. In addition, the research focuses on an area of great public interest as it seeks to break the current record for the oldest live organism known while at the same time attempting to duplicate previous work that isolated the current record, a Permian aged microbe (ca. 250 MYA NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This MSP-Start Partnership, led by Widener University, in partnership with Bryn Mawr College, Delaware County Community College, Philadelphia University, Lincoln University, and Haverford Township School District, is developing the Greater Philadelphia Environment, Energy, and Sustainability Science (ES)2 Teacher Leader Institute. Additional partners include the Center for Social and Economic Research at West Chester University, Delaware Valley Industrial Resource Center, Energy Coordinating Agency, US EPA Region 3 Office of Innovation, National Center for Science and Civic Engagement and its SENCER program, Pennsylvania Campus Compact, Philadelphia Higher Education Network for Neighborhood Development, Project Kaleidoscope, Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia, and the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education. Building on a base of relationships developed over the past five years by many partners in the Math Science Partnership of Greater Philadelphia, the project brings together faculty and resources from multiple institutions (a  Mega-University  model) to develop a coherent, innovative, and content-rich, multi-year curriculum in environment, energy, and sustainability science for an Institute that leads to a newly developed Master's degree. Teachers participating in the Institute  (A) improve their STEM content knowledge in areas critical to human environmental sustainability, (B) improve their use of project based/service learning and scientific teaching pedagogies in their teaching, (C) engage in real-world sustainability problem solving in an externship with a local business, non-profit or government organization that is active in the newly emerging green economy, and (D) develop important leadership skills as change agents in their schools to  improve student interest, learning, and engagement in STEM education. The Institute aims to serve as a regional hub, connecting educational, business, non-profit and government organizations to strengthen the STEM education and workforce development pipelines in the region and simultaneously support positive social change toward environmental sustainability and citizenship. The project's  Mega-University  and  Institute as a regional connector-hub  approaches are powerful models of collaboration that could have widespread and significant national applicability as organizations and systems adjust to the new challenges of our global economy and to the needed transition to sustainability NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Tsunamis are oceanic waves with long wavelengths, long periods, and high velocities, and are most commonly caused by catastrophic displacement of the water column by submarine fault movements, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or the marine impact of extraterrestrial bodies. Energy conserved during wave propagation in the deep ocean is translated to wave height as tsunami waves cross the continental margins, and is gradually dissipated through friction with the sediment substrate. Although mobilization of the substrate can occur over wide areas of the continental shelf, the most devastating effects of tsunami occur during wave inundation of coastal zones, which experience significant erosion and transport of sediment that is then deposited en masse in inland zones, and during tsunami back-surge, which can result in additional erosion and seaward transport of sedimentary materials. Despite their frequent recurrence and their potentially extraordinary sedimentologic effect, our understanding of tsunami deposits is largely restricted to Holocene and younger deposits. Although more ancient geologic deposits have been attributed to tsunami waves, only recently has the detailed analysis of wave behavior and related sedimentary deposition permitted a more systematic compilation of sedimentary signatures that can be ascribed to processes acting during passage of a tsunami wave-train. Within such a framework, detailed analysis of ancient tsunami deposits potentially allow differentiation of specific tsunami processes. The largest deposits (i.e. mega-tsunami deposits), if well preserved in terms of their stratigraphic thickness, stratigraphic variability, and lateral extent, may even provide sufficient data to differentiate among potential tsunamigenic source mechanisms. Carbonate strata within the Proterozoic Atar Group, Mauritania, contain a 4 to 6 meter-thick breccia interval that has been attributed previously to seismic liquefaction. The wide lateral extent of deposits over a thousand kilometers across the West African craton, as well the presence of amalgamated beds with distinct intrabreccia scours, variable clast grading, and indication of bi-directional imbrication, suggests formation via passage of a series of anomalously large waves (e.g. a tsunami wave-train). Furthermore, facies reconstruction indicates transport of meter-scale boulders up to 150 km across a shallow cratonal seaway, suggesting a tsunamigenic source of extraordinary magnitude. This project, a collaboration between the University of Tennessee Knoxville and Ohio University, will carry out a detailed sedimentologic, petrographic, and geochemical analysis of these deposits to characterize the sedimentological effect of tsunami processes, to explore tsunami behavior and energy depletion in a shallow epicratonic seaway, and test the hypothesis that the wave energy originated from a marine extraterrestrial impact. This project aims to advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by linking sedimentologic and planetary expertise of the two Investigators and involving both graduate and undergraduate students in international collaboration and the process of scientific inquiry. Both investigators have a long history of public outreach. The University of Tennessee will support a local middle school teacher to construct a series of physically contained, hand-on exercises (and associated web materials) that explore tsunamis and extraterrestrial impacts as geologic phenomena that shape our world. These exercises will be provided to a number of regional schools, and funding will also support undergraduate and graduate ?student ambassadors? to visit up to ten local middle schools to work with students and teachers in implementing these exercises, thereby enhancing secondary science education in eastern Tennessee NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Innovation and discovery involve individuals working successfully together in teams. It is critical for the Science of Science and Innovation Policy to understand how the cognition of individuals, the direct source of novel ideas and critical decision making, is impacted by social teamwork variables. Prior research has typically studied social teamwork variables in isolation or individual cognition variables in isolation. To know how to intervene to increase engineering and scientific output, the relationships between the two must be known, or else we might improve one at the cost of hurting the other, which likely would have no net improvement in final scientific or engineering productivity. The current project examines a very large quantity of video data collected from a recent highly successful case of science and engineering, the Mars Exploration Rover, which both wildly exceeded engineering requirements for the mission and produced many important scientific discoveries. Yet, not all days of the mission were equally successful. From this video record, the project traces the path from the structure of different subgroups (such as having formal roles and diversity of knowledge in the subgroups) to the occurrence of different social processes (such as task conflict, breadth of participation, communication norms, and shared mental models) to the occurrence of different cognitive processes (such as analogy, information search, and evaluation) and finally to outcomes (such as new methods for rover control and new hypotheses regarding the nature of Mars).Another critical factor for Science of Science and Innovation Policy is to examine both divergent thinking and convergent thinking. Innovation rarely happens unless new ideas are considered. But progress will not happen unless the best ideas among the proposed set are ultimately selected. To know how to best intervene to improve discovery and innovation, progress must be made on finding out when to intervene, which likely depends upon whether divergent or convergent thinking is currently required. A number of prior inconsistent research results likely resulted from a failure to separately consider divergent and convergent thinking. The current project examines both elements to build a much more complete model of how cognitive and social variables come together to produce new and successful engineering innovations and scientific discoveries. Broader Impacts: The US is facing serious challenges in the fields of science and technology. Innovation must be harnessed to generate new products, create employment opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. It is vital that the flourishing of science and engineering teams be examined with the same rigor as other important human endeavors. This project also has implications for science and engineering education: as ways of composing, structuring, and instructing teams are examined, suggestions for pedagogy will be formulated based on empirical findings NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Student Travel Support for the 2008 North American Power Symposium, held at Calgary, Canada, September 28, 2008 ? September 30, 2008.This proposal requests funding to subsidize the travel expenses incurred by students attending the 40th Annual North American Power Symposium to be held at Calgary, Canada from September 28 to September 30, 2008. It is anticipated that this subsidy will positively impact the extent of student participation at the conference. The North American Power Symposium (NAPS) is a non-profit event that is aimed primarily at student participation. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of the papers are presented by students. At the 2008 NAPS, the organizers are taking several other steps to foster and encourage student participation. This includes arrangement for free accommodation of registered students. Additional measures are being taken to encourage women and minorities to participate.Intellectual Merit: NAPS is unique in its focus on students preparing and presenting technical papers. This conference provides a unique opportunity for NSF to interact with and promote interaction among students, academia and power industry to promote and discuss NSF?s vision of technical challenges in power and energy, and complex systems, sensing, communication and control as well as its economic, educational and sociological impact. NAPS is also venue to an exciting student paper competition for identifying and fostering high quality research performed by students.Broader Impact: NAPS conferences have a history of giving students their first opportunity at research presentations. Further, NAPS encourages discussion of systematic integration of research and teaching. Based on recent history of NAPS conferences the student program has been able to attract 20% minorities and women NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER August 14, 2008ABSTRACTProposal: 0848474Title: Project Science: A Program in Education and Training in Management of Big Science ProjectsInstitution: California Institute of TechnologyNSF Program: Elementary Particle Accelerator User GroupsPrincipal Investigator: Sanders, Gary H.Efficient management of large science facilities requires experience and skills not usually found in the repertoire of research scientists. This proposal addresses the planning and definition of educational programs for early-career scientists (undergraduate students through postdoctoral fellows), to practicing mid-career researchers as they approach leadership roles in project science settings or as they adapt to collaborating in existing projects.Building upon the prior activity  Project Science: A Program in Education and Training in Management of Big Science Projects, the PI  proposes to extend this research and workshop program for up to two years while developing a follow-on proposal for a broader activity combining these lessons learned workshops in the management of big science projects, and the synthesis of the case studies into new insights and practices in this field with a new activity that reaches out to the involved communities through a monthly electronic newsletter, community based web presence and electronic publishing.Marvin GoldbergProgram OfficerMPS/PHY/EPP NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The proposed research is designed to enhance science-related education for at-risk students and others with diverse learning needs. Recent research has demonstrated that deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students come into the STEM classroom with less information than hearing peers and also learn less. Results consistently have shown that neither students' reading levels nor communication skills are sufficient to explain this situation. The proposed project will focus on the effects on learning of DHH students' comprehension monitoring skills and their relatively lesser content knowledge and infrequent use of integrative learning strategies. Experiments involve participants' reading or seeing presentations and then answering questions, summarizing content, and/or identifying other features of the presented information prior to learning assessments. With one exception, content is presented in signed, spoken, or written form. Students will make judgments about the expected accuracy of their responses; these and other methods will be used to assess their awareness of ongoing comprehension in addition to learning per se. It is expected that metacognitive accuracy will vary as a function of factors such as method of presentation, mode of communication, the nature of the material, and possibly several demographic variables. Of particular interest are measures of learning, ongoing comprehension monitoring, and the ways in which these influence each other. The research is expected to refute claims that deaf students' learning challenges are specific to printed materials or poor communication skills NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER VERSATILE BIOSENSING PLATFORM FOR MONITORING BONE MARKERS FOR SPACE MEDICINE   The space environment - including microgravity - is known to induce metabolic changes that could have a negative effect on astronaut health and performance especially during NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SRI International (SRI), Girls Incorporated of Alameda County (GIAC), and TERC are collaborating to create and implement Girls InnovaTE3: Girls Innovating with Technology as Entrepreneurial Environmental Engineers. InnovaTE3, a Strategies project in NSF's ITEST program, is an out-of-school youth-centered curriculum for 8th through 11th grade girls. Within this context, InnovaTE3 will investigate the strategy of integrating innovation practices with interest-driven science learning for girls, evaluating the potential of the strategy to accomplish five goals: (1) developing and applying girls understanding of core concepts in Earth systems science content to an engineering design challenge, (2) developing girls interest and confidence in pursuing additional STEM content knowledge, (3) increasing girls? fluency in the innovation process and preparedness for the engineering workforce, (4) enhancing girls knowledge of a variety of STEM careers and interest in pursuing a specific STEM career, and (5) building staff capacity in after-school sites to engage girls in integrating innovation with science content NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This is a SGER proposal for the field testing of a promising formative assessment-based mathematics intervention in the civilian sector. The original intervention, from which the civilian intervention will be co-developed, focuses on building mathematics knowledge and reasoning skills in Navy recruits - these are basic skills necessary to meet Navy technical and job demand requirements. This SGER supports the co-development of the civilian sector intervention. The skills the Navy needs in basic mathematics are the same skills necessary to meet basic technical job requirements in the civilian sector - essentially pre-algebra and algebra skills. The project will use CRESST's POWERSOURCE middle school mathematics intervention for this study. The majority of Navy recruits deficient in mathematics are from under represented communities - these are the same communities that are a disadvantage in the civilian workforce because of their lack of basic mathematics skills. The project will produce materials appropriate for use in vocational schools, 2 year colleges, and for remedial mathematics in 4 year institutions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Non-native plant species are an ever-present part of forests today and often negatively influences their adopted natural habitat by reducing survival of native plant and animal species. The present study will investigate the impact of Amur honeysuckle, an invasive non-native shrub, on the forests of Southwestern Ohio. The research will focus on nutrient cycling within this ecosystem by examining the relationship between organic inputs (e.g., fallen leaves), soil nutrients, and soil microbial diversity and composition (bacteria and fungi).  These parameters strongly influence how fast nutrients are cycled through an ecosystem and may be an important predictor of what species will be most successful in an area.  The study will elucidate differences between forested sites with and without honeysuckle and examine the potential for and time-scale of recovery of below-ground resources through honeysuckle removal experiments.The results of this research will provide new insights that may enhance forest restoration efforts. By integrating research and education the project will enhance undergraduate education through hands on research experiences and encourage broader participation by underrepresented groups in the sciences. To achieve these goals the project will, create summer research positions for college students from underrepresented groups, develop an exciting inquiry based laboratory that will introduce students to forest ecology through engaging them in actual field research, and  conduct short-term summer classes for K-12 students from local public schools NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0824890XuThis proposal seeks funding to purchase a new X-ray diffraction (XRD) instrument. The current 20 year old instrument has developed electrical problems and suffers from unreliable background stability. The manufacturer of the current instrument has since gone out of business and no support options are available. The requested upgrade will be capable of general powder X-ray diffraction, micro-diffraction, and wide angle X-ray scattering. Also proposed is a 2-D image plate detector system. XRD is a common technique for studying Earth and extraterrestrial materials. The research team will put the requested instrument into service to 1) better understand mineralogical signals indicative of supporting life found in Earth and planetary samples, 2) better understand rock-water interactions through mineral signatures, 3) determine biosignatures in Earth and planetary rocks, 4) understand the role of microbes in mediating redox reactions in Fe-bearing clays and Fe-oxides in addition to U(IV) mineral formation and redox processes in the subsurface, and 5) quantitatively survey clay, carbonate and feldspar/quartz mineralology in glacial tills, eolian sediments, and lacustrine deposits in order to reconstruct paleoclimatic changes. The new instrument will be housed in current X-ray Diffraction Laboratory at UWM. Current infrastructure (cooling water, AC, power, distilled water, etc) is in place to support the acquisition. A 50%-time XRD lab manager will support operation and is supervised by the PI. The lab manager will train new users, provide tech support, maintain the XRD and associated instruments, develop techniques and keep general records. A first-come, first-serve web-based sign up system is in place for the current instrument and will continue to be used. Users pay an hourly fee. The fees support 25% of the FTE lab manager and maintenance costs. The old instrument will be kept for training purposes NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The University of Rhode Island (URI), Rhode Island College (RIC), Johnston Public Schools and the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) are Core Partners in a comprehensive, statewide effort to improve the quality of science teaching and learning at all secondary schools.  The Education Alliance at Brown University, which will evaluate the project, is a supporting partner together with the Community College of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation and the Concord Consortium. Rhode Island Technology Enhanced Science (RITES) is based upon structural reform initiated with the support of the Governor. An action plan developed by a PK-16 council resulted in an investment of $15 million to establish a permanent STEM Center that features two new tenure track positions and will provide support to all schools.  The comprehensive statewide STEM education reform also has support from all levels of government and academia and RITES represents a valuable experiment in organization and structure within that effort.  The RITES project will, in five years of NSF funding, transform the quality of science teaching and learning at all secondary schools, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of students who are proficient in science and pursue careers in Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM).  The heart of the project is the seamless integration of all segments of the Rhode Island educational community (i.e., teachers and school systems, higher education science departments and schools of education, the various state offices that monitor and support STEM education and the private sector). RITES will impact all 686 middle school and high school teachers and all of their 83,339 students with excellent, challenging, computer-based, standards-aligned, science materials.  Pairs of high schools and feeder middle schools will join the Partnership together by developing a unified, comprehensive, middle and high school science action plan that will integrate RITES resources, for professional development of teachers and materials for students, with school needs and ongoing school reform.  Schools that participate in the project will be expected to have the active engagement of the school leadership and at least 75% of the science teachers.  Teachers will attend short courses not only to deepen their content knowledge and pedagogy but also to learn how to customize the newly designed curricular materials for their own classrooms. The comprehensive evaluation plan will include annual reviews of the New England Common Assessments Program (NECAP) science assessment,which will be administered for the first time in Spring 2008.  Results will be disaggregated by race, gender and disabilities and income. Specific benchmarks for student achievement, teacher professional development and workforce diversity will be used to track progress NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER INCORPORATING ION-NEUTRAL INTERACTIONS INTO 3D MULTI-FLUID SIMULATIONS: UNDERSTANDING ENCELADUS'' PLUME THROUGH OBSERVATION AND SIMULATION Instruments on the Cassini spacecraft discovered a plume of water-ice particles / vapor / and dust grains jetting ou NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Engineering - Other (59)This project is supporting a workshop to identify specific activities that the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) should undertake or expand in order to support transformational engineering faculty development for instructional excellence. The workshop is bringing together varied stakeholders in engineering education to identify, analyze, and summarize existing knowledge and practices that contribute to effective engineering faculty development for instructional excellence focusing on what ASEE currently does and should be doing. The output of the workshop will be a report and a set of consensus recommendations. This is the beginning of a larger process that will then use the report as a framework for new and expanded ASEE initiatives to support and encourage instructional excellence in the nation's engineering education programs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0832026 A Mathematics Teacher Leadership Center (Math TLC) is proposed by the University of Northern Colorado and its Core Partners, the University of Wyoming, Greeley School District #6 (CO), Morgan County School District (CO), Poudre County School District (CO), Laramie County School District 1 (WY), and Carbon County School District 1 (WY).Math TLC is an integrated partnership to improve mathematics in middle, secondary and post secondary education in the north Rocky Mountains region.  Key to this Teacher Institute project is working with teachers and districts to retain new and continuing teachers in the field and develop leadership capacity.  The Partners will develop and implement a Master's degree in Secondary Mathematics, and a Teacher Leadership Program in mathematics for teachers, grades 4-12.  Research is to be carried out on the impact of both these programs on student achievement.The Master's program (32 credit hours) will support 4 cohorts of 15-18 teachers per year and the Teacher Leadership program (24 credit hours) will support 3 cohorts of 10-12 teachers per year, over the five year project.  The courses will be a combination of face- to-face and on-line delivery.  More than 95,000 students from grades 4 through 12 are potentially impacted over the life of the project: 23,700 directly by teacher enrolled in the master's program and 71, 000 students of teachers who will work with Teacher Leaders. An intensive recruitment program is planned to attract teachers from Native American school districts in Colorado (Southern Ute Indian Reservation and Ute Mountain Indian Reservation) and Wyoming (the Wind River Reservation).The research program will study the impact of professional development (PD) on teachers' mathematical understanding, pedagogical content knowledge and cultural competencies for teaching diverse students in Colorado and Wyoming.  The study will track teacher change and its effect on student achievement, grades 6-12, and will advance knowledge of teacher leadership development through a quantitative design experiment of the leadership model proposed by the project. The transformative concept in Math TLC is the development of the online master's degree shared jointly by the Universities of Northern Colorado and Wyoming in combination with a leadership program.  Success will require substantive institutional affiliation and will transform PD for isolated rural teachers by providing significant mathematics content integrated with culturally informed pedagogical methods, by creating master teachers and teacher-leaders that have the expertise to intellectually engage underserved groups.The comprehensive dissemination plan includes a web portal for the online distribution of research and implementation outcomes, publications of findings in peer reviewed journals and presentations at regional and national meetings. The Partnership will actively work in the future to broaden the collaborative to include additional school and university partners.The benefits to society are improved mathematics teaching and learning in socio-economically, culturally, and ethnically diverse classrooms NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Institution:  Social Science Research CouncilPrincipal Investigator:  Adrian DeWindTitle:  Capacity Building for International Social Science ResearchWith NSF support, the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) will broaden participation and enhance the capacity of social scientists to contribute to international research, particularly in countries with emerging and transitional economies.  SSRC will organize a meeting to build on earlier international consultations of the SSRC, the International Social Science Council and its Committee on Developing and Transition Economies that have linked social scientists and national funding agencies in advancing the social sciences internationally.  The meeting will advance previous efforts by producing a report that will:o Identify topics for international researcho Clarify approaches to capacity building;o Map successful programs; o Design programs and mobilize resources.Intellectual MeritCapacity building for international social science is an important topic that addresses a critical issue in social science research.  Issues related to comparative and integrated modes of international social science research are addressed.  Broader ImpactsThe proposed activity involves collaborations with emerging and transitional economies to develop international research in social science.  Efforts to build capacity globally with regard to international research are especially needed in today's complex society NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER TECHNICAL: This is an SGER project focused on energy/entropy transport in nanostructured conductors. PI plans to investigate electronic transmission through constrictions, under ballistic conditions and with an applied non-homogeneous magnetic field, of charge carriers that have orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Heat removed at contacts that can potentially be used for cooling/power generation, would be evaluated by measuring the Seebeck coefficient. The project is inspired by the thermodynamic process of adiabatic demagnetization that is the basis of a successful cooling technology and the process that PI aims to demonstrate can be denominated 'adiabatic demagnetization in a wire'. The project is experimental. The nanostructures are made of bismuth, antimony, and their alloys because these semimetals exhibit low intrinsic dissipation. To fabricate the samples, PI will employ a high pressure, high-temperature injection technique that uses nanochannel dielectrics as a template structure to fabricate dense and massive composites consisting of arrays or networks of bismuth constrictions with controllable diameters in the range of 100 nm to 1 um. These materials are organized in devices, featuring a source of inhomogeneous field, which will also be fabricated. Measurements of the energy/entropy transport will be performed in these devices. Estimates show great prospects. PI's theoretical model of energy/entropy transport, that considers both phonon and electron mean-free-paths, show that transfer peaks for nanostructure characteristic sizes of around 500 nm. The estimated efficiency is close to the Carnot efficiency at low temperatures (4 kelvin). By using materials that have extraordinarily long electronic mean free paths (namely bismuth) shaped into nanosize structures of characteristic sizes smaller than the mean free path the project explores, in solid state materials, electronic phenomena traditionally observed in vacuum electronics. The project also aims to impact the field of magnetism in nanostructures, that is closely related to the field of spintronics because the mechanisms of transfer of magnetic polarization will be explored. NON-TECHNICAL: The research impacts the field of solid-state thermal-to-electric conversion, thermoelectrics and thermoionics. These processes involve neither mechanical parts that wear down nor fluorocarbons that damage the environment and solid state coolers and generators can be miniaturized for use in miniature sensors and actuators. This project includes a strong educational component, emphasizing the participation of undergraduate students in the research program. Howard University, graduates more African-American students than any other college in the nation. Howard is noted for excellence in undergraduate and graduate education. The research program will offer both undergraduate and graduate students opportunities to participate in a diverse range of scientific activities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0843798MusteThe PI proposes to better understand and refine river discharge estimates using improved measures of rating curves. Traditional river discharge estimates are conducted at times when flow is relatively normal and steady, allowing safe and convenient measurement. These measurements serve as the basis for calculating rating curves. The curves, in turn, are used to estimate flow and discharge during flood events ? possibly leading to significant uncertainty due to hysteresis. Understanding the discharge-flow hysteresis relationship requires measurements during high flow events. The 2008 Midwestern flood offers a unique opportunity to couple flow and discharge measurements in order to better understand and model rating curve hysteresis during extreme events. With the goal of coupling river stage and discharge, measurements will be made in a non-contact manner developed at IIHR-Hydroscience & Engineering which uses Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV). This technique was initiated on June 10, 2008. Funds are requested to 1) finalize the on-going measurements; 2) perform topographic and bathymetric surveys; 3) evaluate deployed instruments by conducting baseline flow measurements; 4) analyze data and report findings; and 5) produce conceptual process models and define future research needs. The unique aspect of the proposed research is the use of non-intrusive measurement techniques in a natural extreme event provided by the 2008 Midwestern flood. The series of measurements will allow the PI to assess the technique and its ability to provide improved rating curve estimates under rare unsteady flow situations in natural channels. The expectation is that LSPIV will provide a simple, compact, cost- and effort-effective package for providing these critical measurements. Unsteady flows will be investigated in detail and conceptual frameworks will be developed in order to determine what ancillary data are needed to answer discharge hypotheses. The transformative, exploratory nature of this project will provide field testing for technical aspects of the LSPIV technique to include specular reflection for free-surface tracing, optimal velocity distribution laws in the water column testing as a function of stream characteristics, flood wave raising and falling data capture, and uncertainty analysis. Rating curves are the basis of stream stage measurements, yet their uncertainty during high-flow events obviates the ability to fully understand unsteady fluvial processes. River processes hypotheses regarding extreme and unusual flow regimes can be tested and the results of this study will enable river stage and discharge estimation in regions without gauging stations. Integrated hydrologic-geomorphic-biological studies will be possible through a better understanding of key temporal and spatial processes in flood propagation. Uncertainty in rating curves calculated during stable river flow regimes will hinder flood stage forecasting whereas this project will provide data useable by national mission agencies for more accurate flood estimates. With billions of dollars lost each year, more accurate flood data are timely and of broad interest NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports a symposium to advance the science of biogeochemical cycles.  It will bring together ~70 individuals, including a diverse group of students with young and more established scientists, to share recent research results and perspectives in biogeochemistry.  The symposium will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America (Albuquerque, New Mexico, August, 2009), which will allow many other environmental scientists and students to participate.  The symposium, and plans for an open access publication and online presentations to disseminate the results, will promote the interdisciplinary nature of biochemistry.  Four scientific themes provide an exciting conceptual organization: the evolution of biogeochemical cycles throughout earth history; biogeochemical cycles as couplers of atmosphere, geosphere and biosphere; the significance of humans as drivers of biogeochemical cycles; and the dynamic feedbacks between global biogeochemical cycles and climate change.  The symposium will explore recent scientific advances in each of these areas, and illustrate how biogeochemical cycles serve as feedback mechanisms linking climate change with coupled human-natural systems.  Invited speakers and other contributing participants include a diverse representation of aquatic, marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric expertise NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The six micro-satellite Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) was launched on April 14, 2006 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. All satellites and payloads are functioning well, and the program began distributing all data to all interested parties three months after launch in late July 2006. The program was executed within budget and schedule and the high-quality data are already starting to significantly affect atmospheric and ionospheric science and operational weather forecasting. Following several months of testing, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) commenced operational use of the COSMIC data on December 13, 2006. Several operational centers, including the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UK Met Office), Météo-France, and the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) plan to begin operational assimilation of COSMIC data in early 2007. As of January 2007, there are 400 registered users of the data, representing major U.S. and international universities, leading operational weather centers, research laboratories, and several private companies. The status of the spacecraft and data processing center can be found at the COSMIC web site: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/ The COSMIC satellites are designed to last for at least five years. While the satellites are expected to operate through 2011, the U.S. component of this joint Taiwan-U.S. program is only funded until November 2007. The operation of the remote tracking stations (RTS) is funded only through April 2008, per a service agreement with a private company, Universal Space Network (USN). This proposal seeks additional funding from the NSF and other participating U.S. agencies to continue the program to cover the entire 5-year expected lifetime of the satellite constellation, through September 30, 2011. While Taiwan will continue to operate the constellation, the US contribution is critical to ensure continued delivery of the data and data products. The main tasks to be performed with US funding are: (i) operation of the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) for data processing, quality control, and dissemination, (ii) continued development and improvement of processing algorithms, (iii) assumption of 50% of the cost for the operation of the COSMIC RTS for near-real time data collection, (iv) continued improvement and maintenance of Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) science payload firmware and software, and (v) operation of the COSMIC Project Office to support the national and international science community. Intellectual Merit: This project has extremely high intellectual merit in that it will make use of innovative GPS RO techniques to provide global, continuous, and all-weather observations of the atmosphere for research and operations. COSMIC delivers two major advancements in GPS RO science: (i) the design and implementation of an advanced  open-loop  tracking technique for space-based sensing of the atmospheric boundary layer and (ii) the design and operation of first constellation that produces real-time RO soundings with uniform global coverage to support atmospheric research and operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), climate monitoring and research, and space-weather forecasting. Broader Impacts: With the availability of ~2,500 soundings globally per day, COSMIC will have a broad and far-reaching impact for the operational and research atmospheric science communities. COSMIC will provide valuable data in traditional data sparse regions of the world, including polar and oceanic regions, for weather and climate studies. The fact that the COSMIC data are of high precision, high accuracy, and high vertical resolution, are not affected by clouds and precipitation, and require no inter-satellite cross-calibration, makes COSMIC ideally suited for climate research. COSMIC also provides much-needed ionospheric observations for analysis and forecasting of space weather, and other ionospheric research. The COSMIC data and the processing software will be made freely available to the broad university and user community. The project also has a significant educational component, as it will involve graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows through collaboration with universities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Engineering - Other (59)The project addresses an important national need: evaluating effectiveness of engineering education innovations and research. The goal is to build an annotated inventory of evaluation tools for determining the effectiveness of projects targeted at improving engineering education and student retention along the engineering pipeline. An experienced team of engineering education, assessment and evaluation professionals will conduct an extensive search for existing evaluation tools and document their usefulness for the engineering education research and development community. Recognized national experts in engineering education and evaluation will review and contribute to the evaluation of tools and the resulting inventory. Products of this work include: (1) a catalog of evaluation tools characterized by outcomes addressed, instrument stage of development, and instrument usability, (2) a prioritized list of evaluation tool gaps needing to be addressed to support engineering course, curriculum, and laboratory improvement, (3) a journal publication presenting the methodology and results of the evaluation tools inventory, (4) a national workshop to refine and disseminate results and to promote needed evaluation tools development, and (5) a strategy for broad dissemination of findings and evaluation tools NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER SHORT- AND LONG-TERM VARIATIONS OF ENERGETIC HEAVY ION DISTRIBUTIONS OBSERVED IN THE SATURNIAN MAGNETOSPHERE  We study variation of energetic (>55 keV/e) / heavy / singly-charged atomic and molecular ions (EHI) in the Saturnian magnetosphere with the Cass NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This research group proposes that blind thrust faults in the core of growing anticlines exhibit variable slip at 10,000 to 100,000 year time scales and that this slip is rooted in crustal-scale processes of stress transfer among faults responding to climatically-driven processes at the Earth?s surface. Studies along the mountain front of the northern Apennines, Italy will delineate the slip history of two related, but physically disconnected faults at a approximately 20,000 year resolution over a five million year Pliocene - Recent time span. Because this record of fault slip coincides with the well-known large amplitude oscillations in global climate that contribute to the filling and deformation of the Po foreland, the team further hypothesizes that the 100,000 year, and potentially 40,000 year climatic cycles will be reflected in observed slip rates as faults are differentially lubricated by changing ground water conditions, sea-level and structural emergence, and differentially loading by the redistribution of sediment at the surface. The project will employ cyclostraigraphy of anhysteretic remanent magnetization calibrated to accurate models of Earth's orbital motions, which constitutes a high-resolution metronome with a precision, accuracy and continuity that outperforms modern radioisotope geochronology, magnetostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy and transcends the problems of resolution and length of record that have limited GPS and paleoseismic approaches. Fault slip unsteadiness with a periodicity in line with known climatic cycles at 40,000-100,000 year time spans will prove the hypothesis.Knowledge of fault slip rate variation on a fault with 10,000-100,000 year resolution has important geodynamic, and seismic hazard implications particularly for the case of blind thrust faults that can generate significant earthquakes, such as the 2008 Los Angeles basin earthquakes. Similar kinds of earthquakes resulting from blind thrust faults are well documented for the northern Apennine (Italy) mountain front, home to 4 million residents where deformation rates and seismic hazards remain poorly defined. Here spatial and temporal gaps in earthquake activity are considered as places where damaging earthquakes do not or will not occur. This research suggests that such gaps are simply the result of fault slip unsteadiness and aims to determine a cause for the unsteadiness by studying the geologic record NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit: Northeastern University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, and the University of Wyoming will partner in a research study designed to investigate the hypothesis that women's participation in formal undergraduate engineering programs that provide work experiences while enrolled (e.g., cooperative education or internships), leads to enhanced self-efficacy and an increased likelihood of retention through graduation. Although all four schools offer cooperative education or internship programs, Northeastern University and Rochester Institute of Technology require them. Using a variety of survey research tools, this project seeks to isolate those factors and experiences that contribute most to the development of positive self-efficacy beliefs and, ultimately, to the retention of women in undergraduate engineering programs. The role of self-efficacy will be examined and compared to other factors in order to develop a model that demonstrates how demographic variables, work experiences, contextual supports, and three dimensions of self-efficacy (work, academic, and career) interact to predict retention. Self-efficacy theory has been used to explain the career development of women, especially in male-dominated careers such as engineering. Self-efficacy beliefs are considered the primary cognitive determinants of behavior, including whether a behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long behavior will be sustained in the face of obstacles. This research will expand the existing knowledge base about the role of work experiences and self-efficacy for women in undergraduate engineering programs by addressing the following hypotheses: - Self-efficacy is the principal predictor of retention of women in undergraduate engineering programs.- Cooperative education and internships, as formal work experience features of undergraduate programs, constitute a critical predictor of women?s retention directly and indirectly through their impact on self-efficacy. - Contextual support variables affect work, career, and academic self-efficacy as well as retention both directly and indirectly through self-efficacy. - Demographic variables have an independent effect on retention but also interact with contextual variables and with self-efficacy to indirectly affect retention. Data will be collected using a survey instrument featuring a work self-efficacy inventory.  Each school will gather accurate retention figures by tracking individual student files instead of institutional methods that tend to use a  black box  approach of comparing the number of students entering in with the number of students graduating. The data will be analyzed using regression and path analyses to determine how the variables interact to predict retention. Broader Impacts: This study will have wide-ranging implications for undergraduate engineering programs. The resulting model will enable university administrators to discriminate among a variety of program supports, such as work experience and advising programs, and their relationship to retention. Many engineering colleges already offer cooperative education and internship programs but have little data about the impact of these programs or how to leverage them. This research provides a unique way to connect gender and self-efficacy theory to undergraduate engineering programs while addressing the critical student outcomes of efficacy (especially work self-efficacy) and degree attainment NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER FIRST PRINCIPLES SIMULATIONS OF HYDROGEN-HELIUM MIXTURES IN THE INTERIORS OF GIANT PLANETS   During the second year of this grant the hydrogen-helium calculations for planetary interiors were again the main research area of the PI / Burkhard Militzer NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit     Filamentous fungi are the primary degraders of plant cellulosic material in the environment.  Different species of filamentous fungi are associated with the roots of almost all plant species in a symbiotic relationship that allows plants to gain micronutrients from soil.  In addition, other species are disease causing agents in plants, or cause important human diseases.  All of these filamentous fungi, both beneficial and pathogenic species, grow by tip extension, branching and hyphal fusion to form a hyphal network.  The formation of the hyphal network is believed to be essential for transfer of nutrients throughout ecosystems by root associated and saprophytic fungi and for colony establishment and exploitation of resources in pathogenic fungi.  Although tip growth and branching have been extensively studied in filamentous fungi, little is known about the mechanism of hyphal fusion or the function of the hyphal network.  Live cell imaging and genetic analysis of hyphal fusion in the model filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa have revealed that the process of hyphal fusion is a complex and carefully regulated biological process.  A large number of components essential for hyphal fusion have been identified in N. crassa, including components of signal transduction pathways, polarization components, filamentous fungal specific proteins and transmembrane proteins.  Hyphal fusion mutants show developmental defects, in addition to slower growth rates and/or lag phase to reach maximal growth rate.  These observations indicate that the formation of an interconnected network in filamentous fungi is essential for both exploitation of an environmental niche and for developmental processes.  The objectives of this research are to dissect the process of germling/hyphal fusion using a combination of live cell imaging, genetic analysis and biochemical tools to elucidate the mechanisms of self-signaling, polarization and membrane merger with the ultimate goal of understanding the role of hyphal networks in ecosystems, symbiosis and pathogenesis. Broader Impact:Hyphal fusion in filamentous fungi is comparable to cell fusion events between genetically identical cells in other organisms, such as cell-cell fusion resulting in syncytia, such as myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation, trophoblast fusion during placental development and between osteoclasts during bone formation. Thus, studying cell-cell fusion in N. crassa provides a useful model for understanding molecular mechanisms of cell fusion events in more complex eukaryotic species.  This project provides excellent training projects for undergraduate, graduate students and post-doctoral associates.  A number of undergraduate California Opportunity Scholars have been recruited to this project; these students come from disadvantaged backgrounds and low performing schools in the Bay Area NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 8TH PACIFIC RIM CONFERENCE ON CERAMIC AND GLASS TECHNOLOGY (PACRIM 8)   The forthcoming Pacific Rim Conference on Ceramic and Glass Technology in Vancouver is the eighth in a series of international conferences that provide a forum for the presentations NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER HEALTH MONITORING OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES   A collaborative relationship between NASA DFRC and the Department of Aerospace Engineering.  University of Michigan is proposed to leverage the University  s internationally recognized advanced capabilities in NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER If physical models are to achieve a realistic description of transport, they need to incorporate the breadth and richness of the multi-scale heterogeneity present in natural landscapes, but currently they fail to do so.  We will develop the mathematical tools needed for this task by adapting and extending fractional calculus to the modeling of sediment motion.  Fractional calculus allows us to write differential equations of particle fluxes that incorporate, simply and directly, broad-tailed probability distributions of grain size, single particle hops and storage times on the bed.  It does so by providing differential operators of fractional order, which means that changes in model variables are calculated regionally or non-locally, rather than at a point in space or time as in classical calculus.  It is this non-locality that allows a concise treatment of the multi-scale, spatiotemporal heterogeneities of particle sizes, velocities, and transport distances seen in natural rivers and hillslopes.  We will develop the analytical treatments and numerical methods necessary to build and solve generalized geomorphic transport laws towards improved predictions and modeling of landscape dynamics.

Sediment transport is a key element of change in the natural environment, and one whose importance is increasing under the pressure of human population growth, land use and climate change. This project has the potential to gain new insights into the mechanisms of sediment transport, that will enable better predictions of the results of river flooding and aid in disaster management NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CAREER: Integrating Research, Education, and Heterogeneity into Groundwater Models of Glaciated Urban Areas                     Lawrence D. Lemke, Wayne State University In the face of growing U.S. population in the 21st century, reliable numerical flow and transport models are essential tools for managing groundwater resources in expanding urbanized areas. The development of such models is particularly challenging in glaciated regions where depositional complexities make it difficult to predict the detailed three dimensional distributions of hydrostratigraphic units that control local scale groundwater flow and contaminant transport. This research project will apply alternative methods to model the spatial variability of physical attributes and quantify uncertainty in predicted groundwater flow and solute transport within an urban glacial aquifer system.  Allostratigraphic correlation methods will be used to identify bounding surfaces and define the gross hydrostratigraphic architecture. Subsequently, geostatistical methods will be used to model smaller scale variability within the allostratigraphic correlation units.  It is postulated that such hybrid models of aquifer variability will define a wider range of uncertainty in groundwater flow and contaminant transport predictions than that established by varying aquifer parameters or boundary conditions within a single, most-likely deterministic aquifer model.  Uncertainty associated with alternative deterministic and stochastic conceptual models will also be assessed.  The results of this research are expected to demonstrate that predictive uncertainty cannot be adequately quantified using a single deterministic geologic model. As a further outcome of the research activities, it is expected that hybrid deterministic and stochastic models will enjoy more frequent application and, as a consequence, our ability to predict and quantify uncertainties in the movement of contaminants through highly heterogeneous aquifer systems will improve. The research will be conducted at Wayne State University, a prominent urban research institution serving 33,000 students, located in a glaciated region with an expanding metropolitan area and a long history of industrial activity. The accompanying Education Plan will strengthen the Environmental Science Program at Wayne State while training a new generation of students (including underrepresented minorities) with the critical skills needed to build hybrid numerical models of heterogeneous aquifer systems. Because Wayne State?s undergraduate student body consists of 37% minority students (33% African-American), this project will impact a diverse cross-section of students. A combination of field trips, peer mentoring, and learning communities will be used to attract and retain underrepresented minority students to the Geology and Environmental Science Programs. In addition, approximately 1,000 general education students and 20 to 30 Geology and Environmental Science majors will be exposed to problem-based learning activities associated with the proposed research each year. By helping to bridge the gap of minority under-representation in science, this project will help meet the growing U.S. demand for science and engineering graduates NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Unlike current telecommunications based on electrical or optical signals, the biological communications technology uses chemical signals as carriers of information. This technology exhibits various distinct features such as biocompatibility and energy-efficiency, potentially enabling new Bio-ICT (Information and Communications Technology) applications that are not likely achieved by current silicon-based technology. For example, molecular communication can be applied to biocompatible information systems in which implanted biological devices chemically interact with tissues and organs in the human body. It is also applicable to unconventional information systems in which biological cells chemically coordinate to grow into a three dimensional structure that functions as information processing and storage systems.In this project, the investigator is exploring biological cells and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms. The specific objectives in this project are fourfold; (1) design and engineering of system components - designing, engineering and characterizing necessary building blocks of molecular communication systems (e.g., repeaters and switches), (2) system integration - developing a microplatform that can integrate independent components into a working system, (3) application designs - demonstrating novel applications using an integrated molecular communication system, and (4) establishment of information theory - addressing the theoretical basis such as channel capacity and coding mechanisms of molecular communication. The project is expected to provide new insights and findings into science and engineering. It examines how information is communicated, processed and stored in biological systems from a communication and engineering view point, which may help enhance current engineering principles as well as advance bio-inspired information technology. It is also expected to address a number of unanswered questions on design principles of biological systems NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Collaborative Research: Computational Models for Evaluating Long TermCO2 Storage in Saline AquifersThe key goal of this project is to produce a prototypicalcomputational system to accurately predict the fate of injected CO2in conditions governed by multiphase flow, rock mechanics,multicomponent transport, thermodynamic phase behavior, chemicalreactions within both the fluid and the rock, and the coupling of allthese phenomena over multiple time and spatial scales.To tackle this grand challenge effort, a multidisciplinary researchteam has been assembled of senior researchers M. F. Wheeler,T. Arbogast, and M. Delshad of the Center for Subsurface Modelingand I. Duncan from the Bureau of Economic Geology  at TheUniversity of Texas at Austin, as well as M. Parashar ofthe Applied Software Systems Laboratory at Rutgers University. Thisgroup has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computationalscience that includes multiscale and multiphysics algorithms, solvers,uncertainty, and optimization (2) computer sciencethat includes dynamic adaptivity, model/code couplings, and datamanagement and transport (3) compositional modeling andCO2 injection processes and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.In each of the third and fourth years of the project, we willhost a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high schoolstudents, and undergraduate students with an interest in high schoolteaching. We will provide training in the use of a sophisticated groundwatersimulator, to be used as a tool to engage and pique the interest ofhigh schoolers, perhaps leading some to careers in mathematics, thesciences, and interdisciplinary work.  In addition, two postdoctoralstudents and roughly two graduate students will be supportedthroughout the project.Geologic sequestration is a proven means of permanent CO2 greenhouse gasstorage, but it is difficult to design and manage such efforts.  Predictivecomputational simulation may be the only means to account for the lack ofcomplete characterization of the subsurface environment, the multiple scales ofthe various interacting processes, the large areal extent of saline aquifers,and the need for long time predictions.  This proposal will investigate highfidelity multiscale and multiphysics algorithms necessary for simulation ofmultiphase flow and transport coupled with geochemical reactions and relatedmineralogy, and geomechanical deformation in porous media to predict changes inrock properties during sequestration.  The work will result in a prototypicalcomputational framework with advanced numerical algorithms and underlyingtechnology for research in CO2 applications, which has been validated andverified against field-scale experimental tests.  The multidisciplinaryresearch team has expertise in (1) applied mathematics and computationalscience, (2) computer science and engineering, (3) compositional modeling andCO2 injection processes, and (4) CO2 demonstration sites.In each of the third and fourth years of the project, we willhost a two-day workshop for high school teachers, advanced high schoolstudents, and undergraduate students with an interest in high schoolteaching.

In addition, two postdoctoralstudents and roughly two graduate students will be supportedthroughout the project NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This Communicating Research to Public Audiences (NSF 03-509) project in partnership with the American Museum of Natural History seeks to increase public understanding of research being conducted at the Pierre Auger Observatory that will be shown in 22 science centers and available on the web, as well as live interactive presentations by the lead researchers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Grassland degradation is a global concern, affecting not only wild species and pastoralists who rely on healthy grasslands for their survival, but also non-local people who suffer from resultant hydrological disturbances, dust storms, commodity scarcity, and social consequences of uprooted people.  Livestock grazing is the dominant form of land use in Central Asia, and pastures of the Tibetan highlands are located upstream and upwind of roughly 40 percent of the world's human population.  Grasslands on the Tibetan plateau usually are described as increasingly degraded.  Causes for this grassland degradation are variously attributed to over-stocking of livestock, poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, alteration of land-tenure arrangements, rapid changes in socioeconomic systems, climate change, and excessive herbivory and soil disturbance from wildlife.  Prior research has yet to provide clear support for any putative causative agents, however, and previous studies have not examined interactions and complexity among these factors.  As a result, policy choices to reduce or reverse grassland degradation often are made without a clear rationale and are based more on prejudice or convenience than evidence of their effectiveness.  This interdisciplinary project will examine multiple correlates of grassland status and trends simultaneously, using replicated measurements at permanent plots in a multi-strata design, measuring the strength of evidence for various competing hypotheses.  The investigators will link ecological measurements directly to current and recent historical actions by pastoralists, which in turn are affected by cultural norms, economic incentives, and policies of central and provincial governments.  In addition to biophysical attributes of each site, livestock density and pasture usage patterns will be quantified.  Each site also will be described by the particular grazing strategy employed by the pastoralist managing it, and that strategy, in turn, will be related to the complex of economic and policy incentives and historical determinants that pastoralists face.  These data will be used to develop models that link broad historical, policy, economic, and cultural factors to local grassland conditions as mediated by the agency of individual pastoralists.  The models can also be used to evaluate the implications of different policy interventions.This project will deepen basic understanding of the complex interactions involving geophysical, biological, social, and policy factors and feedback systems that affect grassland status.  Because multiple factors affect grasslands simultaneously and interactions are critical, the interdisciplinary, the systems-approach adopted by this project is fundamental.  Enhanced understanding of this socioecological system will provide important input for policies on grassland restoration, biodiversity, and economic development in arid ecosystems worldwide.  In addition to the education and training of students, the project will train a number of Tibetan field assistants, and the researchers will coordinate their work closely with local and provincial grassland and forestry officials.  Direct collaboration with Chinese scientists and officials as well as facilitated workshops will enable research results to be understood by policy makers.  Direct interactions with local pastoralists will allow immediate, practical applications of project results.   This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) provides a universal theory of the properties of condensed matter.  This theory, for which W. Kohn received the 1998 Nobel Prize, has revolutionized practical calculations.  Nevertheless, the theory is based on an average, non-interacting description, and ultimately fails at long time scales.  Thus one of the challenges of modern theoretical physics is to develop methods that go beyond this average picture.  A practical solution would be transformative.  Our multi-disciplinary project addresses this challenge by exploiting real-time approaches.   Specifically we will use a combination of real-time DFT and explicit treatments of additional degrees of freedom such as collective coordinates and atomic positions, which are appropriate for problems in materials science and nuclear physics.  Such dynamic approaches naturally mix configurations, and provide a common framework for treating long-time behavior in various applications.  Though the above extensions are currently computationally demanding, they are likely feasible with expected increases in computer power, together with theoretical and algorithmic advances made possible by the CDI.  The broader impacts of a successful methodology are of considerable theoretical and practical importance.   For example, going beyond Kohn-Sham DFT could likely enable new discoveries ranging from nuclear structure and reactions to technology including electronics, photonics, and catalysis.  In addition, the focus on computational techniques will bring advanced computer science methods, computer codes, and high performance computational methods into theoretical physics and materials science, and will help train a new generation of scientists NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Scientists and supporters of science have long worked to improve the sharing, reuse, storage, and retrieval of scientific data.  Today, efforts focus on advanced  cyberinfrastructure : using networked computers, databases, and organizations to bridge divides among diverse scientific disciplines.  Cyberinfrastructure divides into three main activities. First, large numbers of automatic sensors monitor subjects of interest, such as ecosystems and Earth's climate, producing massive volumes of digitized data.  Second, in many fields computer models have replaced laboratory experiments as the principal means of data collection, prediction, and decision-making.  Third, increasingly vast data resources (scientific memory) are now available, but are often distributed across thousands of research sites and institutions, in numerous incompatible formats.  For cyberinfrastructure-enabled science to deliver on its transformative potential, cyberinfrastructure designers need better ways of understanding how scientists actually create and share data in practice, and how they use it to create new knowledge.  To investigate data practices empirically, this project examines four large cyberinfrastructure efforts: the Long Term Ecological Research Network, the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, the WATer and Environmental Research Systems Network, and the Earth System Modeling Framework.  In each case, the investigators will study how cyberinfrastructure is used in monitoring, modeling, and memory.  These projects spread across many disciplines addressing three important domains, all related to climate change concerns: ecology and environment; hydrology and water management; and earth system science.  In conducting the project, the investigators will develop innovative methods of distributed ethnography, collaborative history, and multimodal network analysis.  In addition to published findings, the project will produce a 'best practices' handbook meant to guide data practices and coordination in cyberinfrastructure.  The project will partner with organizations working to enhance the role of women in computing; to build database systems for American Indian communities; and to engage other groups often ignored in information infrastructure development.  The project will thus lay groundwork for an inclusive, theoretically rich, and practically engaged social science of cyberinfrastructure NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Geometric topology was once a fringe topic, well studied in graduate schools but almost unknown in mainstream culture. Happily, in recent years public interest has increased. The key to effectively presenting geometric topology to a broad audience is to keep in mind that explanations using words alone are sure to fail.  Explanations using pictures will convey a vague sense of the intended meaning. But to deeply understand the topology of a multi-connected space, the learner must experience the space for him or herself. One of the P.I.'s missions in life --- and the subject of the present project --- is to provide computer software that enables children and other non-specialists to experience 2-manifolds, 3-manifolds, and other structures directly. For example, the P.I.'s existing Torus Games have already proved effective with students from fifth grade on up, leading them to the mind-stretching concept of multiconnected spaces (specifically, the flat 2-torus and the flat Klein bottle). The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include spherical and hyperbolic 2-manifolds as well as 3-manifolds.While mathematicians' and physicists' understanding of space has made tremendous progress, the general public's understanding still lags behind.  Part of the reason is that, while the modern concept of space is not inherently difficult to understand, it is extremely difficult to explain in words. Explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate.  The only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp a new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself.  The P.I.'s existing Torus Games software lets students develop a gut-level understanding of spaces that are finite yet have no boundaries;  this software is widely used in middle and high schools and is effective with students from fifth grade on up.  The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include curved spaces as well as flat ones, and 3-dimensional spaces as well as  toy  2-dimensional ones.  Cosmologists are currently investigating the hypothesis that the real universe might be finite, but no matter whether that hypothesis is ultimately accepted or rejected, spaces of all sorts (flat and curved, finite and infinite, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) play a pervasive role throughout physics and mathematics, and merit a broader understanding in our culture as a whole NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports theoretical research and education on spin ordering and transport in correlated electronic and atomic systems. The PI will investigate problems in the collective spin physics of correlated electron materials and Bose-Einstein condensates of atoms with nonzero spin. The research is divided into three subfields: spin transport phenomena related to the new class of materials called ''topological insulators''; quantum effects on the phase ordering and coherent dynamics of spinor Bose condensates; applications of quantum information ideas to improved characterization and simulation of frustrated magnets. In each of these subfields, the research builds on the PI?s work performed under prior NSF support. The key elements in the first research area are to understand how correlation physics is modified in a topological insulator and to describe three dimensional topological insulators in greater depth. In the second area, the PI studies effects of topological defects and dipolar interactions on the quantum theory of Bose condensates with spin, as these are believed to be essential for the interpretation of experiments. In the third area, the research tests specific proposals for DMRG-like algorithms in dimension greater than one on frustrated magnetic models of current experimental interest.The work has broader impact beyond the specific research investigations including education and relevance to emerging device technologies.   The work on spin transport in solids is currently of great interest in the applied semiconductor community, and devices using the quantum nature of electron spin are in development.  The research is relevant to ideas of future use of spinor Bose condensates as ultrasensitive magnetic field detectors with spatial resolution finer than in the best existing devices with applications beyond MRI devices. Scientifically, improved algorithms to find ground states of local Hamiltonians are important  in many areas of physics. This award has educational befits, the first being support of graduate students who will use the research as the basis for the Ph.D. Dissertation.  The work influences the efforts of the PI in course development and undergraduate student research supervision within the university.   With this award, the PI will continue development of on line educational materials with Lawrence Hall of Science as the major component of the outreach program, in conjunction with annual public lectures or panels for high school students.NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education on the recently discovered phenomena of electrical signals that are not associated with moving electrical charges, but rather associated with the seeming intrinsic rotation or spin that electron possess and the way groups of electrons transfer spin spatially.  The phenomena are not unrelated to magnetism which also is connected to the intrinsic electron spin.  The phenomena have been observed, but the theoretical explanation is less clear and the research seeks to clarify physical mechanisms and thereby add to the ability to control and utilize the phenomenon in device technology. Eventually, this may be the basis of electronic logic devices that are orders of magnitude faster and more efficient that the current transistor technology based on charge movement and charge accumulation.The work has broader impact beyond the specific research investigations including education and relevance to emerging device technologies.   The work on spin transport in solids is currently of great interest in the applied semiconductor community, and devices using the quantum nature of electron spin are in development.

Cain Center for Scientific, Technological, Engineering and Mathematical Literacy.  The PI/Co-PIs have altogether 50 on-going education/mentoring/research grants; the majority of those are funded by NSF.  These projects are currently supporting over 50 Ph.D. students, 300 undergraduate students, hundreds of high school teachers, and thousands of K-12 students. Therefore, an integration of those programs under the umbrella of NSF/Innovation through Institutional Integration (I3) is appropriate. While all other projects on campus will be invited to participate, we will ensure that, under the overall leadership of OSI, the integration and coordination of a critical pool of core projects will be made through their PI/Co-PIs. Integration of the various projects will be a challenging bureaucratic, cultural and programmatic enterprise. It will be necessary to cross department and college boundaries, address different academic cultures and norms, and ensure the integrity of the programs, especially with regard to adding to and not diluting their impact.  To accomplish this, the integration efforts will be coordinated by OSI and led by the PIs/Co-PIs of the various projects.  The I3 project will focus on the following: (1) Consolidation of Summer Workshops and Camps for Students, Teachers and Faculty Members; (2) Leadership Training in Academics through a Student-Governing Organization; (3) High School Math Tutoring Program by College Students; (4) Mentoring High School Louisiana Science and Engineering Fair Projects by College Students; and (5) Integration of Research into Education in Materials Engineering and Science NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization. Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project examines the structure and dynamics of social networks in the prehispanic U.S. Southwest. It examines the period of time between A.D. 1200 to 1550, when there were massive displacements of population that coincided with the formation of large, aggregated villages throughout the area. Using information culled from unpublished and published reports, museum collections, and limited archaeological fieldwork it supplements an existing database of known Native American settlements in the region that was developed with prior NSF funding. The project has five major goals. First is to add material culture information (especially ceramics and obsidian) to an existing GIS that contains only spatial data developed by the Center for Desert Archaeology. This GIS database includes roughly 2000 late prehispanic sites across the Southwest. Second is to characterize the structure and dynamics of social networks in the area during a period of great population flux and pan-regional interconnectivity. The third is to apply new methods and theories of social network analysis from sociology, Geographic Information System (GIS), physics, and mathematics to archaeology. Fourth, researchers are to test current theories about network structure and change using high-resolution archaeological data. And fifth, the researchers are to integrate social network theory with powerful tools of spatial analyses such as GIS. Southwest archaeology has the potential to provide a  deep time  perspective on the rise and fall of social networks within a relatively controlled and circumscribed environment. Social network analysis has largely concentrated on contemporary examples and this is the first application of social network theory and methods to a regional archaeological database that measures change over centuries and that is more analogous to the kinds of interactions that take place in many non-urban settings throughout the world. Project results are presented in a manner accessible to the public in variety of media, including the Center for Desert Archaeology?s website, public lectures, and widely distributed publications NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award will provide funds for the base support for the Utah Cosmic Ray group that serves as host to the Telescope Array (TA) experiment. TA is a large international endeavor, located in central Utah near the town of Delta, aimed at the study of Ultra?High Energy Cosmic Rays. The High Resolution Fly?s Eye (HiRes), the previous successful enterprise of this group, has observed the long anticipated GZK cut?off in the spectrum due to interactions with the microwave background. The first data from the Auger Observatory now appear to confirm this. However, the sources of the highest energy particles and questions about how they are accelerated in the first place are among the most important topics in particle astrophysics today. One suspected source is Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) which are among the most energetic objects known in the Universe. There are tantalizing hints of correlations with BL Lac objects which are AGNs with their jets pointed towards us. The TA experiment draws on the highly successful experience of HiRes and utilizes fluorescence telescopes, a technique developed by the Utah group. TA is a hybrid experiment with the world?s largest surface scintillator array measuring the footprint of the extensive air shower when it reaches the Earth and with multiple fluorescence telescope observatories measuring the shower in the space above.After commissioning finishes later this year, TA will be the most sensitive cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere. This group plans to continue their activities in support of detector installation, commissioning and operation. With extensive experience with HiRes, the group is also taking a lead role in the analysis of TA data, especially the fluorescence analysis.ASPIRE is the Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education. Since 1997, ASPIRE has been creating some of the Web?s most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs and provides direct outreach to area teachers, students, and the public. Efforts include providing outreach and support to local groups, running summer workshop sessions for students, and visits to rural schools such as those in Millard and Delta, UT. As an outreach program, ASPIRE has been able to effectively and affordably have a great impact for a number of students and educators NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ID: 0835605Title: FY08 CDI Full Proposal Competition -Type IPI: Treacy, MichaelAbstractThis project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Using graph theory and efficient combinatorial searches, new hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be discovered. Their physical properties will be calculated and their likely usefulness for particular molecular interactions will be evaluated. Tools to assist the synthesis of particular frameworks, such as template identification, will be developed. A searchable interactive database of hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be openly available online. Users will be able to explore the physical properties of zeolites and to upload molecular shapes to find the best- matched pores. In addition, users who have synthesized a new material will be able to upload a powder diffraction pattern to find the best match, thereby accelerating the structure-solution of unknown materials. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (and filtered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization. This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures.Layperson's abstractZeolites are arguably one of the most useful classes of materials.  Their structures contain crystalline arrays of pores and open channels that are wide enough to allow small molecules such as water and light oil molecules to enter and leave. In addition, their chemical composition allows them to behave as solid acids. Because of these useful properties, zeolites are used extensively in the petrochemical industry, and there is significant effort to synthesize new zeolites with different absorption properties. Currently, the rate of discovery of new zeolites is slow, being done, essentially, through trial and error.This project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Hypothetical useful zeolites will be predicted by mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, and their physical properties will be computed in order to identify the potentially useful ones. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (andfiltered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization.  This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project proposed for this Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant is an important part of Giovanni Valente's dissetation, titled  Locality and Non-Separability in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory.  The requested amount of funding ($3000 in total) is intended to support a two-month visit to the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University, where the student will work under Prof. Hans Halvorson, who is also the co-director of Giovanni's dissertation, together with Prof. Jeffrey Bub (University of Maryland). Specifically, the goal of the research to be conducted in Princeton is to construct an algebraic formulation of Jarrett's decomposition of Bell's inequalities, isolating two conditions, called parameter independence and outcome independence. Such conditions will be then generalized to Quantum Field Theory and their close relation to the concepts of locality and separability will be discussed. Moreover, a paper published by Halvorson together with Clifton in 2001, which proves that in Algebraic Quantum Field Theory one cannot perform any local operation that destroys entanglement correlations between two spatially separated systems, will be further developed and connected to the other results of the dissertation. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the intrinsic non-separability of quantum field theory.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity consists in the attempt of clarifying the notions of locality and correlations between spatially separated systems, which have been largely discussed in Special Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, but have not been explored enough in detail in the context of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory. In particular, the literature on the topic lacks any re-formulation in algebraic terms of Jarrett's decomposition of the Bell's inequalities. Furthermore, the concept of (non-)separability has not received a rigorous formalization in the context of quantum field theory. Given the highly technical nature of the subject, the work is of interest not only for philosophy of physics, but also for mathematical physics. In fact, we intend to submit the resulting research papers to journals in both fields.   As to the broader impacts of the proposed activity, the plan is to disseminate the results of the research accomplished by Valente under the supervision of Prof. Halvorson through talks and presentations at various meetings and conferences on foundations of physics as well as on philosophy of science. It is in this spirit that one should understand one of the major objectives of the entire dissertation. That is offering a simplified discussion of the structure of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, so that its mathematical details, as well as the relevant philosophical issues, could be made accessible even to those who do not have a particularly sophisticated technical background NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER To sustainably meet the simultaneous and growing demands for water, energy, and environmental quality while protecting the welfare and tradition of affected communities, a broader view of dams is needed.  To address this need, this interdisciplinary research project will apply a new tool for evaluating the relative costs and benefits of dam construction based on multi-objective planning techniques. The Integrative Dam Assessment Modeling (IDAM) tool is designed to integrate biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives into a single cost/benefit analysis of dam construction.  Each of 27 different impacts of dam construction will be evaluated both objectively (e.g., flood protection) and subjectively (i.e., the valuation of said flood protection) by a team of decision makers.  By providing a visual representation of the costs and benefits associated with two or more dams, the IDAM tool will allow decision makers to evaluate alternatives and to articulate priorities associated with a dam project, making the decision process more informed and more transparent.  The IDAM tool will be an evolutionary step in dam evaluation.  Coupled with event chronologies and hotspot mapping of conflicts, household surveys, public-participatory geographic information systems, and hydrologic modeling, the proposed process will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding the assessment, minimization, and distribution of hydropower impacts across cultural and organizational levels and to engage stakeholders in the design process through a decision theater.Significant intellectual contributions of this project will include the use of a uniquely multidisciplinary, integrative model to understand the effects of dams through a controlled study of a complex social and environmental system in China.  The project will make several pragmatic contributions related to policy and decision making through disciplinary and interdisciplinary investigation.  The project therefore will increase understanding about the interplay of multiple impacts of dam construction in a variety of geographic contexts.  Because this collaborative effort will includes opportunities for research in undergraduate institutions, this project will support high-quality research by faculty members at two undergraduate institutions and encourage the integration of research and education.  Substantial coordination and capacity building will occur across organizations, levels of experience, and disciplines.  A broad dissemination strategy is aimed at strengthening research, teaching, and public outreach about society environment interactions in the U.S., Asia, and elsewhere.  Finally, this decision-support process will yield both new knowledge and accessible tools for improving institutions' ability to manage the social and environmental dynamics associated with dams as agents of change.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The goal of this project is to advance understanding of the behavior of terrorist organizations as agents of change. While there has been enormous interest in terrorist organizations, especially since the events of 9/11, systematic unclassified empirical data on terrorist organizations, along with similar political organizations that choose not to use terrorism, has never before been collected and analyzed. This project addresses this knowledge gap by assembling a major new dataset and then uses the tools of the social and behavioral sciences to develop and test models that predict which political organizations are most likely to use terrorist violence to pursue goals.This project generates interdisciplinary insights into the behavior of political organizations as a function of local, national, and international political, social, and economic variables, as well as organizational characteristics. It accomplishes this by analyzing terrorist organization behavior as part of a larger social ecology. The project involves a partnership of more than 15 researchers from 3 major research universities and represents a range of academic disciplines, all of whom share a substantive interest in the dynamics of human behavior. Political scientists, criminologists, and sociologists collaborate to construct integrated models of organizational behavior that take into account the broadly defined context in which an organization operates, building upon existing theories and concepts about social mobilization, political violence, and criminal gang behavioral dynamics. Moreover, computer scientists on our research team provide insights on how information extraction tools can most efficiently classify data to determine if it meets key conditions. Computer scientists and social scientists work together to develop optimal protocols for combining automated and non-automated data-collection efforts specific to the topic of politically active organizations. The combination of these processes allows for transformative research into the dynamics of terrorism, pushing well beyond current theoretical and methodological boundaries.The impact of the data, methods and analyses resulting from this project extends beyond the academic community to the policy realm. The core question?under what conditions does an organization turn to terrorism to pursue its political and social agenda??is of fundamental importance to governments around the world, and the research team assembled for this effort is well positioned to ensure that the knowledge gained from this effort is transferred to interested public officials. The research home for this project is the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a Center of Excellence of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, with a mandate and the mechanisms to ensure that advances made through this research are communicated directly to the policy community NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CDI Type-I: Quantum Diffusion and Quantum RandomWalksin Physical SystemsAlexander Russell (PI), Robin C?ot´eUniversity of ConnecticutB. Project SummaryA shocking theoretical discovery of the late 90?s demonstrated that a computational apparatus directly harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics could dramatically outpace any classical computer for a number of important computational problems. This instigated a broad, ongoing effort both to implement such systems and to understand their full computational power.This project focuses on quantum random walks and quantum diffusion. Quantum random walks are important algorithmic tools appearing, for example, in the the most efficient known quantum algorithms for basic problems such as element distinctness (that is, the problem of determining if an element?such as a name or a number?appears twice in a long list) and evaluation of certain logic circuits. Quantum random walks are particularly attractive from the standpoint of implementation as they are presumably simpler to faithfully implement than a general purpose quantum computer. In particular, they possess a direct connection to quantum diffusion, an area of ultracold atomic physics. Our goal is to give the first rigorous analysis of a realistic quantum random walk and, thus, a clear indication of a candidate quantum system for implementing such walks.Intellectual merit. In this proposal, we intend to join forces of two new subfields of computer science and physics, namely quantum random walks (QRW) and ultracold atomic systems. More precisely, we will explore how the tools developed to investigate quantum random walks in simple models can be adapted to more realistic situations corresponding to physical systems of interest. Conversely, we will study realistic physical systems that could be engineered to correspond to models solvable with quantum random walks.These two complementary approaches will lead to insight about the complex underlying behavior of systems where quantum diffusion is crucial. Additionally, a large class of systems in condensed matter physics andatomic, molecular, and optical physics ? such as high-temperature superconductors or quantum magnets ? are thought to be described by models, such as the Bose-Hubbard model or one of its many generalizations,where quantum diffusion plays a key role. We plan to explore how one can control such systems so that simplified experimental setups, such as ultracold Rydberg atoms or ultracold atom-ion mixtures, can be exploited to mimic the simple models where the solutions to quantum random walks (and thus quantumdiffusion) are known.Broader impacts. We will continue our successful training efforts via the REU program (we have introduced dozens of students to real research topics) and graduate research guidance. Additionally, the PIs will develop and teach a multidisciplinary course entitled ?Quantum information and computation.?Within KAST (Kids Are Scientists Too), a 5-day program for 4th through 9th grade students, we will build new modules based on children?s fascination with technologies and computers. Additionally, the PIs will continue involvement in the DaVinci project, a program introducing high-school teachers to topics inengineering, mathematics, and physics that can be integrated into their high school science curricula.B-1 NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The National Science Foundation's Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program has been directed at underwriting the development of fundamental knowledge, including theories, data, tools and human capital. The SciSIP program also seeks to develop a community of experts across academic institutions and disciplines focused on SciSIP. The workshop and follow on activities are designed to contribute to both objectives.Intellectual MeritThe workshop is designed to:- Provide the SciSIP program with an opportunity to have a collegial discussion of the work in progress under SciSIP's first two rounds of awards well before this work begins to appear in professional forums and publications.- Provide a common forum for researchers from the diverse set of disciplinary perspectives reflected in SciSIP's awards to exchange information about work in progress, while subjecting each approach to collegial review;- Pose questions/openings to grantees to consider how their current grants might be extended, revised, augmented to more directly consider national science and innovation policy issues;- Identify gaps in SciSIP's areas of emphasis.The attendees include approximately 40 recipients of SciSIP awards, NSF personnel, and representatives from a cross-section of governmental, academic, and non-governmental organizations.The rationale for a bridge building activity among researchers and practitioners is grounded in a corpus of research literature which documents the importance of such workshops in fostering substantive dialogue across analytical perspectives.Broader ImpactTwo follow on activities will highlight SciSIP's activities and the workshop's findings. The first of these is a report based on a distillation of the workshop's discussions augmented by essays by the co-PIs and distributed widely. The second is a special panel  The Current and Emerging Status of the Science of Science and Innovation Policy , devoted to the workshop's findings, and organized at the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences' AAAS Forum on Science & TechnologyPolicy NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0743933GhiorsoThis award provides funding to improve the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR) and to develop a mechanism for interoperability of LEPR with the EarthChem database.  LEPR is a relational database of compositional and ancillary data from almost 7,000 magmatic phase equilibrium experiments.  The EarthChem data base contains composition, geographic distribution and other data on over 230,000 naturally occurring igneous rocks.  The goals of the project are:  1)  to streamline and partially automate the process of data entry to LEPR in order to facilitate updates and to enable potential contributors in the community of experimentalists to archive their published and unpublished data, 2)  to improve query capabilities, incorporate modeling tools for analysis of data subsets, and develop practical examples of manipulating data in LEPR in order to motivate use of the database for research and for pedagogical purposes, and 3) to develop a process that will allow users to cross correlate data between LEPR and the EarthChem igneous rock databse.The enhancements to LEPR and the establishment of LEPR-EarthChem interoperability will enable a wider community of scientists to make use of these databases for research and for teaching.  Students will have access to real-world data for projects without the hassle of having to gather data from a number of disparate sources.  Most importantly, an enhanced LEPR and the LEPR-EarthChem connection will create a data-mining environment that promotes synthesis and model development from diverse data sources NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop new methodologies for understanding hurricane evacuations by integrating behavioral modeling of household decision making with dynamic transportation modeling. By understanding evacuation decision making, the research will contribute to improving the efficiency of hurricane evacuation.This project will develop novel modeling approaches to: (1) Estimate the social, demographic and cultural characteristics that influence household evacuation decision making from surveys of Miami-Dade County residents; (2) Understand how people synthesize evacuation warnings up to the time they make the decision to evacuate;(3) Assess the influence of household decisions based on spatial location; (4) Estimate the temporal variation of evacuees from the time of warning; (5) Determine the optimal time of departure, optimal route and destination choice based on the temporal demand patterns; (6) Incorporate behavioral rules obtained from social science analysis to simulate the transportation system impacts; and (7) Identify ways to distribute the obtained results from multiple hurricane scenarios to stakeholders.The project will use multidisciplinary approaches to understand hurricane evacuation by bringing together approaches from social science, network optimization, agent-based modeling, transportation operations, stochastic optimization and hurricane emergency response NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Holocaust was a profoundly geographical event that caused mass displacement and migration, destroyed or fundamentally changed thousands of communities, and created hundreds of new places for the concentration of population, the exploitation of labor, and the mass murder of millions of people. Yet its spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics have scarcely been studied as explicitly geographical phenomena. Nor have scholars critically considered the complex and varied range of spatial scales at which the events constituting the Holocaust took place, from the individual body to the continental expanse of Europe. Through a partnership with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) and access to its exceptionally detailed datasets, the research team will build a set of GIS applications and geovisualizations to carry out four overlapping and interlinked case studies on (1) the evolution of the spatial system of concentration camps; (2) a comparative study of victim transports from France and Italy; (3) a localized study of forced evacuations or death marches from concentration camps at the end of WWII; and (4) a detailed study of the Budapest ghetto. These cases have been chosen for their suitability for GIScience modeling and analysis at a variety of scales and because they represent the range of spatial experiences of Holocaust victims (ghettoization, transportation, incarceration in the concentration camp system).This project will be the first systematic examination of the geographies of the Holocaust. Previous historical scholarship on the Holocaust has focused on Nazi policy, individual camps, particular atrocities, or the history of certain communities, groups, or nations. This project will take a synoptic view of the Holocaust as a multi-layered, multi-scaled event and analyze it by employing geographic information science (GIScience methodologies. For GIScience, the challenges posed by historical source data make this project a significant opportunity to advance new approaches to metadata and source interpretation. Our research methods will provide models for other scholars working in historical GIS as well. Few studies have moved historical GIS (HGIS) beyond the important but conceptually limited stage of infrastructure development to grapple with substantive research questions. Even fewer HGIS projects have examined historical events or conditions of major social significance. This project does both.The results of this project will be disseminated through professional conference presentations, a final workshop at the USHMM open to the general public, peer-reviewed journal articles, a book co-edited by the two PIs with contributions from all the project's participants, and an interactive website on the Geographies of the Holocaust to be built and hosted at the USHMM. Finally, data and GIS applications will be deposited at the USHMM Archives and the Registry of Survivors for long-term preservation and dissemination NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CERN'S Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ranks among the top scientific endeavors of the decade.  Although predictions vary as to precisely what will be observed at this new energy frontier, theorists are in broad agreement that something new will be discovered.  The excitement surrounding this scientific opportunity has led to a sharp increase in the number of graduates seeking to pursue research at the LHC for their Ph.D dissertations.Because of the unprecedented scale and complexity of the LHC detectors, working on the commissioning of such detectors provides the students with a highly valuable experience which contributes to their education in ways that simply cannot be duplicated. Moreover, meaningful participation requires a physical presence at CERN. With the imminent turn-on of the LHC, the next few years provide a special window of opportunity. However, the combined effect of sharply increased student interest in the LHC, higher living costs in Geneva and the weakening of  the U.S. dollar, has made student support more problematic. To ensure that students will have time at CERN,  this proposal comprises a program consisting of  about 10 special single-year (non-renewable) travel supplements per year, for three years, awarded competitively, for US CMS graduate students to be resident at CERN during the one-year period of their support. With regard to broader impact, the recipients will be ?natural ambassadors? in two senses.  First, their day-to-day interactions with counterparts from other countries will lead to friendships that will promote mutual understanding in the near term and may lead to future international scientific collaborations. Second, upon their return to the U.S. they will be integrated into US CMS? existing Education and Outreach program, where their relative youth makes them plausible role models for potential scientists of high-school and middle-school age NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The physics of the interaction of intense laser light with plasma when wavelength-scale particles are irradiated is investigated. While the nature of strong field interactions with atoms, molecules, small clusters and planar solids has been studied extensively for many years, how intense laser pulses interact with objects that are of a spatial scale comparable to the light?s wavelength is largely unexplored. These interactions are likely to exhibit properties which are quite distinct from the interactions of intense pulses with single atoms and molecules on one hand and large planar solid plasmas on the other. This work fills this gap in strong field physics with careful, well-designed experiments that isolate the effects which are peculiar to wavelength-scale targets. Previously, our investigations showed that strong field interactions could be enhanced by an appropriate choice of target particle size. Boundary conditions imposed by the particles create Mie enhancements in the local laser field and thereby increase the nonlinear response of the interaction. The specific focus of the current work is motivated by an important question that arose from our previous experimental and computation studies: is the nature of collisionless absorption by hot electrons around wavelength-scale plasmas different from collisionless absorption from a simple planar solid? A number of theories have recently surmised that such absorption is different at these scales, dominated by what has been termed multi-pass stochastic heating, in which hot electrons can absorb energy from the laser field by passing back and forth multiple times through the micron-scale plasma. This novel heating mechanism has been suggested as being important in a number of experiments and particle-in-cell simulations but there has as yet been no systematic experimental investigation. The current studies are designed to address this shortcoming. The experiments are designed to directly measure the electron and ion distributions generated in the collisionless heating process, and, by studying specific scalings in particles of well defined size, ascertain the importance or existence of this stochastic heating mechanism. The studies utilize a 20 TW, high temporal contrast laser at UT, electron and ion energy diagnostics, and a novel electrostatic particle injector as a target. These experiments are complemented by simulations using codes available at UT. The work is done through a unique collaboration between an academic research lab at the University of Texas and at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), an undergraduate institution. Application of these kinds of studies may aid in the development of novel bright, laser-driven x-ray sources for radiography and time resolved diffraction, or compact neutron sources for imaging of other scientific applications. In addition to these scientific impacts, this collaborative work promises to make a significant and somewhat novel impactin graduate and undergraduate education. In addition to its scientific merit, and support of graduate student research at UT, this research significantly adds to the scope and number of research opportunities available to physics undergraduate students at HMC. This work represents a unique situation in which an undergraduate group is involved directly and in a critical way in larger scale strong field optics research, a field which is otherwise prohibitively resource intensive for undergraduate-level research alone. The PIs have an excellent record of working together and meaningfully involving undergraduates in their collaborations. Undergraduates have the opportunity to do research at HMC, travel to UT in the summers to participate in research using equipment they have developed, and travel to conferences to present their work to the scientific community. This collaboration will continue to be an effective way to motivate undergraduates to seeking advanced degrees in science. Furthermore the PIs will continue to disseminate their work through publication in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and international conference as they have done actively during the past funding period.Funds for this award are provided by the Physics Division within the NSF's Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences of the DoE within the context of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Using a theme of urban hydrology, eight to ten hands-on laboratory experiences that employ a constructivist approach, project-based learning style are being developed by researchers at The College at Brockport State University of New York, in collaboration with teachers from the Rochester (NY) City School District.  The urban hydrology theme is both one of interest and concern to scientists investigating environmental issues and one that students see on a daily basis.  This approach is expected to capture students' attention using a relevant topic, easily transferred to other urban settings, and increase the skills and achievements of a diverse population of urban students in using inquiry-based hands-on science focused on geoscience topics.  The overall project, and curriculum development efforts, are addressing three overarching goals: 1) to engage students in 'doing' science, to better enable them to understand the nature of science, 2) to have students better understand the realities upon which scientific theories are built, and 3) to provide students with experiences using modern equipment that enables them to build their own robust data sets, develop ownership of a project, and make science fun.  Data are being collected to evaluate both teacher and student response to the project and newly developed curricular materials NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project investigates the interplay of nonlinear dynamics and random abiotic fluctuations on distribution and abundance of interacting populations. To investigate this interplay, the theory of random dynamical systems which combines dynamical systems techniques with probabilistic machinery are applied to a class of random ecological maps sufficiently general to account for spatial structure, stage structure, and multispecies interactions. New mathematical methods for verifying stochastic dissipativeness, persistence, and extinction will be developed. The application of these methods to populations dispersing in random environments, the storage effect and the Allee effect in stage-structured populations, random replicator dynamics, and antagonistic interactions of ideal free populations in source-sink environments will be pursued. For models of structured populations, new methods will be developed for understanding monotonicity and convexity properties of the dominant Lyapunov exponent for parameterized families of random products of non-negative matrices. Since these dominant Lyapunov exponents determine the asymptotic growth rate of populations at low densities, they are critical for understanding persistence.The interaction between environmental fluctuations, for example those due to anthropogenic disturbances or weather, and biological processes can dramatically affect the outcomes of species interactions. Consequently, the applications of the mathematical techniques developed in this project may be of practical value to the conservation or the restoration of ecological communities, the prevention of biological invasions, the management of natural resources, and biological control of agricultural pests NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project is designed to develop a long-term international collaborative research and education effort among research teams at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) and S.N. Bose National Center for Basic Sciences, in Kolkota, India.  The research focuses on investigating the influence of local structure on the physical properties of complex oxides. This class of materials exhibit many interesting phenomena, for example, coupled structural transitions and collective electronic effects such as metal-insulator transitions, phase separation at low temperatures, and multiferroic behavior. This research collaboration intends to address the important issue of sample quality, which often leads to contradictory results; controlling sample quality is important to understand the manifestly different physical behavior. The specific objectives of the project include: synthesis and characterization of high quality samples of these complex oxides in both the US and Indian laboratories; determination of the electronic properties using photoelectron spectroscopies; measurement of local structure using x-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory; and generation of high impact scientific and technological results along with an understanding of many-body interactions using theoretical tools.  The results of these studies are expected to resolve several outstanding questions in this field and contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of these materials, which are promising candidates for potential applications in data manipulation and storage. Furthermore, the complementary expertise of the collaborating research groups provides an ideal opportunity to train graduate students and junior researchers through extended visits to the collaborating laboratories. The students and junior researchers who participate in these exchanges will gain technical expertise and will develop international collaborations, which will benefit their careers.  Training gained by junior Indian researchers at the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, will prepare them to take leadership roles in the development and use of the synchrotron source in India.  Inclusion of summer IIT undergraduate student interns in the project is designed to provide hands-on scientific research experience in an international setting and expose them to career opportunities through graduate studies. This award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering ?Africa, Near East & South Asia Program NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award to University of California-Los Angeles by the Solid State Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research is to grow single crystals of Rhenium diboride (ReB2) and to measure the physical properties of ReB2 as a function of crystallographic orientation.  The hardness of ReB2 will then be enhanced by forming solid solutions and synthesizing dense nanocrystalline composites.  In other studies, rhenium will be replaced completely with other transition metals such as Titanium while maintaining the ReB2 structure type. These approaches may enable to construct new ultra-incompressible, superhard materials using less expensive metals. The search for new ultra-incompressible, superhard materials holds both scientific and practical interest.  The proposed design plan is to combine high valence electron density transition metals with small main group elements to replace the weak metallic bonds with strong covalent bonds. Using this approach, it is possible to convert relatively soft rhenium metal into an extremely hard Rhenium diboride, which has many exciting physical properties including low incompressibility, high hardness, and the ability to scratch diamond.  Synthesis and testing of coatings will be carried out in conjunction with a local company that specializes in developing ultra-hard coatings. Hardness, fracture toughness and Young?s modulus will be determined by indentation techniques. Radial diffraction experiments will also be used to determine the mechanical properties of these materials.  As part of this project, an outreach program be developed entitled ?It?s a Material World? that is suitable for both undergraduate students and general audiences. This course will be offered to UCLA undergraduates each year to enhance their interest in materials chemistry. In addition, materials developed for this course will be used for interactive seminars with both high school and middle school students. The main thrust of the proposal is to synthesize crystals of Rhenium Diboride and other structurally related borides of transition metals such as Titanium.  Using this approach, it is possible to convert relatively soft metals into extremely hard materials, which are harder than diamond.  The search for new ultra-incompressible, superhard materials holds both scientific and practical interest in a number of applications. An outreach program will be developed entitled ?It?s a Material World? that is suitable for both undergraduate students at the campus and general audiences. This program offered to non-science undergraduate students is to enhance their interest in science in general and materials science in particular. In addition, materials developed for this course will be used for interactive seminars with both high school and middle school students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The investigators study R&D environments where opportunities to invest are constrained by imagination as well as by resources. This simple and realistic premise has many implications for the design of intellectual property, as well as for other institutions that support R&D.First, since ideas for investments do not arrive simultaneously, there is a tradeoff between preserving options and the cost of delay. Investing early can preempt investments in better ideas that arrive later.  An incentive problem arises because a private recipient of an idea may not reap the social benefit of preserving options. This leads to the question of how to organize incentives so that recipients of ideas take account of social options.The investigators characterize a socially optimal threshold for accepting an idea rather than discarding it. The threshold is on the net social value. They prove that the threshold should become less discriminating as time passes without filling the market niche.  They then study how reward mechanisms can (or cannot) achieve that outcome. Patents are an imperfect tool because their private value cannot be tailored to R&D cost. Patent value does not scale with social value. In the special case where ideas differ only in the quality of the innovation, but not in R&D cost, patents will over-encourage low-cost ideas with low quality, and under-encourage high-value ideas that also have high cost. Prizes might do better, for example, when ideas differ only in their R&D costs. The prize should increase with delay. Second, because ideas must be compared in order to find the best one, it may be optimal to collect ideas, as venture capitalists do. The investigators illuminate the tension between the social benefits of allowing venture capitalists to collect and screen ideas, and the competitive goals of the patent system. They show that the optimal reward system must be more generous when ideas are aggregated in the hands of a few venture capitalists than when widely dispersed.Third, the scarcity of ideas explains the open-source movement in a new way.  In many arenas, there cannot be ideas for further advance unless previous technologies are disclosed. If ideas are scarce, the relevant disclosure cannot be accomplished under contract, because it is not known where the next idea will surface. The disclosure and sharing obligations of the open source community overcome this problem.Finally, the scarcity of ideas has implications for public funding. Unlike patents and prizes, public support can be given when the innovator actually needs it, which is before investing. However, giving the money in advance creates a problem for knowing which researchers to fund, especially when the researchers have different idiosyncratic ideas, and different idiosyncratic capabilities. The investigators characterize the optimal blend of pre-screening and experience rating, especially when it is understood that even good ideas may fail. The project brings economic theory into closer contact with the R&D experience of recent decades. For example, the scarcity of ideas should lead to economic profit, as it did in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, rather than to the profit dissipation predicted by patent races. The project's broader impact is on the design of programs for funding R&D NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Significance and importance of the project.  The initiation of earthquakes on faults in the Earth?s crust is controlled, incredibly, by physical processes that occur at microscopic contacts between rough surfaces of rock that touch along the fault.  Despite the success of empirical friction equations in describing the results of laboratory friction experiments and producing a variety of earthquake-related phenomena in computer models of earthquakes, these equations lack a physical basis.  That is, the precise identity and nature of the physical mechanisms that  occur at microscopic contacts, and give rise to the observed friction effects in experiments, remain unknown.  The empirical nature of the descriptions reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying the physical processes at microscopic fault contacts.  Without a sound physical understanding, we remain limited in our abilities to reliably apply the equations to earthquakes in nature, to obtain a better general understanding of the earthquake process, and to ultimately make reliable predictions of earthquakes.  In this transformative study, we will make use of state-of-the-art materials science testing methods, namely atomic force microscopy and Nanoindentation, to provide a physical basis for friction observations at a coarser scale and thereby gain a much improved understanding of the earthquake process.  This work may allow us to learn whether we are likely to be able to detect accelerating creep on faults just prior to an earthquake and thereby predict earthquakes days to hours before an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to the built environment.  From the perspective of the scientific fields of mechanics and materials science, these new insights, gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales, have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. Technical description. The overarching goals of the proposed studies are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at asperity contacts at frictional interfaces.  A more specific major goal of our study is to understand the origin of the friction state ?evolution? effect in rate and state friction, the simplest manifestation of which is an increase in ?static? friction with the time of quasi-stationary contact.  To that end, we will conduct a coordinated, interdisciplinary collaboration that will employ laboratory experiments that investigate frictional phenomena over a wide range of length scales. One outcome will be to develop constitutive equations that will allow extrapolation of these mechanisms to the elevated temperatures and longer times relevant for earthquakes. We will perform macro-scale friction experiments on rocks at Brown University, micro-scale to nano-scale indentation creep, adhesion, and friction experiments in the Nanoindenters at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and nano-scale adhesion and friction experiments in atomic force microscopes at the University of Pennsylvania. To make connections between the different types of experiments and to isolate different origins of the state evolution effect, we will vary the same environmental conditions in all three sets of experiments. These include tests as a function of humidity, pH (in liquid), and temperature. All three environmental factors have been demonstrated to influence the evolution effect in macroscopic rock friction experiments. Nanoindentation and AFM measurements should allow us to determine the processes on an asperity scale responsible for the macroscopic behavior NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal is focused on problems in applied mathematics which may be attacked using algebraic methods. There are three themes:  (1) Information transmission and coding theory, (2) Rational surface modeling and implicitization, and (3) Approximation theory and multidimensional splines.  The main goal of the project is to bring the full power of abstract machinery to bear on these themes; frequently the key to solving an applied problem is to view it from a different perspective.  For example, in past work, the PI has used spectral sequences and local cohomology to study splines; in coding theory the PI has used toric geometry and Cayley-Bacharach theory to obtain good bounds on certain codes obtained from algebraic geometry. The coding theory portion of the project will focus on finding optimal codes from toric varieties of dimension three or more; on the spline front the PI will investigate splines on polyhedral complexes, as well as the efficacy of the Groebner basis algorithm as a symbolic algebra front end for spline computations. Finally, an exciting new interaction between computer science (specifically, computer vision and animation) and algebra involves rational surface modeling: if a map is defined from the plane to three-space by three rational functions, what is the (unique) polynomial vanishing on the image? Here there is again a fruitful interplay with commutative algebra; the most efficient way to determine the polynomial involves syzygies (relations among the functions which define the map); the aim is to obtain fast algorithms to determine the polynomial vanishing on the image.One of the fundamental problems in information theory is that of signal transmission; applications range from CD systems to space communication. In a perfect world, the signal sent from point A and the signal which arrives at point B are identical. In the real world, the medium over which the signal is transmitted is not perfect (there is noise), and so errors are introduced into the signal. In signal processing jargon, the transmitted signal consists of code words, and the study of how to clean up the signal is called ``coding theory''. So the problem is simple: how does one catch the errors? The solution is to introduce some additional information into the transmission, so that the receiver at point B can strip off the errors and recover the original signal. It turns out that codes which are obtained from certain geometric objects can sometimes be optimal (that is, not too much redundant information needs to be added). One aim of this proposal is to discover more such codes. A second theme of the proposal involves computer vision and animation. Given a surface and a point in space, the goal is to decide if the point lies on the surface (this arises, for example, in plotting the image of a character in an animated movie). This is easy to do if the surface is given by an equation f(x,y,z)=0 and the point p=(a,b,c); simply check if f(a,b,c)=0. The goal is to find efficient algorithms to determine f(x,y,z), which is typically unknown. The final theme of the proposal is to study ``splines'', which are objects used by companies like Boeing to model surfaces.  The PI will work to determine theoretical bounds on the number of splines on certain objects and will also analyze the complexity of a symbolic algebra algorithm (not currently used in the area) for computing splines. Accomplishing either of these goals could lead to an actual speed up in the software used to generate splines NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In this project the PI will study how the primate retina processes and encodes visual images. The retina is an extraordinarily sophisticated optical image detector, converting a light image into a set of electrical signals, filtering these signals both spatially and temporally, and sending the output up the optic nerve to the brain. The output signals consist of multiple trains of electrical spikes organized in an exquisite and complex way, with more than 20 separate parallel pathways carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. In pilot experiments, a number of previously unknown, or poorly known, functional types of retinal neurons have been uncovered and in this research project the PI will answer the following questions: What roles do these cell types play in retinal processing? How do these neurons respond to different kinds of visual images? What information about the outside visual world do these cells communicate to the brain, and how is this information encoded? To answer these questions, a movie will be focused on the retinal input neurons (the rod and cone photoreceptors) and the electrical spikes generated by the retinal output neurons (including the new and poorly-known cell types) will be imaged and recorded by a dense two-dimensional array of over 500 microscopic electrodes. The output signals will then be correlated in space and time among themselves and with the input visual images to probe the neural code at the retina/brain interface. This research project will aid the development of future retinal prosthetic devices that are intended to restore some visual function in blind human patients with retinas damaged by photoreceptor disease. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students in both physics and biology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0744039WalkerThis award provides funding to improve the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR) and to develop a mechanism for interoperability of LEPR with the EarthChem database.  LEPR is a relational database of compositional and ancillary data from almost 7,000 magmatic phase equilibrium experiments.  The EarthChem data base contains composition, geographic distribution and other data on over 230,000 naturally occurring igneous rocks.  The goals of the project are:  1)  to streamline and partially automate the process of data entry to LEPR in order to facilitate updates and to enable potential contributors in the community of experimentalists to archive their published and unpublished data, 2)  to improve query capabilities, incorporate modeling tools for analysis of data subsets, and develop practical examples of manipulating data in LEPR in order to motivate use of the database for research and for pedagogical purposes, and 3) to develop a process that will allow users to cross correlate data between LEPR and the EarthChem igneous rock databse.The enhancements to LEPR and the establishment of LEPR-EarthChem interoperability will enable a wider community of scientists to make use of these databases for research and for teaching.  Students will have access to real-world data for projects without the hassle of having to gather data from a number of disparate sources.  Most importantly, an enhanced LEPR and the LEPR-EarthChem connection will create a data-mining environment that promotes synthesis and model development from diverse data sources NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award provides support in part for the international workshop  At the Frontiers of Condensed Matter IV: Current Trends and Novel Materials . The workshop will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, December 9-12, 2008. The workshop is centered on theoretical developments in condensed matter with a focus that includes: high temperature superconductors, low dimensional systems, dilute magnetic semiconductors, spintronics and nanomagnetism, multiferroics and multifunctional materials, graphene and other monolayer materials. This workshop contributes to scientific exchange in growing scientific areas across the Americas. Europeans will also participate. It also enhances NSF supported international activities involving the Americas and provides an opportunity to stimulate collaborations involving various countries in the Americas. NSF support enhances participation of early-career scientists and members of underrepresented groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Status and stigma are fundamental factors that influence the ways that individuals organize themselves in social groups. Status is a social process whereby persons in groups locate themselves and others in hierarchies of influence and prestige. Stigma is a process whereby members of social groups identify certain attributes as discrediting, subjecting those who possess them to social rejection and exclusion. Research on status processes in groups has identified a number of attributes that act as status markers, including gender, race, age, and education. Research on stigma processes has also identified a number of attributes that are stigmatizing, including mental illness and physical disability. The research literatures on stigma and status have both proliferated in recent decades, but they have operated more or less independently. Mental illness and physical disability, for example, are absent from research on status processes in groups. Research on stigma, in turn, does not typically attend to status-related outcomes such as influence and performance evaluations. The investigators will carry out three studies that address areas of convergence and departure between status and stigma processes in groups.The first study is an experiment to be completed at the University of Maryland to investigate responses to an attribute identified in prior research as a status marker (educational attainment), attributes identified as stigmatizing (various categories of mental illness), and an attribute identified in research as both a marker of status and stigma (race) in order to determine ways in which reactions to the attributes overlap and diverge. The second project, to be completed at Columbia University, is a study of implicit attitudes toward persons with mental illness. Unlike self-report measures of attitudes that require the attention and control of individuals, the expression of implicit attitudes is spontaneous and unintentional. The major advantage of implicit measures is that they have the capacity to overcome social desirability biases that are common in other types of attitude measures. The third project is an audit study to test for status- and stigma-related outcomes of mental illness in employment decisions. The study involves sending job applications to employment listings, varying whether the applications specify a history of mental illness.By employing multiple methodological approaches as well as variables and measures that represent both traditions, the three studies have the potential to significantly push forward the independent research literatures on both status and stigma processes in groups. The studies also have the capacity to inform intervention programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness. Although there have been several recent calls for interventions to reduce the stigma of mental illness, most of these interventions have not included a research component. Because the interventions with the highest likelihood of success will be grounded in basic research, and because poorly grounded interventions may result in wasted resources and pessimism about our ability to reduce stigma, the proposed studies represent an important complement to more applied approaches to eradicate the stigma of mental illness NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Democratic Party's contest for the 2008 presidential nominee went on longer and divided the party more deeply than any other such contest in recent history. By contrast, the Republican Party's nomination race was relatively quick and did not generate deep fissures within the party. This research will shed light on the nature of modern political parties. The party is not the formal hierarchy it may have been a century ago, in which bosses could dictate the choice of nominee to the rank and file with little expectation of resistance. Today's parties are better thought of as networks of formal party groups, interest groups, and donors. It is these networks that allow parties to manage a crisis, such as an intraparty rift during a competitive election.The researchers will investigate these intraparty rifts and the role of social networks as part of the effort to heal them by conducting interviews of delegates to both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in August and September of 2008. Respondents will asked their opinions about the major candidates for the presidential nominations, their previous involvement in party activities, their membership in various interest groups, and their cultural beliefs about the importance of intraparty democracy. Respondents will be contacted for follow-up interviews in the late fall to determine the effect of fall campaigns on intraparty factionalism. The researchers will test the hypotheses that involvement in expanded party networks (including interest groups and party posts) mitigates this factionalism and that participation in such networks promotes loyalty to party rather than to a specific candidate.This research will have broader impacts on the way this presidential election season is understood by political observers. Rather than making assumptions about the fractious nature of the primary season and its effect on the general election, journalists and other observers will be able to draw upon our this research for concrete measurements and qualitative assessments of these rifts. Additionally, this research will also involve the use of graduate and undergraduate students at multiple institutions as survey administrators. These students will receive specialized training that will enrich their academic experiences NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The PI of this project will study questions related to the moduli spaces of sheaves and morphisms. Regarding the moduli spaces of sheaves, the main themes to be covered are: the 'strange duality' isomorphism for the moduli space of bundles on a curve as the curve varies in moduli - in particular, extensions of 'strange duality' to nodal curves and to general structure groups; the Theta bundles, their sections, and 'rank-level' dualities on the moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces (the latter in collaboration with Alina Marian); computation of intersection theoretic invariants on the moduli space of higher-rank framed/unframed sheaves on threefolds. Regarding stable morphisms, and building on previous work, the author will pursue a further study of the topology of the moduli space of stable maps and of the associated tautological systems. The projects above are aimed to the understanding of the topology, geometry and intersection theory of various moduli spaces of sheaves and morphisms. One of the goals is to exploit the inter-connections these moduli spaces enjoy.Moduli spaces arise as answers to classification and parametrization problems, putting together objects with similar structure. Questions about these objects (e.g. counting problems, questions about families) often involve a detailed study of the relevant moduli spaces. The moduli spaces of stable sheaves and stable morphisms are two of the primary examples occurring in algebraic geometry. In addition to their importance within the field, they bear multiple connections with other branches of classical and modern mathematics such as complex analysis, representation theory, theoretical physics, symplectic geometry, gauge theory, differential geometry, combinatorics and topology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The National Science Foundation (NSF) is proud to announce that 32-year-old Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles, will receive its 2008 Alan T. Waterman Award. Called a  supreme problem-solver,  and named one of  the Brilliant 10  scientists by Popular Science (October 2006), Tao's extraordinary work, much of which has been funded by NSF through the years, has had a tremendous impact across several mathematical areas. He will receive the award at a black tie dinner program at the U.S. Department of State on May 6.The annual Waterman award recognizes an outstanding young researcher in any field of science or engineering supported by NSF. Candidates may not be more than 35 years old, or seven years beyond receiving a doctorate, and must stand out for their individual achievements. In addition to a medal, the awardee receives a grant of $500,000 over a 3-year period for scientific research or advanced study in their field.Terence Tao was born in Adelaide, Australia, in 1975. His genius at mathematics began early in life. He started to learn calculus when he was 7 years old, at which age he began high school; by the age of 9 he was already very good at university-level calculus. By the age of 11, he was thriving in international mathematics competitions. Tao was 20 when he earned his doctorate from Princeton University, and he joined UCLA's faculty that year. UCLA promoted him to full professor at age 24. Tao now holds UCLA's James and Carol Collins Chair in the College of Letters and Science. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society and the Australian Academy of Sciences (corresponding member).Nicknamed  the Mozart of Math,  Tao's areas of research include partial differential equations (PDE), combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Harmonic analysis is an advanced form of calculus that uses equations from physics. Some of this work involves, in a colleague's words,  geometrical constructions that almost no one understands.  Tao also works in a related field, nonlinear partial differential equations, and in the entirely distinct fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and combinatorics, which involves counting.In addition to the prestigious Waterman award, Tao has received a number of other awards, including the Salem Prize in 2000; the Bochner Prize in 2002; the Fields Medal, often touted as the  Nobel Prize for Mathematics  and SASTRA Ramanujan Prize in 2006; and the MacArthur Fellowship and Ostrowski Prize in 2007.Through the years, Tao's research has often been funded by other NSF grants. His current research is funded by NSF Award #0649473,  Global Behaviour of Critical Nonlinear PDE NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons.  However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate a muon beam. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a synchrotron, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam. Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or cool a muon beam quickly.  The goal of MICE is to build a section of an ionization-cooling channel, instrument it to measure its cooling performance, and use a muon beam produced at a particle accelerator to demonstrate that it works as designed.  A collaborative effort of some 150 physicists and engineers from Europe, Asia, and the US, MICE is being mounted at England's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  Construction of the apparatus is currently in progress, and the running of the experiment and analysis of its results is expected to take place during the 3-year period of the grant proposed here.  This proposal requests renewal funding for the Illinois Institute of Technology MICE group in support of continued US leadership in muon cooling and in the muon accelerator facilities that might be constructed, in the US or elsewhere, once the feasibility of ionization cooling is demonstrated.  The broader impact of this work is most evident in the use of an accelerated muon beam for a Neutrino Factory recognized as the most powerful tool yet conceived in the quest to understand the mysterious oscillatory behavior of the neutrino and its possible role in the evolution of the matter-dominated Universe in which we live.  In addition, the pace of MICE development, running, and analysis is particularly well suited to the training of students.  MICE will take approximately three years to complete, a good fit to the typical physics student?s graduate training NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Holocaust was a profoundly geographical event that caused mass displacement and migration, destroyed or fundamentally changed thousands of communities, and created hundreds of new places for the concentration of population, the exploitation of labor, and the mass murder of millions of people. Yet its spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics have scarcely been studied as explicitly geographical phenomena. Nor have scholars critically considered the complex and varied range of spatial scales at which the events constituting the Holocaust took place, from the individual body to the continental expanse of Europe. Through a partnership with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) and access to its exceptionally detailed datasets, the research team will build a set of GIS applications and geovisualizations to carry out four overlapping and interlinked case studies on (1) the evolution of the spatial system of concentration camps; (2) a comparative study of victim transports from France and Italy; (3) a localized study of forced evacuations or death marches from concentration camps at the end of WWII; and (4) a detailed study of the Budapest ghetto. These cases have been chosen for their suitability for GIScience modeling and analysis at a variety of scales and because they represent the range of spatial experiences of Holocaust victims (ghettoization, transportation, incarceration in the concentration camp system).This project will be the first systematic examination of the geographies of the Holocaust. Previous historical scholarship on the Holocaust has focused on Nazi policy, individual camps, particular atrocities, or the history of certain communities, groups, or nations. This project will take a synoptic view of the Holocaust as a multi-layered, multi-scaled event and analyze it by employing geographic information science (GIScience methodologies. For GIScience, the challenges posed by historical source data make this project a significant opportunity to advance new approaches to metadata and source interpretation. Our research methods will provide models for other scholars working in historical GIS as well. Few studies have moved historical GIS (HGIS) beyond the important but conceptually limited stage of infrastructure development to grapple with substantive research questions. Even fewer HGIS projects have examined historical events or conditions of major social significance. This project does both.The results of this project will be disseminated through professional conference presentations, a final workshop at the USHMM open to the general public, peer-reviewed journal articles, a book co-edited by the two PIs with contributions from all the project's participants, and an interactive website on the Geographies of the Holocaust to be built and hosted at the USHMM. Finally, data and GIS applications will be deposited at the USHMM Archives and the Registry of Survivors for long-term preservation and dissemination NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization. Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field. This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists. In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics. Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields. In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science, we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines. With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge). It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge. Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field. The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents. The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Legislators, bureaucrats and others frequently make economic decisions that affect others.  A judge may require a defendant to pay damages to a litigant.  Congress may pass legislation that taxes one group of citizens to finance spending on another group.   Bureaucrats may impose regulations at a cost to some people to benefit others.  While economists, political scientists, psychologists, and decision scientists have studied group decision making, we do not know much about how individuals make decisions in these situations.  This research uses economic experiments to understand this kind of decision making.  The goal is to test implications of the equity theory of fairness, which predicts that a third party is less like to redistribute income and assets if he or she believes that these funds have been earned by the owner, rather than simply a result of fortune or luck.The results add to our scientific knowledge in behavioral economics, political science, law and social psychology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DEVELOPMENT / TESTING / AND MODELING OF AN INFLATABLE AERODYNAMIC DECELERATOR FOR USE IN PLANETARY ENTRY SUMMARY: The proposed study will mature deployable and inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (lAD) technology through developing the capability to comput NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Examples of plant secondary metabolites acting in a synergistic fashion as insect deterrents are not common, and many studies focus on the pharmaceutical applications of natural products where activity is serendipitous and not an evolved response. This project will test for synergy between plant products in the deterrence of insects, the activity for which they have ostensibly evolved. Synergy between compounds in a mixture produced by a single plant species (intraclass synergy) will be tested in three systems: the imides of Piper species (Piperaceae, Piperales), the iridoid glycosides of Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae, Lamiales), and the furanocoumarins of Pastinaca sativa (Apiaceae, Apiales). The imides of P. imperiale and P. melanocladum are structurally very similar to imides and amides from Piper cenocladum and P. tuberculatum which have recently been shown to act synergistically against a broad array of insects. This proposed work tests the generality of intraclass synergy for imides and amides of the genus Piper. To test if intraclass synergy is general to other classes of natural products, the iridoid glycosides (monoterpene glycosides) and furanocoumarins will be examined, since they are structurally unrelated to the Piper amides/imides and to each other, and both classes of compounds have a well documented central role in plant insect interactions.With the support of this linked collaborative award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the collaborative work of two chemists and an ecologist, Professors Craig D. Dodson and Joseph L. Richards, of the Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences at Mesa State College, and Professor Lee A. Dyer, of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University. The approach outlined in this proposal will provide novel methods for chemical ecology, bioassays, and statistical analyses. It will provide rigorous tests of important hypotheses on how intraclass compounds act synergistically to deter insects. The work will contribute to a long term goal to determine if antiherbivore synergy is widespread among plant secondary metabolites. If synergy is found to be general and widespread when testing for activity against ecologically relevant insect herbivores, then it is consistent with a general hypothesis that plants evolved multiple compounds as synergists for defense against herbivores and pathogens. These results are also directly relevant to the way insects are controlled on crops. The proposed work will continue a decade-long, successful collaboration between two chemists and an ecologist. The collaboration involves an undergraduate institution and a research university and has successfully trained a large number of graduate and undergraduate students. The current proposal includes funding for one graduate student and 12 undergraduates. Students will be broadly trained in both biology and chemistry, and the collaborators will continue to be involved with important training programs for these students at Tulane, such as Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), the Ecological Society of America's SEEDS program for minorities, the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation, and Fulbright's LASPAU program for training faculty from other countries NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Using graph theory and efficient combinatorial searches, new hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be discovered. Their physical properties will be calculated and their likely usefulness for particular molecular interactions will be evaluated. Tools to assist the synthesis of particular frameworks, such as template identification, will be developed. A searchable interactive database of hypothetical zeolite frameworks will be openly available online. Users will be able to explore the physical properties of zeolites and to upload molecular shapes to find the best- matched pores. In addition, users who have synthesized a new material will be able to upload a powder diffraction pattern to find the best match, thereby accelerating the structure-solution of unknown materials. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (and filtered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization. This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures.Layperson's abstractZeolites are arguably one of the most useful classes of materials.  Their structures contain crystalline arrays of pores and open channels that are wide enough to allow small molecules such as water and light oil molecules to enter and leave. In addition, their chemical composition allows them to behave as solid acids. Because of these useful properties, zeolites are used extensively in the petrochemical industry, and there is significant effort to synthesize new zeolites with different absorption properties. Currently, the rate of discovery of new zeolites is slow, being done, essentially, through trial and error.This project seeks to accelerate the rate of discovery of new useful zeolites by computer-aided design. Hypothetical useful zeolites will be predicted by mathematical, statistical, and computational methods, and their physical properties will be computed in order to identify the potentially useful ones. This work may well transform zeolite synthesis by allowing useful zeolite structures to be discovered (andfiltered) ahead of synthesis by computer-assisted rationalization.  This will allow synthesis efforts to be more efficiently focused on targeted structures NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will investigate the genetic underpinnings of language development by studying language-related abilities in families of children with autism. Autism is a severe developmental disorder defined by profound impairments in language, as well as social-emotional functioning and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviors. Although evidence supports a role of genetic factors in autism, the identification of susceptibility genes remains an elusive goal. This project will characterize developmental language profiles present among unaffected family members (parents and siblings), which may be linked to the genes involved in autism. To do so, this study capitalizes on an unprecedented opportunity -- the availability of archival childhood language testing records from a large cohort of families with a child with autism. Using these valuable data, the study will characterize language development of parents and siblings longitudinally over the early school-age years, documenting these relatives' developmental pathways of early language functioning that may be related to the genes involved in autism. The study will also collect DNA from individuals with autism and their family members so that their profiles may be applied to genetic studies examining links to specific genetic variants. Finally, this research will examine relatives' current language profiles and address environmental factors that may protect or augment baseline genetic liability. This could reflect gene-environment interactions, which are critical in understanding factors that influence language development. Autism is a major public health concern. Though once considered to be relatively rare, striking new prevalence estimates of 1 in 150 recently prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to declare autism a national public health crisis. Such reports underscore the pressing urgency for determining the cause of this serious disorder. Information obtained from this study will help target genetic research in autism via the study of genes differentially associated with language functioning in families with a child with autism. That is, by examining developmental pathways of early language functioning among relatives, the study aims to identify developmental profiles that may reflect genetic liability to autism and will be used in current and future molecular genetic studies.  In addition, results provide insight into the underpinnings of language development more generally. The study of developmental growth in genetically-based disorders such as autism can provide crucial insights into genetic and environmental processes of healthy development. Findings from this research may therefore provide a foundation for future work on the genetics of language NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Significant progress has been made in exploiting the practical utility of antineutrino detection for nonproliferation purposes, in particular, reactor monitoring, and for geophysics purposes, by mapping the earth's core, crust, and mantle. Despite these remarkable successes, these inter-related communities have had only modest overlap. As a result, the fields of applied and basic antineutrino physics lack an overarching strategy that would allow efficient exploitation of the resources and strengths provided by each stakeholder. This workshop aims to develop the basis for such a strategic alignment of interests between the fundamental and applied antineutrino physics communities. Workshop reporters will summarize the state of the art in current antineutrino detection; technologies and applications, and participants will work intensively to create an environment for collaborative research across the community. Further, participants will examine the practicality of establishing a National Center for Neutrino Study (NCNS) similar in nature to the Space Telescope Science Institute or the Advanced Photon Source. User community members will be invited to participate in the workshop and will be asked to describe their vision of utilizing neutrino detection devices nationally with the intent to integrate their use globally. These visions will be informed by a clear understanding of the prospects and limitations intrinsic in antineutrino physics provided by the US neutrino science community attendees. The importance of this workshop will be to unite disparate groups of multi-disciplinary scientists with shared goals in antineutrino detection research and applications. A goal of the workshop is to develop stronger bonds of communications between these fields. This step is necessary in order to fully understand the various the components of an antineutrino spectrum and identify correctly the sources of the signal NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project develops and implements recent  Fourier continuation alternating direction  (FC-AD) high-performance algorithms for nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDE), validates such solvers via comparisons with experiments and well-known approximations, and applies the resulting methodology to realistic medical configurations. A significant portion of the effort will design strategies to expand significantly the applicability of High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) (an emerging minimally invasive therapy that uses focused ultrasound beams to cause localized destruction of cancer tissue), and to enable design of optimal HIFU therapies for liver, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. In HIFU, an ultrasound source acoustically contacts the patient's skin to produce a high-amplitude ultrasonic field within the body that focuses on (and heats) a target region---thus leading to tumor destruction. The ultrasound propagates within a medium that is highly heterogeneous---most strongly so due to bone---thus affecting heating, which arises, for example, through perfusion by large blood vessels. Optimal HIFU requires a treatment-planning computational tool, which ensures treatment of the targeted zone and minimal impact on the surrounding tissue. Because previous 3D PDE solvers are more expensive, solution of such complex HIFU problems has not been possible. Using alternating directions and a rapidly convergent Fourier series for non-periodic functions, the proposed FC-AD method has provided for the first time high-order unconditionally stable numerics for general 3D domains at a cost that grows only linearly with the size of the spatial discretization; preliminary tests have demonstrated the capability of the FC-AD method to address satisfactorily the types of nonlinear acoustic problems under consideration. This approach will make possible the study of the effect of heterogeneity on field focusing, heat deposition, and ablation properties - enabling highly optimized HIFU treatment.

The hallmark of jammed materials is that they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids.  In addition, many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force chain networks when external forces are applied.   Although the existence of force chains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in physical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been unable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them.  Precise identification and characterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces will likely have a transformative impact in many arenas.  For example, financial and energy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high inefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone.  Also, avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of granular media detrimentally impacts mankind.  In this work, we will apply novel mathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain a quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials. The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to students from underrepresented groups.  We will organize education and recruiting trips to predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black schools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the Southeast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including demonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.  During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and technology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups.  To stimulate further student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so that promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical aspects of our research.

Theinaugural workshop, ``Computational Homology Tools Applied to Jamming and Flow inGranular Materials'' is scheduled for the winter of 2009 NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports research and education in theoretical polymer physics. The research focus addresses the problem of explicit solvent effects on polymer chain conformation. Because the complex structure of a polymer, whether synthetic or biological, depends on the fluid in which it exists, it is necessary to either include the details (e.g atoms in a host liquid) or employ an effective medium approximation adequate to predict polymer chain conformation. The research carried out in this effort   replaces the complex environment by suitably accurate (and more complicated) effective interaction.  The approach feeds into the general field of multiscale modeling, especially in polymeric systems. The domain of validity of the approach and the accuracy of its extensions are primary interests of the research.The center piece research effort develops a detailed theoretical understanding of the coupling between polymer conformation and solvent properties. A simple, yet realistic continuum based interaction-site model is used in which both polymer and solvent are built from  simple-liquid  monomers. The approach  maps the many-body chain-in-solvent problem onto a few-body single-chain problem via the introduction of a set of site-site solvation potentials. This approach fully incorporates the local solvent structure into the solvation potentials.The research evolves from recent work by the PI that (i) establishes the validity of a pair-wise decomposition of the exact many-body solvation potential for a short chain in a simple-liquid solvent and (ii) successfully applies short chain solvation potential results to long-chain systems. These initial results indicated the potential  application to a broad range of systems. The research of this award focuses on the extends the approach to a larger class of interaction potentials and thus more realistic systems, including asymmetric systems in which the polymer and solvent are built from different interaction sites and to systems with molecular (and polymeric) solvents. The effects of solvent on chain conformation and collapse, as well as multi-body correlations, are studied in each of these systems.The activities undertaken have broad impact beyond the specific research problems. This research represents an important step towards the goal of developing a complete theory of polymeric liquids based on the rigorous techniques of liquid state physics. The approach provides a straightforward way to account for solvent effects in polymer systems without having to perform computationally expensive full-solvent simulations. The results of this research are disseminated both through publication in scientific journals and through presentation at local, regional, and national meetings. The research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at the PI's college. Computation and simulation methods taught in the core physics courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work. The undergraduate students who participate in this research benefit by learning state of the art computer simulation techniques and have opportunities to present at scientific meetings. This research continues a track record of mentoring undergraduates as researchers and successfully fostering their advancement to graduate study in science and engineering. NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY:This award supports research and education in theoretical polymer physics. The research focus addresses the problem of predicting the shape of long polymers when dissolved in different solvents. Because the complex structure of a polymer, whether synthetic or biological, depends on the fluid in which it exists, it is necessary to either include the details (e.g thousands of atoms in a host liquid) or employ an approximation  to accurately predict polymer chain conformation. The research carried out in this effort  replaces the complex environment of the host liquid by suitably accurate (and more complicated) set of rules for how the atoms of polymer interact with each other.   The domain of validity of the approach and the accuracy of its extensions are primary interests of the research.The center piece research effort develops a detailed theoretical understanding of the coupling between polymer shape and solvent properties. A simple, yet realistic  model is used in which both polymer and solvent are built from  simple-liquid  pseudo-atoms. The approach  maps the complex polymer-in-solvent problem onto a simpler polymer-only problem.The activities undertaken have broad impact beyond the specific research problems. This topic is of broad importance since the overall properties of dissolved polymers, including polymer solubility, solution viscosity, and  functionality, are intimately linked to the underlying microscopic configuration  of the individual polymer molecules. The results of this research are disseminated both through publication in scientific journals and through presentation at local, regional, and national meetings. The research program has been designed to allow for maximum student participation by dovetailing into the physics curriculum at the PI's college. Computation and simulation methods taught in the core physics courses establish a direct link between classroom learning and this research program and provide students with the tools needed to make meaningful contributions to this work. The undergraduate students who participate in this research benefit by learning state-of-the-art computer simulation techniques and have opportunities to present papers at scientific meetings. This research continues a track record of mentoring undergraduates as researchers and successfully fostering their advancement to graduate study in science and engineering NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A computational database will be investigated for cyber-enabled discovery of spatio-temporal transport and mixing dynamics in geophysical turbulent flows modeled through simulation. It will be possible to identify vortical flow structures and follow them in time to compute conditional flow quantities, thereby, quantifying the dynamical role of these structures. The database provides an efficient extensible framework for formulating and validating hypotheses. It combines the machinery of an imperative model of spatial data retrieval with powerful computational facilities tailored to dynamic representations of irregular time-dependent structures, overcoming limitations of relational databases in handling such data. Broader impacts of this research are in its contributions to the national infrastructure for research and education in Computer Science, Geosciences and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering; it will lead to a computational methodology applicable to any field that involves time-dependent, multi-scale physical phenomena and admits mathematical rules to characterize features that are posited to be dynamically important.Two Ph.D. students will be trained and will work together with collaborators outside their own fields, enabling cross-disciplinary teaching and training. Research results will be integrated into high-performance computing courses and the database will be used as a tool in graduate courses in turbulence and computational fluid dynamics. The software produced by the investigation will be disseminated publicly. The investigators will actively recruit from under-represented groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Error-correcting codes, studied in a branch of science and engineering known as coding theory, safeguard data against the adverse effects of noise and enable reliable storage and communication of information.  Such codes pervade our daily lives, with applications ranging from computer hard-disks and UPS bar-codes to cell phones and the Internet to deep space communication. One of the most fundamental questions in coding theory is the following: What is the largest possible fraction of errors that a code of information rate R can correct? Recent theoretical breakthroughs provide a complete answer to this question, namely that the ultimate error-correction radius of 1-R can be reached (by codes over sufficiently large alphabets). Moreover, it can be reached constructively with polynomial-time list decoding, via codes closely related to Reed-Solomon codes, which are ubiquitous in practice.From a practical standpoint, this promises a factor of two improvement over classical error-correction algorithms that are in widespread use today. While this is extremely encouraging, numerous challenges must be overcome in order to bring the theoretical promise of the recent results to practice. This project, led by a multi-disciplinary team, involves an integrated collection of research activities targeted at progress towards the long term goal of attaining the fundamental limit of error-correction. At the theoretical end, the goals include improving the complexity of the decoding algorithms as one approaches the optimal error-correction radius of 1-R, and devising faster algorithms and heuristics for the key steps involved in algebraic list decoding. The project also studies methods to reap the practical benefits of combining the new codes with soft-decision decoding, putting to use the ample amount of probabilistic symbol reliability estimates often available to decoders. Furthermore, the research lays the groundwork for eventual implementation of such algorithms in high-speed/low-power VLSI, thereby enabling the potential deployment of the new codes in a broad range of communication and storage systems. On the education front, the project provides a stimulating research environment for graduate students, encouraging team-work across university boundaries and collaboration across disciplines (computer science, communication theory, and VLSI design NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CBET-0755632  MillerThe goal of this research is to identify the fundamental mechanisms by which non-equilibrium plasmas promote combustion.  The specific focus is on examining excited species from a non-equilibrium plasma and their roles and energy efficiency in autoignition and flame stabilization.  Effects of various species (atoms, radicals, excited molecules) will be studied separately in a carefully controlled environment by generating the active species in a corona discharge and then injecting them into a fuel-air mixture. Reaction progress will be determined using in-situ gas sampling and laser diagnostics. Recent publications have demonstrated the value of these low-temperature plasmas in promoting ignition and flame propagation of hydrocarbons.  One intriguing observation is that autoignition and flames have occurred for temperatures and stoichiometries that are outside the normal flammability limits for the fuels tested.  However, recent modeling work suggests that the increased radical concentration produced by plasmas is insufficient to produce this effect.   Furthermore, existing studies have not been able to discriminate between the effect of ionic species or excited species in promoting combustion, and excited species have essentially been ignored in traditional hydrocarbon combustion studies.  Finding the true mechanism is the key to effective flame ignition and stabilization not only above but also below the autoignition threshold.  This research combines the low-temperature, pre-ignition expertise of the Combustion and Fuels Research Group at Drexel University and the plasma expertise of the A. J. Drexel Plasma Institute at Drexel University, strengthening the work scientifically and engaging students in the resulting multidisciplinary research activity.  The project will also leverage and take advantage of existing programs at Drexel University for enhancing minority participation at the graduate and undergraduate level, such as IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship), Bridges to the Doctorate, GAANN (Graduate Assistantships in the Areas of National Need), GEM (Graduate Education for Minorities), AMP (Alliance for Minority Participation), and three REU site programs. Introducing combustion, plasma, energy efficiency, and emissions reduction to under-represented minority students will help them to explore and develop their career interest in these fields NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The understanding of cooperative processes in biomolecular systems (such as protein dynamics, folding, and self-assembly) poses outstanding challenges both for theory and experiment. The large number of degrees of freedom involved, and the degree of heterogeneity present, may at a first glance suggest the lack of general principles. As Francis Crick wrote twenty years ago, commenting on macromolecular dynamics,  what seems to physicists a hopelessly complicated process may have been what Nature found simplest . The behavior of a macro-molecular system appears overwhelmingly complicated. Biologically relevant macro-molecular systems are the result of billions of years of evolution, during which details and exceptions have been selected for functional reasons. In spite of the complexity, collective phenomena emerge in macromolecular systems, as for instance in protein folding and self-assembly processes, suggesting the existence of organizing principles that may actually exploit the complexity to obtain simplicity.Is it possible to understand (that is, reproduce, quantify, and predict) how organization emerges from the interactions of the single degrees of freedom in a biomolecular system, over a broad spectrum of length and timescales? Empirical and theoretical evidence supports the idea that for most macromolecular processes only a small portion of the conformational space is visited, and that for medium/long time scales a very small number of parameters are enough to describe the coarse dynamics of a large macromolecular system. Previous work in this direction has not been automatic or systematic, and has been driven mostly by physical intuition, with little or no guarantee of success.It is the goal of this work to develop and apply a radically different approach, that reconciles biological and biochemical approaches with a physical and mathematical perspective. A key step towards the formulation of the general  rules  that evolution has employed for regulating the behavior of biomolecular processes resides in the mathematically rigorous identification and the physically sound interpretation of the minimal set of effective parameters needed to faithful reproduce the macromolecular process of interest. The methods that will be developed to this end are based on multiscale geometric measure theory, harmonic analysis, and dimensionality reduction. The core of these ideas will be widely applicable to the analysis of the geometry of large high dimensional data sets, across and beyond biophysics, leading to novel general paradigms for dimensionality reduction and regression on such data sets NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit. This research addresses challenging issues of organic matter (OM) preservation in marine clay-rich sediment and soils using novel techniques for visualizing three dimensionally OM in nano- and microfabric signatures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This effort will advance the understanding of processes and mechanisms and nano- and microfabric signatures that drive OM preservation at these scales during the very early development of marine sediment. It will provide direct  cutting edge  evidence confirming or refuting concepts and ideas advanced without direct observational evidence by the scientific community concerning OM preservation in marine sediment. It will provide direct visual evidence of protection against enzymatic digestion of OM by clay fabric. Hypotheses to be tested include, (1) pore throats and tortuosity of pores impedes the movement of enzymes through clay fabric and (2) OM is preferentially sorbed onto edges of clay platelets and interstices at the junctures of clay domains. Hypothesis testing entails developing a realistic quantitative three-dimensional visual model of OM protection based on potential enzymatic digestion of specific substrates and direct TEM observations of OM distribution with respect to pores reconstructed from serial sections of sediments representing the globally most important OM depocenter. Clay is inherently electron dense and easily visualized by TEM; visualization of OM will be accomplished with electron dense stains. Smectite and illite clay samples will be studied including field collected fecal pellets from marine polychaetes. This research will advance the development of realistic conceptual models of OM preservation and ultimately organic carbon cycling based on direct visualization of organo-clay relationships and quantitative analysis. The research will also provide quantitative data for advancing (1) understanding of biogeochemical fluxes of organic carbon in marine sediments and (2) the development of emerging models addressing organo-clay preservation dynamics.Broader Impacts. A graduate student from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) will be trained in TEM techniques and image analysis, will participate in writing manuscripts, and in presenting data at regional and national scientific meetings. Training will be offered to science education graduate students in TEM techniques and image analysis during our regular summer teaching program. Undergraduates through the local NSF REU program will assist in TEM work and image analysis and present research at local and regional meetings. The project supports three investigators at two institutions in an EPSCoR state and establishes collaboration among disciplines and institutions with CoPIs from academia and the private sector. Research results will be published in leading international journals as well as local and national professional meetings. A website will be established to make our data and interpretations widely available. This project has broader societal and economic implications by increasing knowledge of OM sequestration during early sediment diagenesis and understanding the development of protokerogen and ultimately kerogen in petroleum source rocks NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Intellectual Merit.

Hypotheses to be tested include, (1) pore throats and tortuosity of pores impedes the movement of enzymes through clay fabric and (2) OM is preferentially sorbed onto edges of clay platelets and interstices at the junctures of clay domains. Hypothesis testing entails developing a realistic quantitative three-dimensional visual model of OM protection based on potential enzymatic digestion of specific substrates and direct TEM observations of OM distribution with respect to pores reconstructed from serial sections of sediments representing the globally most important OM depocenter. Clay is inherently electron dense and easily visualized by TEM; visualization of OM will be accomplished with electron dense stains. Smectite and illite clay samples will be studied including field collected fecal pellets from marine polychaetes. This research will advance the development of realistic conceptual models of OM preservation and ultimately organic carbon cycling based on direct visualization of organo-clay relationships and quantitative analysis. The research will also provide quantitative data for advancing (1) understanding of biogeochemical fluxes of organic carbon in marine sediments and (2) the development of emerging models addressing organo-clay preservation dynamics.Broader Impacts. A graduate student from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) will be trained in TEM techniques and image analysis, will participate in writing manuscripts, and in presenting data at regional and national scientific meetings. Training will be offered to science education graduate students in TEM techniques and image analysis during our regular summer teaching program. Undergraduates through the local NSF REU program will assist in TEM work and image analysis and present research at local and regional meetings. The project supports three investigators at two institutions in an EPSCoR state and establishes collaboration among disciplines and institutions with CoPIs from academia and the private sector. Research results will be published in leading international journals as well as local and national professional meetings. A website will be established to make data and interpretations widely available. This project has broader societal and economic implications by increasing knowledge of OM sequestration during early sediment diagenesis and understanding the development of protokerogen and ultimately kerogen in petroleum source rocks NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The understanding of cooperative processes in biomolecular systems (such as protein dynamics, folding, and self-assembly) poses outstanding challenges both for theory and experiment. The large number of degrees of freedom involved, and the degree of heterogeneity present, may at a first glance suggest the lack of general principles. As Francis Crick wrote twenty years ago, commenting on macromolecular dynamics,  what seems to physicists a hopelessly complicated process may have been what Nature found simplest . The behavior of a macro-molecular system appears overwhelmingly complicated. Biologically relevant macro-molecular systems are the result of billions of years of evolution, during which details and exceptions have been selected for functional reasons. In spite of the complexity, collective phenomena emerge in macromolecular systems, as for instance in protein folding and self-assembly processes, suggesting the existence of organizing principles that may actually exploit the complexity to obtain simplicity.Is it possible to understand (that is, reproduce, quantify, and predict) how organization emerges from the interactions of the single degrees of freedom in a biomolecular system, over a broad spectrum of length and timescales? Empirical and theoretical evidence supports the idea that for most macromolecular processes only a small portion of the conformational space is visited, and that for medium/long time scales a very small number of parameters are enough to describe the coarse dynamics of a large macromolecular system. Previous work in this direction has not been automatic nor systematic, and has been driven mostly by physical intuition, with little or no guarantee of success.It is the goal of this work to develop and apply a radically different approach, that reconciles biological and biochemical approaches with a physical and mathematical perspective. A key step towards the formulation of the general  rules  that evolution has employed for regulating the behavior of biomolecular processes resides in the mathematically rigorous identification and the physically sound macromolecular process of interest. The methods that will be developed to this end are based on multiscale will be widely applicable to the analysis of the geometry of large high dimensional data sets, across and such data sets NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A theoretical research and training program is proposed in the fundamental area of growth of unstable interfaces and related problems, a fast developing area in contemporary research. The growth of an interface is said to be unstable if a smooth initial interface eventually develops a fractal structure.  Under this umbrella one studies important and distinct phenomena such as growth of bacterial colonies and cancer cells, dynamics of chemical reaction, propagation of crystallization fronts, dynamics of the Quantum Hall droplets, transport of 1D fermions, Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), surface instabilities in hydrodynamical flows, Integrable Models, and 2D Quantum Gravity and Matrix Models.  Laplacian Growth (LG) is the simplest nontrivial model of such unstable growth. In LG the velocity of the interface is proportional to the gradient of some scalar field with an additional condition of incompressibility. This scalar field can represent very different physical quantities such as electrostatic field, food concentration, or a pressure field. It is an excellent context in which to study the general phenomena of unstable growth. The proposed project looks beyond current LG formalism to the possibility of using symmetries and the introduction of stochastic noise to the problem, making it more realistic and relevant. It will allow one to: i) consider the selection problem in any geometry of Laplacian Growth as a problem of stability against stochastic noise; ii) introduce new formalisms for the growth more closely connected to experiment; iii) approach the problem of finding the (multi)fractal properties of the interface; iv) formulate the Laplacian Growth as a Hamiltonian problem.Broader impact: 1. LG and DLA are good research area for graduate and undergraduate students to be introduced into nonlinear dynamics, Integrable Models, and other contemporary areas of mathematics and physics.  It will allow a student to see the effects of nonlinear couplings, see the emergence of new fundamental dynamical properties which arise due to stochasticity. The student will gain an experience in interdisciplinary research.  2. The PI and the students will publish in peer reviewed journals and give presentations at conferences. In addition the PI will use every opportunity for media appearances and public lectures to communicate the results to a broader public.  3. The proposed research will contribute to the development of a better understanding of the dynamics of growth of unstable interfaces in all the applications mentioned above.  These areas are of the great importance for the technology, medicine, and environmental studies NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop a suite of tools and services to encourage formation of virtual organizations in scientific communities of various sizes, such as conference groups and departmental research groups, and allow such organizations to filter out relevant documents from various input streams, select and enhance the quality of bibliographic data associated with the organization, and attract researchers to contribute to activity of the organization.  Methods of bibliometric analysis, machine learning and statistical visualization will be applied to assist the exploration and understanding of bibliographic collections of various sizes, for example all work produced by a research group, or published in a journal, or all work in a field.This will provide an interactive environment which allows the researcher to move beyond static summaries to dynamically explore the environment in which an article of interest exists.  In particular, methods of machine-learning will be applied to to build an article recommendation service, based on collaborative filtering and on semantic analysis of bibliographic data, initially for researchers in probability and statistics.  Research will also be done to provide adequate authoring tools for authors in mathematical fields to easily create highly structured, machine-readable documents in latex, bibtex and  or similar formats, which can then be easily aggregated and interlinked in encyclopedic compilations, and then subjected to machine-learning and statistical analysis to provide high-level overviews of the landscape of these fields.In statistics, mathematics and related fields, including social science,  we expect the networks of information about authors, publications, problems and datasets that will be created and exposed through this project should advance these fields by revealing hidden connections among different sub-disciplines, and accelerating the transmission of knowledge across these sub-disciplines.With respect to information science, the project should advance understanding of the collaborative production and enhancement of bibliographic information online, leveraging flexible similarity metrics presented in a visually stimulating way to draw interest and encourage the researcher to expand their search parameters. This proposal addresses three fundamental problems of knowledge management: the compartmentalization problem (how to break down barriers which separate disciplines), the navigation problem (how to guide students and researchers within and between disciplines), and the maintenance problem (how to provide incentives for individuals and organizations to improve the quality of publicly accessible knowledge).It is proposed to solve these problems by gradually distilling the wealth of heterogeneous data now available in digital formats into an openly navigable network of websites, the Bibliographic Knowledge Network (BKN), each node of which is a website dedicated to a specific topic or field of knowledge.  Each participating site will typically be designed as a guide for researchers, teachers, and students in a particular field of knowledge, and maintained by a Virtual Organization with a commitment to that field.The BKN will be created through the development of software which makes it easy for a large collection of mostly small and distributed organizations to brand, select, maintain, and annotate collections of structured scientific content. That content will be made available in machine-readable formats, to allow connections between ideas in different disciplines to be made using methods of machine learning. Methods of machine learning will be applied to provide article recommendation services based on both  collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of documents.The collective knowledge system emerging from this project will be available beyond the walls of academia, and provide well-organized high quality information to anyone with an Internet connection. The expository components of the system will attract people from all backgrounds to pursue scientific careers, and will allow students at all levels to encounter materials which will lead them to higher levels. The system will add great value to other Open Access initiatives, including the system of interoperable digital repositories, Wikipedia, Open Journal Systems, and free academic search services NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER One of the most exciting challenges in contemporary science is uncovering the genetic basis for the origin of uniquely human traits. Humans and other great apes are genetically very similar, yet diverse aspects of human anatomy, physiology, and behavior are markedly distinct. Recent technological developments provide the ability to begin identifying the specific genes that underlie these important trait differences. This project will focus on the evolution of human diet. Dietary traits are particularly interesting because the diet of early human ancestors and modern humans differ so markedly from those of the other great apes and because diet affects so many aspects of human health and disease. An interdisciplinary team of anthropologists and human geneticists will integrate genetic, organismal, and ecological information to better understand the genetic basis for the evolution of dietary traits in humans. The primary intellectual goals of this project are to: (1) screen the human genome for relevant genes using two approaches, measuring gene expression across the entire genome from humans and chimpanzees in several tissues of dietary significance using ultra high-throughput sequencing and testing for adaptation in DNA sequences across the entire genome based on patterns of mutation; (2) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes implicated in trait changes during human origins through extensive DNA sequence comparisons among great ape species, detailed characterization of gene expression, experimental tests of functional differences, and associations between gene expression and specific dietary traits; and (3) conduct integrative case studies of diet-related genes among modern African human populations that are diverse with respect to diet and local climate, through detailed analyses of genetic variation, tests for natural selection, and genetic associations with specific dietary traits. The broader impacts of this research include: collaborations and resource building with African scientists, recruitment and training of women and minority trainees, education outreach to grade school students, building two novel and informative databases that will be easily accessible through the web, and developing software for comparative analysis of primate genome sequences and gene expression NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER People may be unaware of their own important underlying attitudes and beliefs, particularly in the domains of stereotyping and prejudice. Nevertheless, these  implicit biases  significantly influence inter-group behavior in everyday social interactions. Indeed, the influence of these biases often is greater than that of explicitly stated inter-group attitudes and beliefs, affecting important outcomes for members of minority groups. As such, it is critical to understand the nature and operation of implicit bias, as well as the factors that may change them or reduce their influence. To achieve these goals, Dr. Jeffrey Sherman of the University of California - Davis uses mathematical modeling with a tool called the Quad model that he developed in his past research. Application of this tool has shown that implicit attitudes and beliefs sometimes may reflect the automatic activation of biased associations in memory or may reflect failures to regulate the influences of such associations on behavior. The Quad model can be used to estimate the independent roles of each of these factors in producing biased and unbiased behavior. There are four specific goals in this research. First, the Quad model will be applied to shed light on the contextual and individual factors that influence the extent of implicit bias. Implicit bias has been shown to vary significantly across social contexts and across individuals, often reflecting personal goals and motives. This research will model contextual and individual differences in implicit bias in order to better understand the factors that increase or decrease the automatic activation of biased associations and the ability to regulate the expression of those associations. The second goal is to apply a  treatment  approach to reducing implicit bias. In these studies, interventions that are designed specifically to influence either underlying associations or the ability to regulate those associations will be applied to individuals and contexts associated with enhanced activation of associations or diminished ability to self-regulate. The goal is to show how interventions can be tailored to address specific deficits in processing (over-activation of associations vs. failure of regulation) associated with increases in implicit bias. The third goal is to use the Quad model to better understand the relationships among different measures of stereotyping and prejudice, which frequently fail to correspond to one another. The present research proposes that dissociations among these different measures may reflect differences in the extents to which the measures reflect the automatic activation of associations versus the failure to regulate the associations. Application of the model will help to specify when and why different measures will and will not produce corresponding results. Finally, the fourth goal is to use the Quad model to better predict behavior in inter-group settings. Measures of stereotyping and prejudice are sometimes poor predictors of people's actual behavior towards members of minority groups. The Quad model can improve the ability of these measures to predict behavior by independently assessing the roles of automatic associations, the ability to regulate those associations, and interactions between these components. In sum, the purpose of this research is to improve the measurement of stereotyping and prejudice, increase understanding of the factors that increase or decrease such biases, and improve the ability of measures of bias to predict people's behavior.  Implicit attitudes influence behavior in important domains of life including law enforcement, health, and employment.  It is therefore critical to gain a better understanding of their nature and operation NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Southern University at Shreveport (SUSLA) requested support for an HBCU-UP implementation award aimed at supporting the institutional mission of SUSLA:  to provide a quality education for its students, while being committed to the total community?.  Southern University at Shreveport, Louisiana, is a two year institution with a student body enrollment of approximately 2,400, predominantly African American (90%) and predominantly female (76%).  The HBCU-UP project is designed to strengthen STEM teaching and research to improve retention of undergraduates and strengthen their academic preparation.  Strategies include:  i) Course and curriculum reform and enhancement through the incorporation of advances in science and engineering knowledge and research based teaching and learning; ii) faculty professional development; iii) supervised research and active learning experiences for STEM undergraduates in research laboratories and other institutions during the summer; iv) infusion of technology into research and teaching; and v) critical transition activities for student recruitment and retention in STEM disciplines.Course and curricular reform will focus on gate-keeper courses.  The revisions will enhance entry-level lab/research exercises, supported by updated equipment and teaching activities.  In addition, through the HBCU-UP project, SUSLA will obtain technology resources to be used to update and enhance the teaching methodology.  The courses impacted will include biology, chemistry, computer science, electronics technology and mathematics.Faculty support will include release time for mentoring of students, support for research and support for participation in scientific meetings.This project will benefit from strong partnerships aimed at enriching the research experiences for the undergraduate students.  SUSLA has partnerships with other academic institutions and private companies, through which students will receive research training, a new activity at this two-year institution.  Partnerships with secondary schools will strengthen recruitment efforts through a summer research program for high school students.Underlying the strategies presented is the focus on high school to undergraduate transition, and associate-baccalaureate-graduate school transitions.  The activities aimed at these transition points will be implemented through partnerships with other funded programs, including the LS AMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) and the LSAMP Bridges programs, also funded by the National Science Foundation NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER In 2001, Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was established with the support of the National Science Foundation.  TESS is an infrastructure project that capitalizes on economies of scale to enable scholars from across the social sciences, on a competitive basis, to conduct ground-breaking research on issues of broad theoretical and practical importance.  Since its inception, TESS has enabled an unprecedented number of researchers to collect original, high quality nationally-representative experimental data. On a continuous basis, TESS solicits proposals to test methodological and substantive hypotheses from across the social sciences, submits them to a rigorous peer review process, and then implements the most innovative and promising experiments on its Internet-based data collection platform. This platform draws on national probability samples of respondents and offers the capability for implementing complex experimental designs. The key to TESS is multiple studies, from different disciplines, sharing a common observational platform, all exploiting the inferential power of experimental designs and nationally representative samples. By distributing the costs of sampling, data collection, and data management over a large number of studies, TESS dramatically reduces the average cost of each study and makes experimentation on general-population samples available to researchers for whom the obstacles to such work would be otherwise prohibitive. As a scientific investment, therefore, TESS offers broad, immediate, and long-lasting benefits. At the same time, many of its costs are remarkably low. Viewed as a whole, TESS breaks new ground by following the best scientific practice of the past ? it harnesses cutting edge technology and uses it to create and disseminate new discoveries about critical social and behavioral phenomena. Indeed, while TESS has innovated in many ways, its basic strategy is to follow a path that has served science well in the past ? make the best technology available to our best scientific minds.The broader impacts of TESS are substantial.  Most obviously, TESS enhances the infrastructure for research and education, providing a common platform for the conduct and analysis of general population experiments.  In so doing, TESS advances discovery and understanding by capitalizing on economies of scale to make general population experiments feasible to a diverse array of talented, innovative social scientists, most of whom would otherwise be unable to conduct such research.  TESS also promotes teaching, training, and learning at the undergraduate and graduate levels in a number of ways.  For example, graduate students from across the social sciences are encouraged to submit TESS proposals, and expert reviewers provide detailed feedback.  Graduate students (and even a handful of undergraduates) have been PIs or co-PIs on a number of successful TESS proposals, and have benefited from the experience of running their own population-based experiment.  In addition, graduate students and undergraduates have benefited from the incorporation of TESS data into courses on research methods and statistics across the country, providing young scholars with manageable experimental data sets on which to develop their analytic skills. And graduate and undergraduate students will serve as Research Assistants, gaining hands-on experience in all aspects of TESS .  TESS also broadens the participation of underrepresented groups, both as investigators and research participants.  At the heart of TESS? mission is the democratization of access to high quality, original experimental data, putting the power of population-based experiments in the hands of researchers from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, from all types of academic institutions, and from all stages of career.  And because the TESS data collection platform involves a representative sample, the results of TESS projects reflect the broad diversity of our nation.  Further, the data collection platform enables investigators to oversample respondents from otherwise underrepresented groups, and a number of TESS projects have done so for the express purpose of better understanding psychological, behavioral, or economic processes within these groups NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0417413GA Tech Research Corp - GA Institute of TechnologyManolios CRCD/EI: Integrating Functional Computer-Aided Reasoning into the Computer Science Curriculum This project involves the development of tools, courses, modules, and self-paced online materials that integrate computer-aided reasoning into the Computer Science (CS) curriculum. This project is novel in undergraduate CS education. The use of a state-of-the-art theorem proving technology (ACL2) permits students to get instant, reliable feedback, thereby enabling effective learning and self-paced study. ACL2 is a tool consisting of a functional programming language, a logic, and a theorem-prover, that has been used to prove some of the largest and most complicated theorems ever proved about commercially designed systems. The project involves at least two research challenges: taking a necessarily complex, state-of-the-art, theorem proving system and teaching undergraduates how to be effective users in a portion of a semester, and developing effective courses in other areas, such as hardware design and object oriented programming, that are based on the use of computer-aided reasoning. A sequence of mathematical concepts and mechanical tools, with well-designed graphical user-interfaces, allow students to gradually and seamlessly master ACL2. Integration of computer-aided reasoning into current curricula is accomplished through two courses that make essential use of these tools, thereby giving students a deeper and more complete understanding of the material. The courses cover the following topics: computer organization and design, object-oriented programming using the JVM, theorem proving, and formal methods. One of the undergraduate courses focuses on computer organization and design and the other on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In these two courses, computer-aided reasoning is used to give students a deeper understanding of the material. They are required to think about the properties systems and components under consideration should enjoy and how to prove that these properties do in fact hold NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER To sustainably meet the simultaneous and growing demands for water, energy, and environmental quality while protecting the welfare and tradition of affected communities, a broader view of dams is needed.  To address this need, this interdisciplinary research project will apply a new tool for evaluating the relative costs and benefits of dam construction based on multi-objective planning techniques. The Integrative Dam Assessment Modeling (IDAM) tool is designed to integrate biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical perspectives into a single cost/benefit analysis of dam construction.  Each of 27 different impacts of dam construction will be evaluated both objectively (e.g., flood protection) and subjectively (i.e., the valuation of said flood protection) by a team of decision makers.  By providing a visual representation of the costs and benefits associated with two or more dams, the IDAM tool will allow decision makers to evaluate alternatives and to articulate priorities associated with a dam project, making the decision process more informed and more transparent.  The IDAM tool will be an evolutionary step in dam evaluation.  Coupled with event chronologies and hotspot mapping of conflicts, household surveys, public-participatory geographic information systems, and hydrologic modeling, the proposed process will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding the assessment, minimization, and distribution of hydropower impacts across cultural and organizational levels and to engage stakeholders in the design process through a decision theater.Significant intellectual contributions of this project will include the use of a uniquely multidisciplinary, integrative model to understand the effects of dams through a controlled study of a complex social and environmental system in China.  The project will make several pragmatic contributions related to policy and decision making through disciplinary and interdisciplinary investigation.  The project therefore will increase understanding about the interplay of multiple impacts of dam construction in a variety of geographic contexts.  Because this collaborative effort will includes opportunities for research in undergraduate institutions, this project will support high-quality research by faculty members at two undergraduate institutions and encourage the integration of research and education.  Substantial coordination and capacity building will occur across organizations, levels of experience, and disciplines.  A broad dissemination strategy is aimed at strengthening research, teaching, and public outreach about society environment interactions in the U.S., Asia, and elsewhere.  Finally, this decision-support process will yield both new knowledge and accessible tools for improving institutions' ability to manage the social and environmental dynamics associated with dams as agents of change.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Quasi-states are secessionist regions that have established internal territorial sovereignty but lack widespread recognition and legitimacy as states. Despite their tenuous and contested status, such regions have long been features of world political maps. A U.S-Russian research team will focus on four quasi-states in the Balkans-Black Sea region - Kosovo, Transdniester Moldovan Republic (TMR) in Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia.  These sites were chosen because of research access, contrasting historical experiences, sources of dispute between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community, and the varied implementation of international norms of refugee protection and recognition of self-determination. Two fundamental research and policy concerns are raised by quasi-states. First, how and why do certain quasi-states endure and, second, why are some more successful at accumulating legitimacy than others?The contested declaration of independence by Kosovo in early 2008 and concern about a precedent effect render these questions particularly timely. The establishment of internal and external legitimacy in the wake of wars that defined the political unit is a key factor in accounting for the robustness of quasi-states. The specific research questions include: a) What is the character and localized distribution of the agricultural, industrial, trade, social and political dynamics of the unrecognized quasi-states? b) What factors (war experience, governance structure, nation-building and identity construction, migration or displacement, border relations and international control) helps explain these distributions? c) How do state-aspirant elites work across a variety of scales to promote legitimacy, in the wake of the Kosovo precedent? d) How appropriate is it to make comparisons between these 4 cases? e) How does the enduring of quasi-states affect global norms concerning ethnic cleansing and violence?To overcome potential difficulties in accessibility and reliability, a multi-methods data gathering approach has been adopted to examine the internal legitimacy of quasi-states across a variety of scales. This includes public opinion sampling of about 1000 persons in each study site (among both residents of the quasi-states and the displaced populations), focus group discussions (including about 400 persons in all) and elite interviews. Public and unpublished statistical data are also analyzed in a geographical information system, incorporating land cover change derived from repeat Landsat satellite imagery over the past 20 years.The four frozen conflicts are outcomes of civil wars in the 1990s that were  characterized by ethnic cleansing, destruction of infrastructure, and deteriorating relations between the countries from which the secessionist quasi-states splintered and external supporters (Russia in three of the cases).   The quasi-states themselves are often marked as grey zones of smuggling (especially drugs and weapons), money laundering, border violations, transit points of terrorists, and refuges of criminals beyond the reach of international law. Without more information about the conditions inside the quasi-states (level of legitimacy with their own populations, the extent and nature of their contacts with the supporting countries, the willingness of the populations to accept territorial compromises or other settlement options, the level of inter-ethnic distrust, and border controls), policy formation and implementation is significantly removed from  facts on the ground NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The goal of this project is to address a series of interesting open problems in mathematical analysis relating to the Radon transform and its generalizations.  These problems include determining the boundedness of certain multilinear functionals (nonlinear analogues of the Holder-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities) on products of Lebesgue spaces, as well as the understanding of the regularity of averaging operators (in both the standard and overdetermined cases) on Lebesgue and Lebesgue square integrable Sobolev spaces.Radon transforms and their generalizations are intimately connected to some of the greatest outstanding problems in modern analysis, including the Kakeya conjecture, the Bochner-Riesz conjecture, the Restriction conjecture, and Sogge?s local smoothing conjecture.  The intellectual merit of the particular problems to be studied in this project is that their solutions require significant new theoretical insight, and they are potentially significant steps on the road to solution of some of these broader outstanding problems.A better understanding the Radon transform and its generalizations also may have broader impacts on other fields within the scientific community. Medical imaging, including CT and SPECT scans, NMR imaging, RADAR, and SONAR applications all depend on a deep theoretical and practical understanding of the Radon transform. Optical-acoustic tomography, scattering theory, and even motion-detection algorithms also depend on the Radon transform. All of these fields and more could potentially benefit from insights produced by this project NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project focuses on the functional implications of low-frequency rhythms in the basal ganglia and neocortex.  The collaborative effort involves four groups: Kopell, (Boston University), Moore (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Graybiel (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Boyden (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  The project is the first collaborative research effort of the newly formed Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC), a group of Boston Area faculty members from Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Brandeis University and Tufts University.  The aims of the CRC, which fosters research and training, are to map the spatio-temporal structure of brain dynamics and connect these dynamics to brain function.  This is the first project to try to understand from basic electrophysiology the growing literature suggesting that the low frequency brain rhythms are critical for both attention and learning, and that interactions among brain structures such as the basal ganglia and neocortex are central for such functions.  The project makes use of the electrophysiology skills of the Graybiel lab, which is focused on the dynamics of the basal ganglia, and those of the Moore lab, focused on the neocortex, to understand the flow of information between the cortex and the basal ganglia during learning and attention.  This collaboration is enriched by new molecular biology technology developed by the Boyden group.  This technology, in which cells can be activated and inactivated by light, provides powerful new techniques for figuring out circuits by looking at effects of perturbations, even in behaving animals. The experimental work is guided by modeling ideas from the Kopell and Moore labs, and the output of the modeling can be tested almost immediately by the labs for quick feedback and changes.  This CRC project exemplifies a new and transformational way of doing science, bridging the boundaries of disciplines and institutes to facilitate cutting edge research at the forefront of interdisciplinary endeavors NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Status and stigma are fundamental factors that influence the ways that individuals organize themselves in social groups. Status is a social process whereby persons in groups locate themselves and others in hierarchies of influence and prestige. Stigma is a process whereby members of social groups identify certain attributes as discrediting, subjecting those who possess them to social rejection and exclusion. Research on status processes in groups has identified a number of attributes that act as status markers, including gender, race, age, and education. Research on stigma processes has also identified a number of attributes that are stigmatizing, including mental illness and physical disability. The research literatures on stigma and status have both proliferated in recent decades, but they have operated more or less independently. Mental illness and physical disability, for example, are absent from research on status processes in groups. Research on stigma, in turn, does not typically attend to status-related outcomes such as influence and performance evaluations. The investigators will carry out three studies that address areas of convergence and departure between status and stigma processes in groups.The first study is an experiment to be completed at the University of Maryland to investigate responses to an attribute identified in prior research as a status marker (educational attainment), attributes identified as stigmatizing (various categories of mental illness), and an attribute identified in research as both a marker of status and stigma (race) in order to determine ways in which reactions to the attributes overlap and diverge. The second project, to be completed at Columbia University, is a study of implicit attitudes toward persons with mental illness. Unlike self-report measures of attitudes that require the attention and control of individuals, the expression of implicit attitudes is spontaneous and unintentional. The major advantage of implicit measures is that they have the capacity to overcome social desirability biases that are common in other types of attitude measures. The third project is an audit study to test for status- and stigma-related outcomes of mental illness in employment decisions. The study involves sending job applications to employment listings, varying whether the applications specify a history of mental illness.By employing multiple methodological approaches as well as variables and measures that represent both traditions, the three studies have the potential to significantly push forward the independent research literatures on both status and stigma processes in groups. The studies also have the capacity to inform intervention programs designed to reduce the stigma of mental illness. Although there have been several recent calls for interventions to reduce the stigma of mental illness, most of these interventions have not included a research component. Because the interventions with the highest likelihood of success will be grounded in basic research, and because poorly grounded interventions may result in wasted resources and pessimism about our ability to reduce stigma, the proposed studies represent an important complement to more applied approaches to eradicate the stigma of mental illness NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The inclusion of Muslim immigrant communities is arguably the most demanding political challenge facing liberal democracies in Western Europe. A large research literature has addressed one dimension of this challenge -- the rise of radical right parties (e.g., Stubager 2008; Green-Pederson and Odmalm 2008; Bjørklund and Andersen; Togeby 1998).  An emerging literature is documenting another dimension - the conflict of cultural norms (e.g., Sniderman and Hagendoorn 2007). This project explores potentially the deepest strain of all - between the norms of liberal democracy on the one side and the requirements of religious inclusion on the other. The Danish  Cartoon Crisis  is one of the most dramatic examples of the strain between the values of liberal democracy and the honor of the Muslim faith. Denmark is accordingly the focus of this study. But its findings have broad relevance to liberal democracies in Western Europe. This exploratory study focuses on two questions. First, does an intense clash over colliding values increase popular intolerance toward Muslim immigrants? Second, is popular opinion responsive to elite interventions in support of democratic values? The answers to these to questions will help illuminate the scope of choices open to political leaders during moments of crisis. If the answer to the first question is no, and the answer to the second yes, political elites have room to chose policies that are experimental and inclusive. If the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is no, political elites have less room to maneuver and will be under, at least in the short run pressure to adopt  tough on Muslim  policies -- for example, making the standards to acquire citizenship more demanding. For its empirical base, this study relies on three separate - but temporally overlapping - surveys of the general public conducted under the direction of Professor Lise Togeby. This set of partly overlapping surveys provides a unique record of public reactions spanning two distinct intervals -- when the Cartoon Crisis was in the forefront of public attention and when it had receded into the background. The surveys also include randomized experiments that both replicate previous research and extend it in innovative ways NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THIS REQUIREMENT IS DESCRIBED AS THE  MINIATURIZATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE FOR REMOTE PLANETARY STUDIES .  THIS EFFORT WILL PROVIDE LUNAR REGOLITH/SOIL ''GROUND TRUTH'' KNOWLEDGE FOR EXPERIMENTS, PERFORM SIZE SEPARATIONS OF APO NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Significance and importance of the project.  The initiation of earthquakes on faults in the Earth?s crust is controlled, incredibly, by physical processes that occur at microscopic contacts between rough surfaces of rock that touch along the fault.  Despite the success of empirical friction equations in describing the results of laboratory friction experiments and producing a variety of earthquake-related phenomena in computer models of earthquakes, these equations lack a physical basis.  That is, the precise identity and nature of the physical mechanisms that  occur at microscopic contacts, and give rise to the observed friction effects in experiments, remain unknown.  The empirical nature of the descriptions reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying the physical processes at microscopic fault contacts.  Without a sound physical understanding, we remain limited in our abilities to reliably apply the equations to earthquakes in nature, to obtain a better general understanding of the earthquake process, and to ultimately make reliable predictions of earthquakes.  In this transformative study, we will make use of state-of-the-art materials science testing methods, namely atomic force microscopy and Nanoindentation, to provide a physical basis for friction observations at a coarser scale and thereby gain a much improved understanding of the earthquake process.  This work may allow us to learn whether we are likely to be able to detect accelerating creep on faults just prior to an earthquake and thereby predict earthquakes days to hours before an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to the built environment.  From the perspective of the scientific fields of mechanics and materials science, these new insights, gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales, have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. Technical description. The overarching goals of the proposed studies are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at asperity contacts at frictional interfaces.  A more specific major goal of our study is to understand the origin of the friction state ?evolution? effect in rate and state friction, the simplest manifestation of which is an increase in ?static? friction with the time of quasi-stationary contact.  To that end, we will conduct a coordinated, interdisciplinary collaboration that will employ laboratory experiments that investigate frictional phenomena over a wide range of length scales. One outcome will be to develop constitutive equations that will allow extrapolation of these mechanisms to the elevated temperatures and longer times relevant for earthquakes. We will perform macro-scale friction experiments on rocks at Brown University, micro-scale to nano-scale indentation creep, adhesion, and friction experiments in the Nanoindenters at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and nano-scale adhesion and friction experiments in atomic force microscopes at the University of Pennsylvania. To make connections between the different types of experiments and to isolate different origins of the state evolution effect, we will vary the same environmental conditions in all three sets of experiments. These include tests as a function of humidity, pH (in liquid), and temperature. All three environmental factors have been demonstrated to influence the evolution effect in macroscopic rock friction experiments. Nanoindentation and AFM measurements should allow us to determine the processes on an asperity scale responsible for the macroscopic behavior NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER TERC and the Girl Scouts of America are partnering to create an energy monitoring and conservation after school program for approximately 5,500 girls ages 8-11 in eastern Massachusetts. The goals of the Girls Energy Conservation Corps (GECCo) after school project are to involve girls in learning and applying science, using technology, developing leadership and communication skills, educating peers, saving energy, and addressing the global issue of climate change. The project is (1) developing activity-based Energy Detective Kits to help girls understand, monitor, and reduce energy use, (2) adapting devices for measuring home electricity consumption, and (3) developing guidelines for using new media (such as YouTube) to engage girls in science and helping them use new media to inform and communicate their experiences and findings to Girl Scouts nationally. Project participants are cumulatively reducing their energy consumption and adopting more sustainable lifestyles NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project has four key focus areas which are designed to provide opportunities for student learning, retention and success. The Outreach component targets the K-12 system to foster science exploration and success with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of students choosing STEM science careers. At the college level, the project will increase enrollment of STEM science majors through the development of new courses and programs. For retention of STEM students, the project will foster increased opportunities for student success.  To increase completion/transfer/four year graduation rates, TMCC will initiate partnerships with four year schools to upgrade its curricula, initiate joint research and aid students in developing familiarity with four year schools. The project will conduct an in-depth review and revision of the existing TMCC science courses.  This effort meets two critical needs: enhancing student learning by providing more hands-on activities and ensuring the curricula is consistent with the standards at four year schools.  In the latter area, the project will foster partnerships between the college and four year colleges.  These partnerships are expected to bridge the rural isolation experienced by the TMCC faculty and provide four year school familiarity to students prior to transfer.  As this project is the demonstration of how involvement in learning impacts student achievement and career choices, it is applicable not only in STEM subjects but across the curriculum.  The current literature suggests student learning is heavily impacted by how engaged the student is in the learning process.  Using a results driven approach, the project will identify what enhancements positively impact student learning not only at the college level, but across the continuum of education.  The results of this project can be replicated not only at the college level but in K-12 Native American programs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Whereas all nations are exposed to the same dominant scientific consensus established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, their reactions to this knowledge are highly variable.  National stances toward global climate change cannot be explained by levels of prosperity or immediate vulnerability to disaster.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine the key sociopolitical variables that affect how national polities react to scientific knowledge.  Multiple constituencies form networks of action that effect national policies.  Countries vary in the extent to which leaders of government, non-governmental organizations, businesses, and other influential actors take the scientific claims seriously, assigning high levels of risk and urgency to the problem and developing countermeasures.  Advocacy coalitions for and against remedial action vary in strength in each national context.  Their beliefs, activities, and effectiveness reflect concepts of organizational and national interest and cultural receptiveness to scientific reasoning.  Domestic scientific establishments vary in their capacity to certify climate science claims and diffuse this knowledge.  Among these multiple groups, opportunities for cross-stakeholder participation and dialogue will strengthen national agreement, empower authorities, and lead to more effective national countermeasures.  This project will compare the climate change policy-formation processes of developed (Japan, the United States, Germany, and Sweden), transitional (Russia), and developing countries (India, China, and Brazil) as well as at the international level.  Policy network analysis will be used to study these relational processes.  Comparable surveys in each country will collect data on networks of negotiation, communication, and support among pertinent domestic and international organizations as well as organizational beliefs, goals, resources and policy engagement.  Data collection will take place in 2009-2010 at the height of international negotiations over the post-Kyoto global climate change regime.This project will contribute significantly to knowledge about climate change politics and decision making while also strengthening climate change educational capacity in all the countries, especially in the developing and transition countries.  Women lead four of the nine case research teams, which include multiple ethnic/racial groups and will strive for inclusion of national minorities.  Each team will establish a national center for sociopolitical research, education, training, and public information on climate change.  The teams and centers will form an enduring global network and scientific community, holding regular conferences and workshops and issuing reports and publications.  The project plans repeated surveys at regular intervals.  The resulting public data base will provide an invaluable record of changing national and international reactions to global climate change for future scholarly research.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project will develop new methodologies for understanding hurricane evacuations by integrating behavioral modeling of household decision making with dynamic transportation modeling. By understanding evacuation decision making, the research will contribute to improving the efficiency of hurricane evacuation.This project will develop novel modeling approaches to: (1) Estimate the social, demographic and cultural characteristics that influence household evacuation decision making from surveys of Miami-Dade County residents; (2) Understand how people synthesize evacuation warnings up to the time they make the decision to evacuate;(3) Assess the influence of household decisions based on spatial location; (4) Estimate the temporal variation of evacuees from the time of warning; (5) Determine the optimal time of departure, optimal route and destination choice based on the temporal demand patterns; (6) Incorporate behavioral rules obtained from social science analysis to simulate the transportation system impacts; and (7) Identify ways to distribute the obtained results from multiple hurricane scenarios to stakeholders.The project will use multidisciplinary approaches to understand hurricane evacuation by bringing together approaches from social science, network optimization, agent-based modeling, transportation operations, stochastic optimization and hurricane emergency response NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Anger biases perceptions of risk, which can fundamentally shape leaders? most critical decisions. In one early experiment, the PI found that individuals who felt angry tended to engage in riskier behaviors than did individuals in a neutral emotional state. Having discovered this connection between risk-taking behavior and anger, the PI will explore the effect more deeply by comparing the behavior of participants from the general population to those of elite leaders.The large, diverse sample of high-level decision makers - representing governments, militaries, non-governmental organizations, and corporations will participate in a series of programmatic experiments. Simultaneously collecting biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional data will allow the research team to draw implications for real-world behavior. the team will examine whether anger triggers optimistic responses even when real behavior is measured, real money is at stake, and angry people are compared to those in a neutral state. The PI will also interview our leader-participants to learn about their decision making in a less structured format.As an example, one of the planned experiments will examine the degree to which leaders adhere to long-term goals and strategies rather than being distracted by presently salient information. Specifically, the PI will study whether and how anger and accountability affect the tendency to focus too many resources on an immediate, temporary solution at the cost of a long-term, permanent gain. She predicts that angry participants, as compared to neutral participants, will focus so much on winning battles that they will ultimately lose the war. She also predicts that angry participants who are accountable only for their end result will take a more long-term strategy than those accountable for short-term decisions, while angry participants who have no accountability will fall in the middle. The results will be used to educate leaders and the public about how anger may affect their most risky and important decisions NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The primary goal of this collaborative proposal is to developtheoretically based algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers for Hermitian(and, where possible, non-Hermitian) positive-definite problems.  Theteam aims to improve understanding of the performance of the family ofAMG algorithms and, with this improved knowledge, to develop AMGmethods that offer provable, computable, a priori information on thealgorithm's performance.  The project team represents a closecollaboration of experts in this area, each of whom has madecontributions in the field.  Over the past several years, the team hasbegun to work collectively on developing new multilevel solvers andrigorous theoretical results for the convergence and complexityanalysis thereof.  Together, the team will have the capability to takea step toward answering some of the fundamental research questionsassociated with these two essential aspects of the analysis and designof efficient algorithms.We expect the work proposed here to: (1) directly impact computationalsimulation codes currently employing multi-level solvers, by providingfaster and more reliable computational tools for the numericalcomputations at the core of physical simulations; and (2) allow forsimulation of phenomena for which suitable solvers are currentlyunavailable.  The results from the proposed research will, thus, havea direct impact on scientific and engineering problems, includingthose from energy, through both the simulation of particle physics andprocessing of data from oil reservoir models, biophysics, in surgicalsimulation, and the environment, in climate prediction and contaminantremediation models.  The algorithms to be investigated here arealready in use in many of these fields, but are often considered to be expert-only  tools.  The goal of this proposal is to develop morereliable and robust versions of these tools.  The proposed researchwill have a strong educational impact as well, as it provides for asolid base for training of graduate students in the modern theoreticaland practical aspects of numerical methods for modeling ofapplications arising in science and engineering NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI, lead institution), the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Boston University (BU) are jointly proposing to establish an Engineering Research Center for Smart Lighting under the direction of Fred Schubert, Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering.The integrated research, education, and technology transfer of the Smart Lighting ERC will demonstrate revolutionary lighting systems for rapid diagnostic bio-imaging, high-efficiency displays, safer transportation, and novel modes of communication. The critical enabler for advanced lighting systems will be a new generation of smart light sources whose spectral composition, color temperature, polarization, spatial, and temporal modulation properties are fully controllable and tunable. Smart light sourcesand advanced lighting systems will result in tremendous benefits to society and humankind, including: Fundamental advances in biotechnology for rapid and highly specific identification of cells. Brilliant displays with high efficiency and large color gamut enabled by polarized emitters.Increased safety in transportation systems through the implementation of ambient intelligence. Novel modes of communication, networking, and sensing.Reduced pollution and global warming through energy-conserving, mercury-free lighting.Reduced dependency on sleep-inducing pharmaceuticals, reduced risk of cancer, and support of the natural circadian rhythm, thereby enabling higher productivity and a better quality of life.These benefits will be realized through the systematic exploration and development of smart-lighting principles in three vertically integrated research thrusts: (1) novel materials, (2) device technology, and(3) system applications and impacts. As envisioned, the center will create a unique and focused program in which faculty and students from a wide range of disciplines come together with industry, government, and non-government agencies to work toward the following objectives: Conduct fundamental research to develop Smart Lighting. A strategic analysis has identified the critical attributes of future controllable light sources, and their underlying materials technology necessary to enable new and revolutionary functionalities that go far beyond present capabilities. At the device level,these attributes include polarization control, novel low- and high-index nanostructured materials, nanoepitaxial methods, photonic crystals, and novel types of phosphor distributions. These core innovations will be integrated into working devices and systems that are adaptable, controllable, and manufacturable. Testbed systems that use the devices will demonstrate advances in biomedical, display, transportation, and network communication technologies. Establish a multi-faceted, cross-disciplinary education and training program in Smart Lighting for students and professionals. The hands-on special education program Science You Can See, to be integrated with ERC educational materials, will increase the interest of a broad and minority-rich pre-college and undergraduate audience in science and engineering. Rapidly transfer knowledge to the commercial sector and commercialize validated products. This will be achieved by working side-by-side with established firms and small startup companies in the concept,development, and validation stages of smart-lighting products. Providing industry with rapid access to key results while aggressively pursuing knowledge transfer and securing intellectual property. Increase diversity through a focused effort to attract, educate, and advance women and underrepresented and disadvantaged minorities within the ERC pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate programs, and, ultimately, enable successful careers in Smart Lighting and related industries.Intellectual Merit: The ERC will establish a world-class program in Smart Lighting that will dominate scientific discovery and technological innovation in a new area of photonics. Research and education programs will lead to revolutionary advances in fields as diverse as biotechnology, display, transportation, and networked communications technologies.Broader Impact: The ERC, through rapid commercialization, interactive education programs, and diversity outreach programs, will increase the competitiveness of US industry and make Smart Lighting productsand benefits available worldwide. Additional key participation will come from strategic, corporate, and foreign academic partners. Training programs on entrepreneurship, intellectual property, marketing, and unintended consequences will create a culture of innovation and broaden the scope of research NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This Career award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Florida State University investigates the self-assembly of cholesterol and polyunsaturated lipids in the lipid bilayer and their structural effects on the cell membrane. This proposal is to develop understanding of the fundamental physics behind the cell membrane, and will undoubtedly lead to new medical technologies in the future. In addition, self-assembled biological structures can be tailored to a variety of applications for templating and the formation of nanostructures. This proposal focuses on the study of membrane systems using grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) and resonant x-ray diffraction. Using in-vitro lipid mixtures, the PI will investigate the effects of biologically active molecules on the structure and physical properties of the lipid bilayer. Cholesterol is one of the most important components of the cell membrane, and through interactions with other lipids, it may influence membrane protein function significantly by affecting membrane properties or by inducing phase separation into lipid 'rafts'; areas of the cell membrane with a differing composition to the surrounding regions.  In this project, polyunsaturated fatty acids will be incorporated into biologically relevant lipid bilayers and their interactions with cholesterol. This interplay is highly relevant to membrane properties in the retinal rod cell outer segment, where high concentrations of highly unsaturated lipids occur, but their functions are not well understood. To carry out this work, the investigators will use synchrotron x-ray techniques to study bilayer structure in different lipid mixtures, particularly in plane ordering.  Fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy will complement this work, giving information on macroscopic membrane structure and phase separation. Despite the importance of biological physics and the relevance of cellular structure to the living organism, undergraduate life-science students remain largely unaware of the physics of bio-molecules and their interactions on the nano-scale, where fundamental forces control the assembly of all supra-molecular structures found in the cell. This proposal aims to introduce students in life-science majors with an aversion to physics, to the world of bio-molecular interactions and their importance. By developing a major new course,  Biomedical Physics , the PI is working to introduce physical science topics to the undergraduate student population in novel, biologically related ways.  A key focus is to attract female undergraduate students in life science majors to experience research in physics and to encourage them to pursue a career in biophysics. The PI will also teach an undergraduate course in condensed matter physics that includes more advanced topics in biomolecular assembly and soft matter to the traditional condensed matter topics. These courses will be complemented by the development of a major new web-site  softmatterworld.org  focusing on soft-matter physics, a significant proportion of which will involve biophysics and bio-molecular self-assembly NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The core of this project is the setting up of a research network, initially between four researchers, in three institutions, supporting interchange between them (Robert Adler, Technion, Jonathan Taylor, Stanford, Shmuel Weinberger and Keith Worsley,  Chicago) and, more importantly, their students. They will study problems related to the geometric characterization of random structures, such as topological invariants of excursion (nodal) sets of random fields and learning the homotopy and  homeomorphism types of manifolds in the presence of noise and developing techniques for quantifying the statistical accuracy of  the resulting estimates. Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing  non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications  natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is  non-Riemannian.The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey. The four PIs come from a variety  of intellectual backgrounds and are specialists with different, but complementary technical skills. Not only will this project join these skills, but over the next two years a number of other researchers will be added to the project, strengthening, among other aspects, its international component and extending to the training of young scientists in the US NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER There are two problems suggested in this proposal for further investigation. The first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER THEORETICAL INTERPERETATION OF KEPLER EXOPLANET ALBEDOS AND   REFLECTED LIGHT CURVES   The existence of extrasolar planets is now firmly established with over 200 planets known to orbit nearby Sun-like stars. The next important advances in this field are NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER RDE-RAD: Collaborative Research: Ohio's STEM Ability Alliance (OSAA): STEM Degrees and Careers for Ohioans with Disabilities  will increase the quantity and quality of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines and their entry into the STEM workforce. This collaborative project includes the following partners: Wright State University, the Ohio State University, Sinclair Community College, Columbus State Community College and numerous high schools in the Dayton and Columbus regions of Ohio. The primary goal of the project is to increase the quality and quantity of students with disabilities receiving associate, baccalaureate and graduate degrees in STEM and entering the STEM workforce, with the following specific three numerical goals: 1. Increase recruitment of high school students with disabilities (from a pool of 2000) and transition to STEM majors in OSAA community college and university partner institutions by 20% through student learning communities and mentoring opportunities. 2. Increase retention and graduation rates (associates, baccalaureate and graduate degrees) for existing STEM students with disabilities in OSAA's community college and university partner institutions from 10% to ~20% through student learning communities, mentoring (electronic and internships), and individualized STEM advisement. 3. Increase successful entry rates of OSAA STEM graduates (associates, baccalaureate and graduate) with disabilities into STEM graduate programs or STEM employment by 5% per year (from 2007 baseline measures) through focusing on employment issues in student learning communities, industry internships and parallel employer education. The evaluation team for this collaborative project includes two independent evaluators, Dr. Dianna Newman, the Director of the Evaluation Consortium and Professor of Educational and Counseling Psychology at the State University of New York, Albany, and Dr. Jeffrey White, an Assistant Professor of Education at Ashland University. Dr. James Altschuld, Emeritus faculty at the Ohio State University will serve as an on-site evaluation team member. Dissemination of project deliverables and reports will focus on institutions in Ohio region as well as sharing the model with a national post-secondary audience via a web-based diffusion portal, presentations at national conferences and publications in professional journals NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER CHARGE SIGN DEPENDENCE OF COSMIC RAY SOLAR MODULATION   The steady flux of cosmic rays entering the heliosphere provides a unique probe for studying the magnetic fields carried by the solar wind. Fluctuations in these magnetic fields produce an anti-cor NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The mental process humans use to comprehend a sentence, like this one,can be simulated by automata.  These automata are specific kinds of computer programs that, when run, mimic the steps cognitive scientists think occur between the point at which people read or hear individual words and when they know what whole sentences mean.In this project, the research team is constructing automata in which three factors, usually studied singly, are combined.  The first factor is the linguistic grammar, which characterizes what people know when they know a language.  The second is the control strategy, which determines the particular order in which comprehenders deploy this knowledge in time.  The third factor is the theory of memory for words and phrases.  The researchers expect these triply-endowed automata to match human performance in a variety of sentence types.  In addition, since automata can be mathematically altered to take into account alternative grammars, memories and control strategies, they can be used to gain insights that would not come easily from behavioral experiments with real people. For example, behavioral experiments with elderly adults might show the effects of reduced memory capacity on the sentence comprehension process.  However, using automata allows the researchers to selectively alter not only memory but also control and grammar, revealing the role of each in ways that human experiments could not.  Similarly, mathematically rendering the automaton's grammar more Spanish-like (as opposed to English-like), for example, could also yield a deeper understanding of how the three factors interact and, more broadly, how people understand one another NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The human brain is distinguished by costly energetic demands and enhanced plasticity. This combination of factors underlies some of the most unique cognitive capacities of our species. The brain's capacity for learning is greatest during childhood and involves the formation and refinement of new neuronal connections. This process is driven by high rates of energy consumption. This research project will identify the genetic changes during evolution that brought about the human brain and explore the causal link between the development of brain plasticity and metabolism. A major aim of this project involves charting the changes in the brain's energy utilization during the different maturational stages of humans. To accomplish this goal, the interdisciplinary team is using positron emission tomography scans of brain glucose consumption over the course of development from birth to adult stages.  These results will be integrated with the patterns presented by RNA and protein data on the thousands of genes that are expressed at changing levels in different brain regions across the same developmental stages.  Comparative data on the developmental expression of proteins and neuron morphology in great apes and macaque monkeys are also being obtained to determine whether the progression of molecular and cellular changes in human brain development are distinctively different from our close relatives.  The investigators expect to find coordinated expression patterns in brain energetic and brain plasticity genes showing evidence that adaptive evolution occurred in their regulatory machinery during the origin of humans.  The results should provide important clues about the organization and function of the molecular machinery that underpins the type of human brain plasticity that gives our species its exceptional capacity to incorporate experience and learning into the production of culture.  By focusing attention on brain energetic and brain plasticity genes that show adaptive evolution during recent human ancestry but are currently fixed across human populations, this project's focus on shared genes that define human cognitive abilities reinforces the conclusion of a common humanity.  Thus the results of this project should be of interest to the general public and to scientists across a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropology, neuroscience, molecular evolution, bioenergetics, endocrinology and pediatrics.  Experimental determination of total brain energetics during growth will enhance our ability to understand the age-specific tradeoffs that the acquisition of larger brains would have required during human evolutionary history, while also providing a new context in which to understand metabolic diseases such as diabetes.  Furthermore, this project will advance research and education by providing training opportunities for individuals at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project develops and implements recent  Fourier continuation alternating direction  (FC-AD) high-performance algorithms for nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDE), validates such solvers via comparisons with experiments and well-known approximations, and applies the resulting methodology to realistic medical configurations. A significant portion of the effort will design strategies to expand significantly the applicability of High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound (HIFU) (an emerging minimally invasive therapy that uses focused ultrasound beams to cause localized destruction of cancer tissue), and to enable design of optimal HIFU therapies for liver, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. In HIFU, an ultrasound source acoustically contacts the patient's skin to produce a high-amplitude ultrasonic field within the body that focuses on (and heats) a target region---thus leading to tumor destruction. The ultrasound propagates within a medium that is highly heterogeneous---most strongly so due to bone---thus affecting heating, which arises, for example, through perfusion by large blood vessels. Optimal HIFU requires a treatment-planning computational tool, which ensures treatment of the targeted zone and minimal impact on the surrounding tissue. Because previous 3D PDE solvers are more expensive, solution of such complex HIFU problems has not been possible. Using alternating directions and a rapidly convergent Fourier series for non-periodic functions, the proposed FC-AD method has provided for the first time high-order unconditionally stable numerics for general 3D domains at a cost that grows only linearly with the size of the spatial discretization; preliminary tests have demonstrated the capability of the FC-AD method to address satisfactorily the types of nonlinear acoustic problems under consideration. This approach will make possible the study of the effect of heterogeneity on field focusing, heat deposition, and ablation properties - enabling highly optimized HIFU treatment. The associated geometric/computational demands provide a powerful driving force for additional developments of our solvers, geometry modeling tools, etc. The proposed multi-disciplinary interactions will further significantly the state of the art in all three fields: computational science, nonlinear wave physics, and cancer therapy.Broader Significance of the Project:  Already a well-established technique for medical imaging, ultrasound is seeing widening use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications ranging from tumor detection, to kidney stone destruction, to targeted drug delivery. Both the accuracy of ultrasound images, and the precision and reliability with which ultrasound can deliver energy or modify the structure of tissue, depend critically on the type of software that will result from this effort, providing a capability to predict the propagation properties of ultrasonic fields in biological media. The resulting methodology will be applicable across the broad spectrum of biomedical ultrasonics - enabling rapid instrument prototyping, treatment planning, and ultrasound safety assessment. Although the work plan is focused on the modeling of HIFU-based cancer treatment, the potential for effecting key advances in multiple therapeutic and diagnostic applications is very significant NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The use of digital maps, imagery and global positioning system (GPS) receivers to support a range of field survey activities is perceived as an area that has potentially high payoff in terms of reduced costs and improved data quality for national surveys.  At present, however, appropriate survey methods for effectively using these resources are lacking.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theoretically grounded yet practical approach for designing computer-assisted survey instruments that rely on geospatial resources to support location-based field tasks.  The project will contribute to this goal by developing naturalistic decision-making models for distinct location-based survey tasks that reflect the diversity of strategies that result from individual differences (e.g., in spatial ability), and by developing model software interfaces that accommodate variation in strategies for using computers and integrating environmental and digital geospatial information.  The work will begin with building naturalistic decision-making models to describe a survey task referred to as address verification, which involves evaluating whether the location of a housing unit on the ground is accurately depicted on a map.  The model will describe how task implementation varies in relation to individual abilities, such as mental rotation of spatial objects, perspective taking, and spatial memory.  The approach involves outlining a high-level naturalistic decision-making model to describe cues (information) available to and selected by a field staff member, hypotheses (if any) that are formulated from this information, and the action selected that leads to completion of the task.  Using this template, a series of more specific models will be created that describe how variation in spatial ability affects the decision-making process.  Expert evaluation and field-based cognitive walk-through methods will be used to further build and refine models.  With the understanding gained from these decision-modeling investigations, models of two user-interface views will be developed for the address verification task.  The first user-interface view will be a basic interface that provides the required map functionality without taking any user differences into consideration.  The second user-interface view will be designed to be an inclusive interface using what was learned in our modeling research.  Information on variation in field behaviors (e.g., preferred cues, map use, task order) in relation to spatial ability will be used to create the set of screens for the inclusive user-interface views.  Survey field experts and cognitive psychologists will evaluate these draft screens in relation to their knowledge and experience with field staff behaviors.  This research is an important first step of an iterative process to develop interface design principles for location-based survey field tasks that rely on an inclusive software design approach to accommodate individual differences. This research will make several substantive contributions to both basic and applied science.  First, the project will begin developing a theoretical approach for effectively incorporating geospatial information resources in computer-assisted instruments for field surveys.  Through this process, naturalistic decision-making theory will be extended to include heterogeneity in individual abilities, specifically spatial ability. In addition, user interface design approaches will be broadened to handle the context of geospatial data for a task involving scientific protocols.  The practical impact of the research will be felt in fielding surveys with improved field operations efficiency and enhanced quality of data and survey estimates for the national statistical infrastructure and other large-scale surveys.  This project will provide students in human-computer interaction, computer science, and statistics with a substantive experience with interdisciplinary and inter-organizational research collaboration.  The research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER ULYSSES HI-SCALE INVESTIGATION PROJECT The objective of this work is to provide the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory support in processing / distributing / and analyzing the stream of magnetospheric related data received from the HI SCALE monitor NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Humans are remarkably adept at recognizing the actions of others, even based on movement patterns alone. This ability is most dramatically shown by  point-light biological motion  animations, in which just a few dots are visible, placed at joints or other critical places.  It is often easy to recognize which action is being performed, what the actor's emotional state is, and even who the person is. Although we know this information is available, little is known as to how it is perceived. This is particularly interesting because visual motion and form cues are assumed to be processed in parallel and independent streams, yet these two types of information have to be combined for point-light displays to be meaningful. Neuroimaging studies in humans have further linked biological motion perception to a regions of the brain called the superior temporal sulcus, which seems to be involved in many complex processes including social perception. With the support of the National Science Foundation, Dr. Emily Grossman at the University of California Irvine will investigate the perceptual means for the recognition of biological motion, and the brain systems involved. The perception tests will use a novel behavioral technique in which perceivers make yes/no decisions about biological motion animations viewed on a computer screen.  The brain work will use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to test specific hypotheses of the combination of form and motion cues in biological motion perception. These experiments will also measure the tuning properties of brain regions supporting biological motion perception, something that has already been achieved in monkeys but not yet in humans.Theories of biological motion draw from a number of scientific domains, including research in visual perception, social perception, action understanding and motor imitation (the  mirror neuron  system). Results from the present project will influence thinking in all of these domains. The work in this proposal also involves hands-on research experience for undergraduate and graduate students, including the design and analysis of neuroimaging studies. Because UC Irvine and Dr. Grossman's laboratory both have a historical record of recruiting an ethnically diverse student population, these projects provide the opportunity to promote science among under-represented minorities. Finally, as part of the pedagogical activities in this CAREER proposal, this project will support the development of a new Neuroimaging Laboratory course in which students are trained in the practical skills necessary for brain imaging data analysis, a skill highly desirable in the upcoming cohort of cognitive neuroscientists NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This project examines the structure and dynamics of social networks in the prehispanic U.S. Southwest. It examines the period of time between A.D. 1200 to 1550, when there were massive displacements of population that coincided with the formation of large, aggregated villages throughout the area. Using information culled from unpublished and published reports, museum collections, and limited archaeological fieldwork it supplements an existing database of known Native American settlements in the region that was developed with prior NSF funding. The project has five major goals. First is to add material culture information (especially ceramics and obsidian) to an existing GIS that contains only spatial data developed by the Center for Desert Archaeology. This GIS database includes roughly 2000 late prehispanic sites across the Southwest. Second is to characterize the structure and dynamics of social networks in the area during a period of great population flux and pan-regional interconnectivity. The third is to apply new methods and theories of social network analysis from sociology, Geographic Information System (GIS), physics, and mathematics to archaeology. Fourth, researchers are to test current theories about network structure and change using high-resolution archaeological data. And fifth, the researchers are to integrate social network theory with powerful tools of spatial analyses such as GIS. Southwest archaeology has the potential to provide a  deep time  perspective on the rise and fall of social networks within a relatively controlled and circumscribed environment. Social network analysis has largely concentrated on contemporary examples and this is the first application of social network theory and methods to a regional archaeological database that measures change over centuries and that is more analogous to the kinds of interactions that take place in many non-urban settings throughout the world. Project results are presented in a manner accessible to the public in variety of media, including the Center for Desert Archaeology?s website, public lectures, and widely distributed publications NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER During Leg 205 of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) two boreholes were drilled into active hydrologic formations on the Costa Rica margin west of the Nicoya Peninsula. One borehole penetrated through the overriding plate into the décollement at ODP Site 1255. The other borehole penetrated through the subducting sediment section and plate into permeable igneous basement at ODP Site 1253. These two boreholes were sealed and instrumented with a borehole observatory (CORK), allowing pressure, temperature, fluid flow velocity, and fluid chemical composition to be measured within the formation. The 1.5-yr pressure and two-year temperature, fluid velocity, and fluid chemical composition records collected to date have provided a basic knowledge of formation properties, although fluids within the boreholes had yet to reach steady state with the surrounding formations. The data also provide evidence that tectonic forcing related to subduction results in measurable transients in pressure, temperature, fluid velocity, and fluid composition within the décollement. While the initial data provide a baseline for approaching several important scientific and technical questions, they have raised new key questions that will be addressed from additional continuous borehole data. The investigators will a 6-day submersible operation to retrieve instruments and stored data that will provide a continuous record of formation temperature, pressure, fluid flow rate, and chemical composition for an additional five years, from the time of the last visit in 2004 to 2009. This project will result in an extremely valuable long-term synchronous record of hydrologic, geochemical, and geodynamic activity at this subduction zone, and establish a technical and scientific foundation for future borehole studies in a broad range of tectonically and hydrologically active settings NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER One of the products of human development and population growth is global-scale alteration of the environment, as evidenced by changes in water supply and climate.  Environmental change is also evident in the transformation of ecosystems, with accompanying biodiversity loss, biological invasions, and emerging diseases).  This interdisciplinary research project aims to understand how these changes affect the global pattern of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).  These diseases are a major threat to human health and the economy in the U.S. and elsewhere.  They result in hundreds of thousands of human lives lost annually and tens of billions of dollars to national and global economies.  Despite these impacts and billions of dollars spent on drug and vaccine development, there has been little progress in understanding how anthropogenic changes drive the risk of disease emergence globally, nor in developing predictive and preventive approaches to these threats.  The investigator's main hypothesis is that socioeconomic and environmental changes, together with disease traits, shape global patterns of disease distribution and emergence.  Previous studies have proposed that disease emergence is driven by human population expansion, migration, land-use change, climate change, changes to agriculture and medical technology, increased susceptibility to infection, and other factors.  They will test these hypotheses by integrating global-scale socioeconomic and environmental data sets with biogeographic data on wildlife, human and livestock populations, and pathogen distributions.  First, they will determine the major drivers of emerging infectious diseases by analyzing the linkages among global spatial datasets on recent changes in socioeconomic and environmental data and the global distribution of zoonotic, food-borne, vector-borne, and drug-resistant EIDs.  They then will develop predictive models of current and future risk of disease emergence based on recent changes to and projected trends in human-related drivers.  They will use spatial mathematical models to identify geographic regions where there is high potential for disease emergence at local scales and for pandemic (global) spread.This project will provide education and training opportunities for fifteen undergraduate and graduate students on summer research projects and a postdoctoral assistant.  The investigators will make their databases available online to the scientific community through web data portals.  They will produce peer-reviewed publications, engage in offer media interviews, make conference presentations, give policy-relevant briefings, and work with developing country non-governmental organization leaders who incorporate environmental health issues into their programs.  They will disseminate their results to national and intergovernmental agencies of public health (WHO, CDC), development (UNDP, IDRC), trade (FAO, OIE), and conservation (IUCN, DIVERSITAS, UNESCO, UNEP, EPA).  The project's ultimate goal is to have its research results and products used to help decide how best to allocate the scarce funds and resources available for surveillance and control of disease in global public health and development.  An award resulting from the FY 2008 NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) supports this project.  All NSF directorates and offices are involved in the coordinated management of the HSD competition and the portfolio of HSD awards NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER AST-0708607HamiltonA previous NSF-funded collaboration in informal science education (DRL-0337286, PI Tom Lucas) led to the creation of two shows about black holes: a high-resolution large format digital dome show, and a Nova/PBS television show.  The Black Hole Flight Simulator created for that collaboration produces accurate general relativistic visualizations of what it is like to fly around, into, and even through black holes, in the context of a vision to 'give black holes to the world' in a way that people can more easily grasp, that is, visually.  This project will take this vision to the next level, carrying out the research behind the visualizations, and taking the representations to new heights of realism, educational content, and visual impact.  It involves research in numerical general relativity, coupled with the motivation to make the work accessible not only to scientists but to the world at large, and working with film-making professionals interested in bringing real science to the screen.The broad goals of this proposal tightly entwine science and societal impact.  Existing and future visualizations will be seen by a great many people in the US and throughout the world.  High-performance scientifically accurate real-time visualizations should become a central component of science education, especially in relativity where everyday experience is a poor guide.  The scientists involved will gain literacy in visualization for non-scientists, bridging the cultural gap between scientists and the public NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Our group plans to develop a novel type of thermal and cold neutron counting detector based on Boron and Gadolinium doped microchannel plates (MCPs). The new type of neutron imaging detectors will be optimized for imaging thermal neutrons with high detection efficiency (up to 50 %) and even higher for cold neutrons, spatial (~55 µm) and time resolution of ~1 ms (or gated detection with gate accuracy 100 MHz with active area scalable to rectangular configuration of 28 x (N*14) mm2. Another attractive feature of the detector will be its ability to be synchronized with the external trigger, allowing energy selective imaging with a pulsed source. The neutron imaging devices will be rigorously tested at a neutron beamline, in collaboration with our colleagues from Nova Scientific. The proposed detection system will greatly facilitate thermal neutron imaging with very high counting rates, sensitivity and resolution, substantially increasing the accuracy of existing experiments (e.g. SNS residual stress profile measurements with the engineering instrument Vulcan, studies of small samples under very high pressures with the high pressure instrument SNAP, fuel cell studies), and may additionally open up entirely new areas of non destructive testing with modern neutron sources. Non-technical AbstractNeutrons are nuclear particles with no electronic charge which are very useful for studying the details of structure at the atomic level. They are particularly useful because they can probe atomic arrangements and study important materials properties such as magnetism and the vibrational properties of atoms in a crystal. However, detecting neutrons has always been a challenge. This proposal plans to use pieces of glass with many fine holes as a neutron detector. The neutrons pass through the holes, interact with the glass at the edge of the holes, and then, because of the special properties of the glass (addition of Boron or Gadolinium) the neutrons are converted to light, which can then be detected. The small size of the holes allows very high precision in locating the position of each neutron, so that images can be constructed. In addition, this detector system can count neutrons at the same rate that they are produced in the best neutron sources, allowing experiments that take full advantage of those new sources NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This research investigates the way political conflicts are influenced by sacred values, which are values that incorporate ethical or religious beliefs and are associated with human behavior that seems motivated independently of its prospect of success.  Past research has approached the study of political conflicts as though they were between instrumental actors -- people and groups aiming to maximize their instrumental gains and minimize losses. Indeed, rational actor models have long dominated strategic thinking at all levels of government policy. However, many key components of decision-making vary with context, across social relations and domains, and as a function of whether or not a choice has ethical or moral entailments. The guiding hypothesis of this research is that people in political conflicts make non-instrumental judgments and decisions when they conceptualize the issues under dispute as sacred values, such as when groups of people transform land from a simple resource into a  holy site.   Previous research carried out by this interdisciplinary team of investigators has advanced theoretical understanding of sacred values, developed novel methods of studying their impact on political decision-making and negotiations, and demonstrated their role in non-instrumental and often violent choices in political contexts. However, scientific investigation of sacred values is still in its infancy and more needs to be done. Specifically, this research: 1) investigates biological and cultural antecedents of sacred values and the social identity functions of sacred values across cultures, 2) probes the role of sacred values in influencing violent and seemingly intractable political conflict, and 3) uses this knowledge to investigate possibilities of reducing political and cultural conflict. The methodology integrates basic and applied research, combining brain imaging studies with laboratory and field experiments, surveys and interviews in order to provide  real-world  relevance for policymakers as well NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Introduction: This proposal seeks to carry out further research on the failure of SSC (the superconducting super collider) project in order to produce an extended monograph on the topic.  As yet, there is no comprehensive history of the SSC that discusses the diverse scientific, technological, economic, and political influences that initially worked together to get the project launched but subsequently led its demise. The research team has already gathered much of the information and has published shorter journal articles on the subject. The primary goal of the project is to fill in critical gaps that the researchers identify in the proposal. To date, they perceive a dearth of in-depth oral history interviews with crucial physicists who did not join the SSC laboratory, and arrangements for such interviews have been made. In addition, none of the SSC project managers have participated in oral history interviews, and a number of them have agreed to do so. The researchers already have records of such interviews with many DOE officials, but there is a serious need to complement these interviews by doing research in documents, which is part of the program of work. Another area that will receive attention is the refusal of the European high-energy physics community to participate as equal partners in SSC. Extended interviews with key European physicists will be done; others will be identified and interviewed as part of the process. Interviews with Japanese physicists have already been conducted, and this material will be incorporated into the monograph that is to be produced. Political aspects of the international components will be integrated into the story. Finally, additional attention will be devoted to providing a considered understanding of the conflicting narratives developed by SSC's supporters and opponents and how that served to shape public discourse.Intellectual Merit:  The reasons for the failure of the SSC were many and complex. The researchers have managed to connect with many of the persons, organizations, and areas which contributed to the final result. Having these components enumerated and their contributions made clear (to the extent that this is possible) will be of great service to the practitioners of particle physics as well as to those charged with stewardship for this science. The resulting detailed presentation and analysis of the history of the SSC will be invaluable in light of the very impressive quantity of materials (documents, interviews, etc.) the researchers will have collected and assembled.Broader Impact:  The final report of this project will be a key contribution to the history of contemporary science, and to an understanding of the development, funding, and support of large-scale scientific-technical-engineering projects. The proposed activity will also result in important contributions to our understanding of the factors responsible for the public and governmental support of basic science, applied science, and technology. These in turn will be valuable resources in the teaching of the interaction between science and technology and the culture at large, and most importantly in the role that international cooperation and international institutions will play in the future when considering such large projects as the Large Hadron Collider, the space station, investigations of global climate change, large scale geophysical projects, and genomics NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER DRU: Modeling Nuclear Disaster Risk: The Effects of Perceived Risk and Radiation Exposure on Post-Chernobyl Psychosocial and Health Behavior Outcomes in Ukrainian ResidentsRoseMarie Perez Foster, Principal InvestigatorUniversity of Colorado, Boulder, Institute of Behavioral Science, Natural Hazards Centerwith participation of research personnel fromColorado State UniversityAcademy of Labor and Social Relations, Kiev, UkraineProject AbstractThis research project aims to develop models of human nuclear disaster risk that will more scientifically inform the complex psychosocial and health behavior consequences of radiological and other toxic disasters. This will be accomplished through study of a representative sample population exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine ? the largest nuclear disaster caused by an industrial plant malfunction. Previous research on nuclear catastrophes such as Hiroshima, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, have clearly pointed out that the psychological and behavior consequences of these events reverberate in the long term, delving deeply into a community?s life for years after they have been exposed to the nuclear accident itself. Anxiety-ridden survivors lie in wait of dreaded illnesses; inhibit employment, social and outdoor activities; restrict family births fearing congenital malformation; overuse substances; and utilize medical services in far larger proportions than nonexposed fellow countrymen/ women (WHO, 2006; Havenaar et al. 2003; Yamada & Izumi, 2002). For some survivors, these behavioral consequences are further exaggerated by serious mental health disturbance and radiogenic cancers. As yet, it remains unclear how much of the long lasting behavioral consequences of radiation disasters are explained by the radiation dose itself; or by a community?s ?perception? of the potential risk it has been exposed to. Our study team will investigate this question.The study will conduct a probability sampling of current residents in the Kiev and Zhitomir oblasts (states) of Ukraine. The research team, consisting of a research psychologist, radiation physicist, hazards sociologist and medical consultant, will: (1) reconstruct levels of radiation dose from exposure to Chernobyl radionuclide fallout for each study participant; (2) measure long-term psychosocial and health behavior consequences of the nuclear disaster in the population and (3) endeavor to understand the complex relationships among radiation dose exposure, perceived radiation exposure, and risk projections for illness. Given its unique combination of scientists, it is the first time that individual external radiation dose from a nuclear incident will be so carefully reconstructed for a study focused on human psychosocial behavioral effects.  The findings will also offer more refined multidisciplinary knowledge on the interaction between physical toxic exposure and the perception of  risk ? a bio-psycho-social conundrum in academic research  (Slovic, 2000). The current study is viewed as having a direct impact on the prevention of adverse psychosocial consequences associated with communities exposed to nuclear accidents. More broadly, the project addresses ramifications of the increasing portent for nuclear disaster events, given the proliferation of nuclear power plants and waste sites; growing capacity of nations to mount nuclear weapons programs; and the potential for political groups to perpetrate radiological terrorism. These concerns for human safety and well-being are paramount at this time. We believe that scientifically derived risk communication and education about these hazards will be powerful tools in mitigating their psychosocial consequences in the global community NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The investigator and his colleagues propose a new paradigm-shifting approach towards high resolution and high contrast imaging, which combines revolutions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging with equally cutting edge mathematical developments.The approach uses non-linear feedback between the detector and the sample, so that the measured field is fed back to the MRI magnet.  The unstable feedback increases the dynamical contrast between normal and cancerous cells.  This highly nontraditional approach will be complemented by incorporating compressed sensing, a data analysis technique where mathematical algorithms are used to extract specific features and images from a relatively small number of measurements.Finally, multiple sources and detectors, which coupled with compressed sensing and feedback imaging can collect data in parallel will be implemented together, and modern filter-diagonalization techniques will be used to synthesize the data leading to faster images.      Overall, the research and development that the principal investigator and his colleagues propose will revolutionize MRI.  By applying nontraditional measurement and imaging technique, the contrast between tumors and normal areas will be increased many fold.  The increase will be based on the same physical phenomena, chaos, that is used to by birds and jet fighters to quickly switch their direction. The revolutionary paradigm will will eventually make it much cheaper and faster to do an MRI scan, thereby having enormously broad impacts. In 2008, an estimated 1,680,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer, and approximately 670,000 people will die.  Between 10%-35% could have been saved with earlier detection.This highlights the need for improved early detection methods, which could have saved many patients. A large (2-5 or more) reduction MRI acquisition time, which is not feasible with conventional methods, coupled with the enhanced feature resolution native to the proposed approach, will allow for faster and cheaper cancer screening, which is crucial to improved early detection and thus reducing deaths due to cancer.  Besides cancer detection, there are numerous other imaging applications that stand to benefit from significantly decreased scan time and cost, such as industrial sensing (for example uniformity of fruits in agriculture) and homeland security applications, including highly sensitive detection of concealed materials NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award supports graduate student travel to the 12th Workshop on the Physics of Dusty Plasmas to be held in Boulder, Colorado in May 2009. The objectives of this workshop are to review recent developments, to define outstanding issues and challenges, and to foster collaborations among the relevant disciplines. The interaction between dust and plasmas in laboratory, industrial, atmospheric, solar system, and astrophysical settings have yielded a new and rich phenomenology with potential applications NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER REU Site at CENS:Sensing Applications in Earthquake and Environmental EngineeringAbstractThe Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS), headquartered at UCLA, is a multidisciplinary research center focused on developing embedded networked sensing (ENS) technology and applying this revolutionary technology to crucial scientific and social applications.  CENS infrastructure provides an ideal environment for undergraduate researchers to gain research experience and become part of a productive and collaborative research community.  This REU project represents an effective approach to supporting undergraduate research experience, particularly focused on promoting long-term interest in science and engineering for women and underrepresented minorities.  The Center?s approach to undergraduate education is based on our expertise in working with undergraduates, a comprehensive and longitudinal evaluation of our programs, the evolution of research, collaboration and mentoring within the Center, and a body of literature that examines undergraduates? experiences in science and engineering.  The CENS REU site experience takes a systems approach to undergraduate training, emphasizing Environment, Experience, and Engagement.  This approach facilitates development of a tight-knit cohort of undergraduate researchers engaging in forefront research.  Our mentoring community is vital to increasing student competence, developing collegial relationships, and improving collaborative interactions.  A ten-week comprehensive program, housed at UCLA, intellectually focuses on civil and environmental engineering applications of earthquake and environmental monitoring research.  Research projects engage participating undergraduates in ongoing research within this application area, while contextualizing this research within the scope of the Center.  The program includes mechanisms for students to understand the commonalities and connections between their application area and the development of broader ENS technologies. Additionally, the program introduces students to data and data visualization tools that are common across the Center?s applications areas NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The past several decades have seen a tremendous growth in the depth and breadth of our knowledge regarding social networks.  While the majority of research to date has centered on the study of networks within small communities, the properties of networks in larger populations constitute a topic of increasing interest.  Prior research has pointed to geography as a key factor in network formation, suggesting a spatial approach to the description and modeling of large-scale network structure.  Further progress toward understanding the dynamics of large-scale social networks is hampered by the lack of data on the geographical structure of personal ties, and by the relative paucity of specialized methods for analyzing such data.  The purpose of this project is to address these issues through two basic thrust areas: the collection of novel data on the spatial structure of large-scale social networks, and methodological research that will allow these data to contribute to our scientific understanding of social structure.  The data to be collected will contain information about the spatial and demographic structure of personal ties at regional and national scales.  These data will enable the estimation and evaluation of models for the effects of geography on network structure, and for the impact of social networks on neighborhood-level outcomes.  The methodological research conducted as part of this project will enhance current network models -- which characterize the probability of different types of social ties between individuals -- by including the effects of spatial constraints, geographic heterogeneity, and demography.  These data and methodological contributions will enhance fundamental knowledge about the complex ways that individuals interact with other through space.  To perform these tasks, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team drawn from the fields of sociology, geography, and criminology; the team's research will leverage current developments in network modeling and spatial statistics, as well as computational advances in the simulation of networks with large numbers of nodes.  In addition to expanding our knowledge of the social ties which help knit communities together, the project will create new data and software tools that will be shared with other researchers and educators.  The practical utility of the methodology and tools developed through this project will also be demonstrated with an application of spatial network modeling to the assessment and calibration of information dissemination systems for use during natural disasters and other large-scale emergency situations.  By measuring and modeling the properties of large-scale social networks, this project will yield new insights into the social fabric in which people are all embedded NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This proposal aims to transform research in mathematics and computer science by bringing together two major research tracks which have been progressing in parallel (albeit with nontrivial interaction). In mathematics, the object of study in many areas (including analysis, number theory, ergodic theory and combinatorics) is captured by the question: ?What random-like properties does a (deterministic) mathematical structure have?? In computer science, the object of study in many areas (including network theory, error correction, computational complexity and derandomization) is captured by the question ?Can we deterministically and efficiently design objects with specific random-like properties?? The PIs view the two Math and CS tracks (respectively) as analytic and synthetic approaches for understanding the same fundamental pseudorandomness phenomena and its interaction with structure.Computer science has been mostly a passive consumer of mathematics, relying on the mathematical analysis of structures to build desireable objects. We propose to transform this one-way use to a full fledged collaboration, through the use of the computational view of randomness to analyze mathematical structures. Preliminary applications of this tool, many by the PIs, have already led to major breakthroughs both in new understanding of mathematical objects and in the use of these objects as the basis for constructions in computer science. Examples of recent breakthroughs resulting from this cross-fertilization include work on expanders in Cayley graphs, extractors from sum-product theorems, arithmetic (and other) progressions in primes, and the use of Gowers? norms in complexity. Many rely on the conceptual computational tool of pseudorandomness, the inability of any of a class of tests to tell the difference between a random object and the object in question. This notion arose in complexity-theoretic approaches to cryptography, but has since had wide applicability in computer science (e.g. in derandomizing probabilistic algorithms NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER With the support of this CAREER Award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Xuefei Huang, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Toledo, will develop novel methods based on the reactivity-independent, one-pot strategy to assemble a library of synthetic, contaminant-free hyaluronan oligosaccharides (sHA) and sHA analogs with well defined structures, which will be useful tools for characterization of their biological interactions on a molecular level and provide exciting leads for developments of novel therapeutic interventions. The successful assembly of an sHA library will demonstrate the power and advantages of the reactivity-independent, iterative one-pot approach, and the knowledge gained from these studies will be invaluable to the preparation of oligosaccharide libraries in general.Professor Xuefei Huang, with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, will assay the sHA library obtained for their stimulatory activities towards toll like receptor (TLR)-4, an important receptor involved in innate immunity. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides play important roles in a wide range of biological events, such as tumor cell growth suppression, sensitization of multidrug resistant cancer cells, angiogenesis, and immuno-stimulation. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, undergraduate and high school students will be integrated into the research. Broader impacts of the proposed project are in education of not only science students and researchers but also the whole community.  In order to inform the general public about the impacts of science on society, Professor Huang plans to organize outreach activities such as Chemistry Open House and Saturday Morning Science NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Lead: 0835742  Non-leads: 0835571, 0835611, 0835621PIs:  C. O?Hern (Lead), R. Behringer, L. Kondic, K. MischaikowCDI-Type II: Collaborative Research: Computational Homology, Jamming, and Force Chains in Dense Granular FlowsThis project will employ a highly interdisciplinary approach that integrates new geometrical techniques, modeling, and experiments to address fundamental, open questions concerning the physical properties of granular media and other jammed materials such as glasses, foams, and colloids.  The hallmark of jammed materials is that they resist applied forces like solids, but are disordered like liquids.  In addition, many jammed materials possess heterogeneous, ramified structures known as force chain networks when external forces are applied.   Although the existence of force chains has been known for decades, a quantitative understanding of their role in physical processes has proved elusive in part because previous studies have been unable to devise an unbiased and general definition for them.  Precise identification and characterization of force chains and the response of jammed materials to applied forces will likely have a transformative impact in many arenas.  For example, financial and energy costs of handling and processing of granular materials, typically with high inefficiency, is estimated to be at least one trillion dollars in the US alone.  Also, avalanches and earthquakes are examples where the unpredictable behavior of granular media detrimentally impacts mankind.  In this work, we will apply novel mathematical techniques coupled with computer simulations and experiments to obtain a quantitative, predictive description of jammed materials. The outreach efforts of this project emphasize providing educational opportunities to students from underrepresented groups.  We will organize education and recruiting trips to predominantly female liberal arts colleges in the Northeast and historically black schools in North Carolina, such as North Carolina Central University, and others in the Southeast. These trips will include giving technical and popular lectures, including demonstrations to show that research on jammed materials is intriguing and important.  During informal meetings with students we will emphasize that careers in science and technology are rewarding and open to those in underrepresented groups.  To stimulate further student interest in this research, we will hold biannual 2-day lab open houses so that promising undergraduates can be exposed to both experimental and theoretical aspects of our research.  To encourage close collaboration among researchers in the field of jammed materials, we will organize biannual interdisciplinary workshops.  The inaugural workshop, ``Computational Homology Tools Applied to Jamming and Flow in Granular Materials'' is scheduled for the winter of 2009 NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This HBCU-RISE proposal seeks support to implement a new Neuroscience PhD program and to build and develop our state-wide neuroscience network at Delaware State University. The project will support student stipends and research supplies, start up and release time for new faculty with neuroscience-related research and support for a weekly neuroscience seminar that will rotate among consortium institutions and be live streamed to all of them. The RISE project will provide resources for new educational opportunities for minority students and increase their opportunities to be involved in cutting edge research in an area with growing career opportunities and scientific importance. This project integrates research and education by supporting graduate students, supporting new faculty members to establish independent research programs at an HBCU and fostering scientific collaborations among faculty at DSU and partner institutions. The strengthened research and research-training infrastructure at DSU will increase the number of minority students successfully pursuing PhD degrees in the Life Sciences and increase faculty productivity. The neuroscience network will serve as a national model for successful partnership between HBCUs, majority institutions, research institutes, and industry NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the  International Workshop in Fourier Analysis and Partial Differential Equations  that will be held at Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China) from December 15-17, 2008. This workshop is being conducted in conjunction with the joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Shanghai Mathematical Society that will be hosted by Fudan University (Shanghai, China) from December 17-21, 2008. Thus many of the workshop speakers will also speak in the special session on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations at the Shanghai meeting. The confluence of the two meetings ensures that an unusually rich and broad collection of speakers will participate in the workshop. The range of topics is also very impressive, covering such active areas as multi-parameter Fourier analysis, Hardy spaces, Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory, multi-linear singular integrals, subelliptic PDE, dispersive PDE, infinity Laplace equations, and Monge-Ampere equations. The format of the workshop provides ample opportunity for young mathematicians to speak NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The URM program at the University of Toledo will train undergraduate students, especially those from under-represented minority groups, in research and prepare them for future graduate study in environmental biology.  Four cohorts of six students, who will be drawn from a very diverse student population on campus, will receive financial support to participate in two calendar years of intensive, independent, and integrated research and mentoring program.  At least eleven faculty members will serve as mentors in this URM program and engage the students in a wide-range of environmental and ecological disciplines focusing on stresses to the land-lake ecosystem interface, including (i) toxic algal blooms and exotic species, (ii) declining fish spawning habitat and emerging VHS viral disease, (iii) wetlands and water quality, and (iv) terrestrial impacts on watershed services.  URM students will interact in a joint course and seminar curriculum while earning independent research credits.  This URM will provide regular interaction with agency and environmental professionals to develop an understanding of the significance and application of their research work, while augmenting the understanding of the role of anthropogenic stressors in water quality crises.

The goals of this Center are to develop a predictive understanding of biological and ecological toxicology for nanomaterials, and of their transport and transformation in the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in an integrated research program to determine how the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials determine their environmental impacts from the cellular scale to that of entire ecosystems.  The research approach promises to be transformative to the science of ecotoxicology by combining high throughput screening assays with computational and physiological modeling to predict impacts at higher levels of biological organization.  The Center will unite the fields of engineering, chemistry, physics, materials science, cell biology, ecology, toxicology, computer modeling, and risk assessment to establish the foundations of a new scientific discipline: environmental nanotoxicology.Research on nanomaterials and development of nanotechnology is expanding rapidly and producing discoveries that promise to benefit the nation?s economy, and improve our ability to live sustainably on earth.  There is now a critical need to reduce uncertainty about the possible negative consequences of nanomaterials in the environment, while at the same time providing guidelines for their safe design to prevent environmental and toxicological hazards.  This Center addresses this societal need by developing a scientific framework of risk prediction that is paradigm-shifting in its potential to keep pace with the commercial expansion of nanotechnology.  Another impact of the Center will be development of human resources for the academic community, industry and government by training the next generation of nano-scale scientists, engineers, and regulators to anticipate and mitigate potential future environmental hazards of nanotechnology.  Partnerships with other centers will act as powerful portals for the dissemination and integration of research findings to the scientific, educational, and industrial communities, both nationally and internationally.  This Center will contribute to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs and expand representation and access to this research and knowledge network through an internship program directed at California community colleges serving underrepresented groups.  Outreach activities, including a journalist?scientist communication program, will serve to inform both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology and how to safely produce, use, and dispose of nanomaterials NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Duke UniversityCarnegie Mellon UniversityHoward UniversityStanford UniversityUniversity of KentuckyVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State UniversityThis award establishes a Center to conduct research and education on the environmental impacts of nanomaterials.  It will advance discovery of general principles that determine the movement and transformation of nanomaterials in the environment and their effects on organisms and ecosystems.  The Center will further translate this knowledge into the language of risk assessment to guide nanotechnology in ways that minimize harm to the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in integrated research to establish a theoretical understanding of how the physics and surface chemistry of nanomaterials determine their interactions with the environment, from the molecular level to that of entire ecosystems.  The Center will develop new methods for detection and tracking of natural and manufactured nanomaterials in the environment.  Information on nanomaterial properties and environmental impacts will be synthesized into models that can be used to predict environmental risk.  Nanotechnology holds great promise both to the nation's economic growth and to enhance our ability to live in more sustainable ways.  However, the responsible implementation of this technology is hampered by uncertainty over the environmental impacts of nanomaterials. There is an urgent societal need to understand this risk, while at the same time providing guidelines for safe design to prevent environmental harm.  This Center will conduct the fundamental research necessary to reduce uncertainty in the environmental impacts of nanotechnology.  It will contribute uniquely to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs.  The Center will also promote interdisciplinary training of the next generation of nanoscale scientists and engineers in ways that broaden participation in the newly emerging field of environmental nanoscience.  In collaboration with national laboratories, non-governmental organizations, and industry, the Center will further research and education goals and engage in outreach that informs both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER MAGNETIC FIELDS AND CURRENTS IN THE MARTIAN IONOSPHERE The interaction of the solar wind plasma with the Martian ionosphere creates current systems in the Martian ionosphere. The structure of the magnetic fields measured by the spacecraft is not the simpl NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Project Description The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) in conjunction with three independent school districts (ISD), San Antonio, North East, Northside, and the Alamo Community College District will partner with South Texas Oncology and Hematology, Lockheed Martin, CPS Energy and the Mayor of San Antonio.  The San Antonio Mathematics and Science Education Partnership (SAMSEP) will bring together all stakeholders from the various demographic groups to establish a strong and comprehensive partnership with a shared vision of addressing local and regional gaps in student achievement in STEM education.  The long-term goal of the project is to prepare students to succeed in higher education and contribute to workforce needs by creating a regional Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Center at UTSA that will serve as a hub for the coordination of efforts between the city?s fifteen school districts, the five campus community college districts and the other four institutions of higher learning.  The objectives are to increase student achievement in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics K-16, increase the rigor of STEM courses offered, align curriculum, particularly between high school and first year college, and develop a broad base of support within the civic and business community.  Partners in civic leadership and the business community are a critical addition to the academic group as they can assist in practical training and identifying local job related needs in the expanding manufacturing and high tech industry in San Antonio.  The results of this START project will be incorporated into a needs assessment that will provide a framework for STEM faculty involvement, address the five MSP key features, implement and assess pilot projects and support the development of a follow up Targeted Partnership. The intended project has the potential to positively impact a large number of underserved students in the San Antonio. The proposed activity will serve as a pathway to broadly integrate STEM learning across diverse partner organizations and to provide additional opportunities for collaborative engagement to vertically aligned and/or horizontally aligned K-20 institutions of learning.  A product will be a digital social networking tool that after initially supporting partner interactions will become a resource for others NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER AERO INSTITUTE COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM The AERO Institute is pleased to submit this unsolicited proposal entitled  Comprehensive Educational Support Infrastructure System (CESIS) to the NASA Ames Research Center for funding NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER 0414462  Bonner  The goal of this planning proposal is to create an integrated, collaborative framework for coastal margings resreach addressing the four US costal margins, including Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and Laurentian Great Lakes. The envisioned network will support data collection, data aggregation, analytical tools for visualization and exploratory data mining, and a computational environment supporting predictive modeling capabilities NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The standard model of particle physics has been very successful in predicting how weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions behave up to energies so far accessible at present accelerators (1 TeV at the Tevatron at Fermilab in Chicago). However many fundamental questions are not addressed in the standard model and the standard model does not incorporate the fact that the neutrino, the lightest particle of spin 1/2, has a small mass. Two candidates for explaining some of the puzzles that exist are extending the standard model by doubling the number of particles via using a Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, which adds a particle of integer spin to every particle of 1/2 integer spin. Thus associated with the electron, which has spin 1/2, would be a scalar particle (0 spin) called the selectron. (This particle has not yet been found). Another approach is to assume our world is a lower dimensional surface (or membrane) in a higher dimensional space. This proposal by two groups, one at the Bartol Research Institute led by Qaisir Shafi and one at the Center for Theoretical Physics at the British University in Cairo, Dr. S. Khalil is to enable four Scientists from each institution to visit the other institution each year in order to foster their collaborative research on Large Hadron Collider related physics.  As further  glue  for the collaboration the proposal is for a Post-doc to be hired at the Center for Theoretical Physics to work full time on the proposed project.  The two teams will investigate both types of extensions of the standard model. This investigation is very important because next year at CERN in Geneva Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start operation and will hopefully find new phenomena that will suggest what the extensions of the Standard Model should be. Other ways of accessing the highest energies come from astrophysical observation of the cosmic background radiation, and by understanding the cosmological implications of extensions of the standard model. More specifically, this group of scientists intends to investigate supersymmetric extensions of the SM and their potential signatures at colliders, in Astrophysical observations and cosmological implications. In particular they intend to study the question of whether Supersymmetry can significantly modify the CP asymmetry in B-decays compared to the SM picture.  They also plan to perform a complete analysis for the minimal extension of the SM gauge symmetry that can accommodate the phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, which has been confirmed by many experiments.  The broader implications of this are many. The exchange of students will be an excellent cross-cultural experience for the students. Scientists trained in different cultures often have different ways of approaching solving a problem. The training of a young post-doc in Egypt who will interact strongly with the American scientists involved will enhance the training of this person and strengthen High Energy Physics research in Egypt. The partnership between the Physicists at Bartol and the Center for theoretical physics has been very fruitful in the past and its continuation would be very fruitful for advances in the field. This project is being supported by the U.S. Egypt Joint Board for Science and Technology which is funding both the U.S. and Egyptian sides of the collaboration NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Humans depend upon the world's natural ecosystems for vital goods and services, yet ecosystems are being degraded and destroyed at an unprecedented rate. Although the importance of ecosystem services is widely recognized, there is still considerable debate on how to calculate their true economic value. Resolution of this debate will require input from both ecologists and economists. This project will support collaboration between these two typically disparate fields by helping to fund a special issue of the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, a publication of the Ecological Society of America. Papers in this issue will analyze current schemes involving payments for ecosystem services and discuss concepts and theories about new ways to integrate and evaluate ecosystem services. The primary broader impact of this project will be the very widespread dissemination of the journal, in print to more than 10,000 members of the Ecological Society of America, and in electronic format via the ESA website and with collaboration with The Nature Conservancy NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Goals: North Dakota RII proposal will bring together people, tools, and ideas to lay the foundation for a durable, competitive and cutting edge research infrastructure with the primary focus on competitive research in renewable energy and flexible electronics and materials ? two areas of critical importance to North Dakota (ND). Intellectual Merit: New knowledge generated by this work will lead to greater understanding of issues at the core of problems in energy and microelectronics. The Flexible Electronic Materials (FlexEM) program has three major thrusts: 1) Barriers for Flexible Electronics; 2) Conjugated Organic Polymers for Flexible Electronics; and 3) Electronic Materials from Liquid Silanes. The proposed research aims at design, preparation, characterization, modeling, (and ultimately, prediction of behavior) of thin films and layered structures, which will enable flexible electronic technologies such as e-paper, photovoltaics, and health monitoring devices. SUstainable eNergy Research Infrastructure and Supporting Education (SUNRISE) program will elucidate fundamental aspects of heterogeneous catalysis, especially at the nanoscale, that are relevant to developing alternative transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks. Heterogeneous catalysts will be studied to gain knowledge about the electronic structure, surface morphology and defects, effects of doping and functionalization, redox properties, and finite size  effects. Catalysts that show potential for the synthesis of preferred organic compounds that can be exploited to produce fuels, chemicals, and polymer monomeric feedstocks will be of particular interest. Emphasis will be placed on studies of transition metal (e.g., Co, Pd, Pt) catalysts. Broader Impacts: The major underrepresented groups in North Dakota are Native Americans and women. Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education (NATURE) is a multifaceted program that greatly increases the involvement of our five Tribal Colleges in STEM education and research. The ND EPSCoR program also administers Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) to provide supplemental funding to women faculty for lab upgrades and additional research staff. ND EPSCoR also appropriates funding for Women in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (WISMET) a networking group that provides mentoring for women undergraduate/graduate students and women faculty. The involvement on the research university campus continues in the proposed program with commitments to four new tenure track faculty slots for the Flexem and SUNRISE initiatives. At least 50 new faculty will be hired in the broader STEM areas at University of North Dakota and NDSU NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Earth is unique among known planets in having liquid water on its surface, a crucial reason for the existence of life.  Explaining how this came to be, and predicting conditions friendly to life elsewhere requires understanding the protoplanetary disk from which Earth and the other planets formed, a complex, interacting system of rocks, dust, gas, plasma, and magnetic fields in orbit around the young Sun.  Many models by different scientific communities have addressed separate aspects of this problem, but none has integrated all the different physical, chemical, and mineralogical processes into a single, general, continuously improvable, three-dimensional, computational model.Our imminent entry into the petascale computing era makes such a model practical for the first time.  This project will be the first serious attempt to develop a complete, multi-physics model based on a global simulation of a protoplanetary disk.  We will include three major physical processes.  First is the turbulence driven by magnetic fields coupled to the partially ionized gas, which determines how fast the disk accretes onto the star and how well dust can stick together to form the building blocks of planets.   Second is the radiative cooling of the disk, which determines the temperature of the disk, and is determined by how dusty the disk is.  That, in turn, is controlled partly by the temperature.  Third, the gas chemistry and the temperature, as well as the dust properties, determine the ionization of the gas, which in turn determines how turbulent the disk is. All of these processes will be included in a common computational framework.  This framework will rely on a novel numerical algorithm for computing magnetized gas flows using simulated particles moving with the gas. This algorithm combines advantages and evades limitations of both traditional grid-based simulation codes and of more widely used particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Our team includes the inventor of this method.With a new, integrated model, we will be able to better understand Earth's position and properties, the properties of other Solar System objects, and observations of extrasolar planetary systems.The funding for this project will support the interdisciplinary training of a graduate student in the areas of meteoritics and astrophysics treated here.  A collaboration between the host institution and two European institutions will be supported, with graduate students traveling in both directions for collaboration and training. Three undergraduate students will also participate in this research.The research undertaken here will inform the exhibitions and education work of the PI and co-PI Ebel.  Currently, their projects include a new Hayden Planetarium Space Show (estimated international viewership 7 million over 5 years, including 0.5 million NYC school children), a photo exhibit on the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn, as well as extensive work with the professional development and community education departments of the Museum, and mentoring summer REU students and interns NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER FLIGHT VALIDATION OF METRICS DRIVEN ADAPTIVE CONTROL   The objective of the proposed effort is to develop a complete framework for the design and experimental validation of metrics driven adaptive control algorithms using unmanned platforms available at NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER UTILIZING THE NATIONAL NETWORK FOR VERIFICATION OF SATELLITE RAINFALL ESTIMATES This research proposal focuses on verification of satellite instantaneous precipitation products over a variety of climatic regimes for the purpose of assessing TRMM algorithm NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The C.A. Fredd Campus of Shelton State Community College, founded in 1963, is a small Historically Black College with a strong presence in West Alabama.  This HBCU-UP program is designed as a result of a thorough needs assessment that was supported through the use of an HBCU-UP planning grant.The proposed HBCU-UP project will establish a STEM institute on the C.A. Fredd campus of Shelton State Community College, which has an overall aim of strengthening current STEM programs.  Six components comprise the Institute:  i) high school component; ii) undergraduate student activities; iii) infusion of technology; iv) curricular enhancement; v) faculty development activities and vi) transition to four year college, and subsequently to graduate school.  The implementation project is a continuum that begins with the high school component, strengthens the 2-year STEM curriculum at the college, and then encourage and facilitate entrance into 4-year STEM programs.Activities that will be a part of the STEM Institute include:  a six week, intensive High School Summer Institute for rising seniors, and incoming college freshmen; professional development for high school STEM teachers; well defined faculty-student mentoring supported by professional development activities for faculty; implementation of undergraduate student research and summer internships; technology enhancement in STEM courses; and course restructuring aimed at gatekeeper courses.  The transition to four year institutions will be encouraged and enhanced by student participation in research with faculty from four year colleges and Ph.D. granting institutions.  This is further facilitated by a statewide transfer articulation agreement within Alabama.This comprehensive project is aimed at increasing the number of C.A. Fredd campus students successfully completing introductory and advanced DTEM courses, increase academic performance in these courses; increase the number of students participating in research and internship activities, and increase the number of students gaining admission to 4-year STEM degree programs NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award seeks to build upon prior RII-supported efforts to expand the core facilities of the University?s Center of Excellence in Marine and Environmental Studies. At this center, scientists investigate the connections between ocean and coastal waters; the biological and geophysical linkages of the land-sea interface; and their potential impact on coral reef ecosystems. Specifically, this project will investigate the factors that enhance or reduce coral reefs? tolerance to environmental stress to better understand ecological resilience. The people of the Virgin Islands rely heavily on   Caribbean coastal resources for subsistence, and are alarmed by findings that indicate that nearly 70% of the coral reefs are threatened by costal development, pollution, sedimentation, and over-fishing.  Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification and ineffective management add further threats to Caribbean coral reefs.Project Major Foci: Because of the US Virgin Islands? reliance on the surrounding coastal waters and coral reef ecosystems for tourism (economic engine), transportation, food and recreation, the research focus is Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs. Three research projects have been developed into the Integrated Caribbean Coastal Ecosystem Research Plan: 1) Evolutionary and Ecological Patterns and Processes team will investigate the numerous processes that threaten coral reef ecosystems; 2) Ocean and Coastal Processes team will provide the physical foundation for interpreting biological processes based upon field data and ocean modeling; and 3) Environmental Analysis and Management team will address the gap between physical and human interactions in coastal ecosystems and the underlying importance of socio-economics on successful natural resource management.Intellectual MeritThe project will investigate factors that enhance or reduce a coral reef?s tolerance to environmental stress and the coral reef?s resistance to transitions to alternate ecological states. Anticipated project outcomes include a better understanding of how ecological patterns and processes are influenced by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Broader ImpactsThe research outcomes will inform decision-makers on natural resource management and spatial planning and will enhance human and ocean health. There is an urgent need for this information given the trends on coral reef mortality in the region and the potential negative impact to the region?s economy.  Research results may be applicable to regions outside the Caribbean NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER IYA KEPLER MISSION PRE-LAUNCH WORKSHOPS The purpose of the workshop is to enhance the content knowledge and inquiry-based teaching skills for middle and high school science teachers / to prepare them to connect their classroom instruction to NASA's Kepler NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER PI: Christopher G. Taylor (Donald Danforth Plant Science Center)coPIs: Lauren McIntyre, Karen E. Koch (University of Florida; subawardee)Intellectual Merit:  The aim of this project is to define and characterize genes important in the development and function of transfer cells.  Transfer cells facilitate the mass movement of sugars and amino acids from extracellular spaces to the inside of plant cells.  For example, transfer cells are formed in endosperm tissues where assimilates are transferred from maternal tissues to the developing seed. Certain biotrophic interactions are also known to induce the formation of cells with similar function.  Root-knot nematodes induce the formation of multinucleated cells, called giant cells, which serve as the exclusive source of nematode nutrition.  Due to their functional similarities, transfer cells from seeds and nematode-induced giant cells share many of the same morphological characteristics including thickened and highly invaginated cell walls, dense cytoplasm, abundant ER, and numerous small vacuoles and mitochondria.  Cells with transfer cell-like function are eminent objects of scientific interest since their activity involves a number of poorly understood molecular and cytological transport processes and they are crucial for the survival of both plants and specific biotrophic plant pathogens.  Using laser capture microdissection, the transcriptome of transfer cells from developing seeds and from nematode-induced giant cells of Arabidopsis and maize will be examined for genes involved in transfer cell development and function.  Genes unique and common to endosperm transfer cells and giant cells will be examined for their patterns of expression during plant development and nematode infestation.  Sub-cellular localization of proteins will aid in assigning the role of proteins to transfer cell functions.  T-DNA insertion lines (Arabidopsis) and transposon tagged lines (maize) will be used to examine the function of genes (and the proteins they encode) during seed development or nematode parasitism.  Molecular and biochemical analysis of Arabidopsis and maize mutants will provide additional information on the role of transfer cells in assimilate movement.  All research materials will be cataloged and described on a project website (http://www.danforthcenter.org/taylor/) and made available to the research community.  These experiments will provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of giant and transfer cell function and will be of high practical relevance given the importance of root-knot nematodes as plant pathogens and the importance of transfer cells in the formation of seed, fruit and/or biomass. Broader Impacts:  Three approaches to broadening the impact of science will be provided in this project.  First, summer undergraduate interns will get involved in the project through the summer REU internship program at the Danforth Center.  This program is dedicated to fostering an interest and understanding in basic science among students with an emphasis on the recruitment of underrepresented minorities.  Secondly, we will provide summer teacher fellowships through a Research Education for Teachers (RET) program.  The participating science teacher benefits from the knowledge and experience provided by working in an active laboratory.   Thirdly, this project will develop several DNA Microarray Traveling Trunks that teach high school students about microarrays and their uses.   High school science teachers will be trained to use the trunk and develop and administer lesson plans based on microarray technology.   The Trunk program will incorporate lesson plans, equipment, materials, online resources and hands-on student activities to demonstrate the principals of microarrays.  The Trunks will be shared among the school districts, reaching a diverse array of students across the St. Louis and surrounding areas NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER A grant has been awarded to Smith College under the supervision of Dr. Michael J. Barresi and Co-PI, Dr. Richard Briggs to acquire high-resolution microscopy for research in live cell imaging. The Center for Microscopy and Imaging at Smith will house the NSF supported acquisition of Leica?s SP5 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope with live cell imaging capabilities. Researchers at Smith College, as well as the other institutions participating in the Five College Consortium (Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts), will enter a new frontier of biological research, studying molecules, cells and tissues in the living state. The remarkable flexibility of this confocal microscope will support a diverse array of research topics that represent three unifying themes of investigation based on scale: the study of specific molecular mechanisms; understanding unicellular structure, function and behavior; and analysis of whole organism development and physiology. The proposed instrumentation will directly impact the research programs of 18 faculty from the Five Colleges listed above as well as an estimated 30 graduate students and 80 undergraduates.Smith College is the nation?s largest liberal arts college for women and is among the top schools producing the greatest number of woman pursuing careers in science. Therefore, one of the main purposes of this newly funded instrumentation will be training highly motivated, diverse undergraduates, many from underrepresented groups, including first-generation college students. This modern microscope system will also serve as a focal point for various outreach activities to area schools and summer science programs targeting young women from underrepresented minority groups. Lastly, because of the strong Five College support for this instrument, this confocal microscope will be an important catalyst for inter-college collaborations that would not typically develop. Such interactions can help stimulate new directions and open doors for students to pursue careers in science and research. Because this instrumentation will provide whole new levels of analysis previously unavailable, the most exciting impacts will probably be those scientific findings that cannot even be predicted NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The project proposes to integrate NSF-funded efforts at the University of Washington (UW) in an innovative way to improve the experiences of underrepresented undergraduate minorities, women and students with disabilities in the College of Engineering.  A primary catalyst for this synergy is the use of the UW's PEERs project (Promoting Equity in Engineering Relationships), which seeks to positively impact the climate of engineering through a cadre of change agents who create and encourage improved and more equitable relationships. The four institutional partners for the proposed collaboration are the institution's:1. ADVANCE Center for Institutional Change;2. Center for Workforce Development;3. Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching (CELT); and4. Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology (DO-IT).These institutional partners will use the PEERs model to enhance the goals of three NSF-funded projects and to leverage lessons learned from the existing awards to work toward improving the climate for and the participation of underrepresented minority, female and disabled engineering students; and provide a foundation for campus-wide replication.  The three NSF awards upon which the I3 project will build include:1. Collaborative Research - Northwest Engineering Talent Expansion Partnership: A Coordinated Regional Recruitment and Retention Effort (DUE-0431659);2. CCLI: Developing Engineering Lifelong Learners Through Freshman Seminars and Faculty Development Workshops (DUE-0737535); and 3. Northwest Alliance for Access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (HRD-0227995).Four primary objectives will be achieved by this project 1. Raise awareness of unconscious and implicit biases toward underrepresented minority, women and disabled students; 2. Promote actions both majority and underrepresented minority, women and disabled students and faculty can take to counteract these biases to cultivate a more welcoming and success-promoting climate; 3. Cultivate change agents among both student and faculty bodies; and 4. Build a foundation, and collaboration mechanisms, for future efforts to make STEM and other programs campus-wide welcoming and accessible to underrepresented minority, women and disabled students NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a novel fiber sensor based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using metal nanostructures for chemical, biological, and environmental detection.  The approach is to integrate 1) novel nanoparticle substrates that provide the high sensitivity and consistency, molecular specificity, and applicability to a wide range of compounds; 2) a unique hollow core optical fiber probe with double SERS substrate structure that provides the compactness, reliability, low cost, and ease of sampling; and 3) an innovative matched spectral filter set that provides automatic preliminary molecule identification. The intellectual merit is to eliminate some of the existing road blocks for the practical applications of current SERS sensors. The novel sensor developed is a transformative technology since its unique capabilities will help revolutionize the way chemical and biological detection is conducted, with potential single molecule detection capability.  This in turn will impact many aspects of human lives, ranging from medicine and national security to food safety and to chemical and environmental industries.The broader impacts are to maintain the competitive edge of the US through the multidisciplinary education and training of students in the fast growing fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology.  Promotion of diversity is focused on the encouragement and recruitment of women in science and engineering, with the PI as a role model.  Outreach to local and Bay Area K-12 schools will involve high school students to participate in the research and inspire children to be future scientists and engineers NEW_ABSTRACT_MARKER The Division of Chemistry supports Andrea Munro of the University of Arizona as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow.  Dr. Munro will synthesize and study the properties of semiconductor nanocrystals (CdSe) embedded in a polymer matrix.  Dr. Munro will work in collaboration with scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  In her plan for broadening participation, Dr. Munro will develop hands-on materials with associated curriculum to be used by teachers of grades K-6 in the Tucson and Sunnyside school districts.  Some of these materials may be modified for use in the University of Arizona Biosphere II for outreach to the general public.Research like that of Dr. Munro is aimed at developing better materials for photovoltaic devices with improved properties, as well as developing a better understanding of how these materials behave.  The ultimate aim of research like this is to develop better materials for solar energy applications.  The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Munro are aimed at increasing the participation of young people from underrepresented groups in the sciences\""
