      "Land-use change is a primary driver of the losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services at local to global scales (Foley et al. 2005). Developing spatially explicit projections of land-use change and their consequences has thus emerged as one of the eight grand challenges in environmental science (Clark et al. 2001; Harte 2001; National Research Council 2001). Yet our ability to forecast land-use change has been limited by the availability of spatial data and our understanding of nonlinear threshold responses in economic and ecological systems (Nilsson et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2000). For example, LANDSAT satellite imagery is commonly used to classify land-cover change from urban and agricultural uses; however, it does not detect low-density exurban development. This is important to consider because exurban development uses a great deal more land than both urban and suburban development (Heimlich and Anderson 2001). Exurban development therefore poses the greater challenge to farmland preservation efforts and has caused significant reductions in the survival of many native species (Hansen et al. 2005). To mitigate these impacts, it is important to understand what factors influence the spatial pattern of land-use development. In particular, it is essential to analyze the role of land-use policies and infrastructure planning on guiding future development patterns and the expected ecological outcomes. Additionally, human activities related to land use and water management have major impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Harding et al. 1998). As urban and agricultural development expands, it has caused reductions in stream flows and water quality. This has contributed to high numbers of endangered aquatic species and the decline of economically valuable fisheries, such as anadromous salmonids (Richter et al. 1997). Likewise, the federal listing of endangered species can trigger instream flow requirements that reduce water security for irrigated agriculture and other uses. Therefore, there is a need to develop spatial economic models to understand the joint decisions on land-use development and water management. This would be a first step to an integrated spatially explicit economic and hydrologic model in order to improve water supply security for rural landowners and the instream flows needed to sustain aquatic ecosystems.\n",
      "Land-use change is a primary driver of the losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services at local to global scales (Foley et al. 2005). Developing spatially explicit projections of land-use change and their consequences has thus emerged as one of the eight grand challenges in environmental science (Clark et al. 2001; Harte 2001; National Research Council 2001). Yet our ability to forecast land-use change has been limited by the availability of spatial data and our understanding of nonlinear threshold responses in economic and ecological systems (Nilsson et al. 2003; Wu et al. 2000). For example, LANDSAT satellite imagery is commonly used to classify land-cover change from urban and agricultural uses; however, it does not detect low-density exurban development. This is important to consider because exurban development uses a great deal more land than both urban and suburban development (Heimlich and Anderson 2001). Exurban development therefore poses the greater challenge to farmland preservation efforts and has caused significant reductions in the survival of many native species (Hansen et al. 2005). To mitigate these impacts, it is important to understand what factors influence the spatial pattern of land-use development. In particular, it is essential to analyze the role of land-use policies and infrastructure planning on guiding future development patterns and the expected ecological outcomes. Additionally, human activities related to land use and water management have major impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Harding et al. 1998). As urban and agricultural development expands, it has caused reductions in stream flows and water quality. Therefore, there is a need to develop spatial economic models to understand the influence of policies on urban development patterns and hydrologic and nutrient cycles.\n"

From intensive exchanges on the implications of current research to familyfriendly sessions on stress management, this conference addresses a wide range ofimportant Fragile X-related public health and research topics. Distinctive in its personalapproach and sensitivity to families, the conference is organized around dozens ofscientific and family-friendly sessions. Topics are organized and selected to reflect theexpressed needs and interests of families. thThis 11 International Conference will be the first since the establishment of the FragileX Clinics Consortium. Formed in 2006 by the NFXF, the Fragile X Clinics Consortiumserves a number of public health needs, including the development of a knowledge basefor treatment of difficult cases and the establishment of a structure for collaborativeresearch and implementation efforts, including drug trials and public health surveillance.The geographic proximity of existing Fragile X Clinics to the CDC's Centers for Autismand Developmental Disabilities, Research and Epidemiology (CADDRE) and Autism andDevelopmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network provide an ideal foundationupon which to develop and deliver a comprehensive and organized approach toaddressing the public health needs of the Fragile X Community.Among the objectives of the conference are improved intervention for both families andprofessionals, and addressing Fragile X-related public health initiatives by broadeningand strengthening support for families. Approximately 1000 combined guests andspeakers will attend the conference. Twenty-five members of the NFXF's Scientific andClinical Advisory Committee, who themselves have been elected based on their provenexpertise as FX researchers or clinicians, will comprise the planning group forprofessional-focused sessions. They will join a group of staff and board members in theselection of family-friendly session. A comprehensive outreach and registration process,including the identification of families with financial need and underrepresented families,will be initiated through NFXF's network of family groups. Conference registration willbe accomplished by mail or electronically months in advance of the conference. TheCADDRE and ADDM Network, in conjunction with the Fragile X Clinics Consortium,will play a critical role in the structured dissemination and replication of conferenceobjectives. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation and continuous improvement planwill be in place to measure all aspects of the conference and inform future conferences.Project Narrative File(s)FileName MimeType6566-Mandatory_2007_CDC_Proposal_Narrative.pdf application/pdfTracking Number: GRANT00387973\""

       "\"Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):      Rajewsky, KlaUSAbstract for Research Plan Extension Period    Maintaining the overall title of the grant, the focus of the work will shift to later phases of B cell development,reaching from the naive, mature B cell to the germinal center (GC) reaction and memory B cell generation, maintenanceand response. In addition, while we expect to bring the analysis of the role of BCR specificity in the formation andmaintenance of the Bl and B2 subsets to completion within the first funding period, we expect that the experimentsproposed for the extension period will further contribute to the understanding of this problem by identifying criticalintracellular signaling cascades.    Our work in the first funding period has demonstrated that the maintenance of mature B cells requires, apart from anNFicB-mediated signal through the BAFF-R (Sasaki et al., 2006), a maintenance signal through the BCR, involving theIgo/p cytoplasmic tail (Kraus et al., 2004). However, the molecular nature of this signal has remained undefined. Aim 1of our proposal for the extension period attempts to clarify this issue, using targeted mutagenesis of the ITAMmotifs in the cytoplasmic tails of the Igct/p heterodimer in combination, conditional inactivation of the phosphataseSHP-1, and a combined genetic conditional gain- and loss-of-function approach, in which the BCR isconditionallyablated in mature B cells, together with the activation of candidate intracellular signaling pathways like PI3 andMAP kinase signaling. We have generated vectors encoding constitutively active components of these pathwaysand are in the process of targeting them into the ROSA26 locus, according to a strategy, which we have developedfor the induction of constitutive NFicB signaling (Sasaki et al., 2006). This part of the project connects our work tothe areas of B cell subset differentiation as well as the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas, where the activation ofcertain signalingpathways plays a critical role.     Aim 2 addressesthe role of BCR signaling in T-independent and -dependentB cell activation and in particular the GCreaction. Our work before and in the present funding period (Kraus et al., 2001;Patterson et al., 2006) has establishedthat conserved ITAM and non-ITAM tyrosines in the Iga cytoplasmic tail play distinct roles in T-dependent and-independent B cell activation. While our analysis of the non-ITAM tyrosines has come to a conclusion, the ITAMtyrosines appear to play an as yet enigmatic dual role, in that in combination with the Ig(3 ITAM they appear be crucial forBCR signaling altogether (Gazumyan et al., 2006; Kraus et al., 2001), whereas their mutation by themselves results in Bcell hyper-reactivity upon BCR cross-linking. We hypothesize that the Iga ITAM tyrosines are essential for BCRsignal-initiation as well as -termination, and that the former function is redundant with the ITAM tyrosines ofIgp\\\\Accordingly, our experiments aim at the identification of a negative feedback loop targeting the Iga ITAMtyrosines in BCR signal termination, using a biochemical approach with subsequent genetic verification. We willalso assess a possible role of the Iga ITAM in antigen presentation, given the reduced T-dependent  response of Bcells harboring a mutated Iga ITAM (Kraus et al., 2001). Using GC B cell-specific gene targeting (Casola et al.,2006) and the various conditional alleles we have generated, we will assess the role of the Iga/p* heterodimer and itsITAMs and of BAFF-R in the control of the GC reaction in vivo.     Aim 3 addressesthe role of BCR signaling in the maintenance and responsiveness to antigenic challenge of memory Bcells, an issue that has remained largely unexplored in the past. We will address this issue using a cell transfer system,which we have recently established and which allows the selective tracing of genetically labeled memory B cells in vivo,together with conditional alleles of components of the BCR and systems of inducible gene targeting, which we haveestablished in the past. On this basis, we will assess the role BCR expression and signaling as well as of BAFF-R inmemory B cell maintenance. A particular focus will be on the relative contributions of the Iga/p heterodimer onthe one hand and the cytoplasmic tails of IgH chains of y subclasses on the other, given that the BCRs of mostmemory B cells carry IgH chains with extended cytoplasmic tails, in contrast to the BCRs expressed by naive Bcells. We have already constructed mouse mutants expressing Igyl chains or Ign chains with a y2b cytoplasmic tailinstead of Igm chains, and are in the process of generating a conditionalallele allowing Cre recombinase-mediatedreplacement of an lygl chain by a genetically labeled tailless mutant. Finally, if memory B cell maintenance willturn out to be BCR dependent, we will use the combined gain- and loss-of-function approach described underAims 1 and 2 to identify signalingpathways downstream of the BCR that contribute to cellular maintenance.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006)                                               Page     2                                                                              Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):     RaJGWSky, KlausTable of ContentsFace  Page                                                                                                                                                                                 1Abstract                                                                                                                                                                                       2Table of Contents                                                                                                        3Detailed Budget                                                                                                                                                                     4Entire Budget/Budget Justification                                                                    5-7Principal Investigator's Biosketch                                                              8-11Progress Report                                                                                                                                                                 12-38Checklist                                                                                                                                                                                  39AppendixPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006)                                           Page   3                                                                         Continuation Format Page\""

      "Fenway Community Health (FCH), a Boston community-health center, which has conducted HIV/AIDS research for more than two decades, proposes to establish a Clinical Trials Unit (based on its experience coordinating HIVNET and HPTN consortia), which has been invited to be affiliated with two HIV/AIDS Clinical Trial Leadership Groups: Prevention of HIV (HPTN) and Microbicides (MTN). FCH will oversee the Administrative Component of the CTU and will coordinate the activities of three Clinical Research Sites in southeastern New England including: FCH, Latin American Health Institute (LHI, Boston, MA) and The Miriam Hospital (TMH, Providence, Rl). The CTU proposes to enroll a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of participants in the following protocols: 1. to reduce HIV seroincidence in cocaine and stimulant users (N=250); 2. to assess the efficacy of novel antiretrovirals for pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV transmission (250); 3. to decrease HIV incidence in IDU with buprenorphine (150); 4. to assess and develop interventions for individuals acutely infected with HIV (100); 5. to enroll high risk women in microbicide preparedness studies (100); 6. to assess oral versus topical tenofovir (20); 6. to evaluate a novel microbicide (20); 7. to compare a new microbicide with a placebo gel in a Phase II study (40); 8. to enroll high risk women in a Phase III study (200); 9. to enroll recently infected trial participants into observational studies (over 90% of newly infected patients). All 3 CRSs have worked together in the HPTN, enrolling distinctive populations of at risk and HIV-infected people, with FCH focusing on MSM, LHI on Latinos, and TMH on women. The current proposal demonstrates the ability of each CRS to increase and diversify its ability to enroll relevant populations for these trials. Each CRS has the infrastructure necessary for the conduct of effective and ethical trials, including well-trained, GCP-compliant staff; clinical and laboratory resources, experience with data collection, transmittal, and analysis; IRBs with FWAs; independent community advisory boards. The leadership of the CTU and participating CRS has worked together on multiple USPHS -funded research protocols, and demonstrate in this proposal the mechanisms to optimize the complementary strengths of the collaborative investigators, including experience working with diverse populations, plans for maximal efficiency in resource utilization, and mentoring of new investigators.

      "Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):      Rajewsky, KlaUSAbstract for Research Plan Extension Period    Maintaining the overall title of the grant, the focus of the work will shift to later phases of B cell development,reaching from the naive, mature B cell to the germinal center (GC) reaction and memory B cell generation, maintenanceand response. In addition, while we expect to bring the analysis of the role of BCR specificity in the formation andmaintenance of the Bl and B2 subsets to completion within the first funding period, we expect that the experimentsproposed for the extension period will further contribute to the understanding of this problem by identifying criticalintracellular signaling cascades.    Our work in the first funding period has demonstrated that the maintenance of mature B cells requires, apart from anNFicB-mediated signal through the BAFF-R (Sasaki et al., 2006), a maintenance signal through the BCR, involving theIgo/p cytoplasmic tail (Kraus et al., 2004). However, the molecular nature of this signal has remained undefined. Aim 1of our proposal for the extension period attempts to clarify this issue, using targeted mutagenesis of the ITAMmotifs in the cytoplasmic tails of the Igct/p heterodimer in combination, conditional inactivation of the phosphataseSHP-1, and a combined genetic conditional gain- and loss-of-function approach, in which the BCR isconditionallyablated in mature B cells, together with the activation of candidate intracellular signaling pathways like PI3 andMAP kinase signaling. We have generated vectors encoding constitutively active components of these pathwaysand are in the process of targeting them into the ROSA26 locus, according to a strategy, which we have developedfor the induction of constitutive NFicB signaling (Sasaki et al., 2006). This part of the project connects our work tothe areas of B cell subset differentiation as well as the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas, where the activation ofcertain signalingpathways plays a critical role.     Aim 2 addressesthe role of BCR signaling in T-independent and -dependentB cell activation and in particular the GCreaction. Our work before and in the present funding period (Kraus et al., 2001;Patterson et al., 2006) has establishedthat conserved ITAM and non-ITAM tyrosines in the Iga cytoplasmic tail play distinct roles in T-dependent and-independent B cell activation.

      "The broad objective of this grant proposal is to study the mechanisms responsible for the fidelity of DMAsynthesis. DMA polymerases are the key enzymes involved in replication and repair of DMA. An analysis ofhow polymerases control fidelity is central to understanding the biochemical basis of a wide variety of geneticdiseases. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and ADA deficiency are two examples of inherited childhood diseases thatcan arise from a single point mutation. Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genesleading to cancer can result from single base changes in DNA. Genetic defects in post-replication mismatchrepair of DNA polymerase errors are a root cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colin cancer, along with a varietyof other types of cancer. Previous fidelity studies have focused on individual DNA polymerases in the absenceof polymerase accessory proteins required to sustain processive synthesis. This grant investigates the fidelityof purified procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA polymerase holoenzymes, pol III and pol IIfrom Escherichia coli, andpol delta from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A thorough understanding of fidelity mechanisms of DNApolymerases requires an analysis of the effects of sequence context and replication assessory proteins onfidelity. The proposed experiments, which include a full complement of polymerase subunits, are among thefirst of its kind, and make use of a mathematical model of polymerase fidelity and a gel fidelity assay that we'vedeveloped previously. The model is used to predict the effect of polymerase processivity subunits on basesubstitution fidelity. These predictions will be tested experimentally. Steady state kinetic experiments aredesigned to investigate the biochemical basis of mutational  hot  and  cold  spots. We propose to test theimportance of hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick base pairs on polymerase fidelity, by measuring theeffects of base stacking on polymerase fidelity, in the absence of hydrogen bonding. Presteady state kineticexperiments, using fluorescent nucleotide analogs, are proposed to measure switching between polymeraseand exonuclease active sites in  real-time . A second set of presteady state experiments are designed todetermine the mechanism for loading and unloading the polymerase processivity clamp subunit onto DNA and toanalyze the requirements for ATP hydrolysis for each step in the clamp-loading pathway. This pathway isrequired for Okazaki fragment formation during discontinuous lagging-strand DNA synthesis.PERFORMANCE SIT t(S) (organization, city, state)University of Southern CaliforniaDepartment of Biological SciencesUniversity ParkLos Angeles, CA 90089-1340KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) includes a constellation of symptoms and deficits in social behavior has become acknowledged as possibly one of the most debilitating symptoms. However,the behavioral and neural mechanism giving rise to the social deficits seen in FASD and the degreeto which the environment plays a role in these social deficits remains unknown. Thus, theenvironment of alcohol-exposed pups will be modified such that they are exposed to intensive norma social interactions during development, isolation during the juvenile period, and abnormal mothering behavior in order to examine mitigating or exacerbating factors in the social deficits. Interactions of environment will be examined across different doses of alcohol, with the prediction that effects of low doses of alcohol will be more sensitive to environmental manipulations. Based on evidence from this laboratory and others, it is hypothesized that the ethanol-induced social deficits might arise from changes in mu opioid system. This hypothesis is examined using autoradiography and microinjectior techniques. Behavioral analyses of the social deficits observed in animals exposed to alcohol during development has demonstrated that the deficits are not likely due to changes in social motivationanc some evidence suggests that there are deficits in the ability to process social cues. The social response of animals to different gradations of sensory cues and the ability to detect social cues inthe olfactory, auditory and somatosensory domains will be examined. Using the additive factors method, the contribution of deficits in social cue processing to social deficits in general in ethanol-exposed animals will be determined. c-Fos immunoreactivity will be used to examine the neural structures contributing to the sensory processing deficit. The rat model of FASD used in this proposal entails exposure during both the prenatal and postnatal period, mimicking the effect of alcohol exposure during all three trimesters in the humans.FASD continues to be a public health problem occurring large expenses both to society and theindividual. The proposed studies will use a rat model of FASD to delineate the behavioral andneurobiological mechanism underlying the social deficits in this disorder and the contribution ofsocial environments to the impact of ethanol during development. These findings can then betranslated into both biological and behavioral treatments for FASD.

      "This is a proposal for a new investigator R03 to lay the groundwork for a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral treatment to reduce sexual risk taking in men who have sex with men (MSM) who abuse crystal methamphetamine (crystal meth), and are at risk for HIV acquisition. The treatment will incorporate state of the art behavioral risk reduction counseling approaches (e.g. information-motivation-behavioral skills building, IMB; Fisher & Fisher, 1992; Fisher & Fisher, 1993) with behavioral activation therapy to treat depression (a moderator in the IMB model). Behavioral activation is a treatment of depression that focuses on helping individuals reengage in their life (Martell, 2001, 2002). We chose this strategy for MSM who abuse crystal meth because our formative qualitative work revealed that many MSM who abuse crystal meth become unable to enjoy activities that they had previously enjoyed. This lack of enjoyment in activities that do not involve crystal meth use and / or sex contributes to the motivation for continued crystal use and potentially unsafe sex. While the main outcome of the intervention will be to reduce sexual risk taking, additional outcomes will be reduced crystal meth use and reduced depression. The first 6-months will be an intervention development phase, and the next year and a half will be a pilot of the intervention among 20 HIV-uninfected MSM. The study will allow us to demonstrate participant acceptance, ability to recruit, feasibility of treatment delivery with therapists, and clinically significant participant improvement. It will allow for further evaluation of the feasibility of all study procedures, adaptation of the treatment manual, and will provide pilot data for a power analysis for an initial randomized controlled trial. These goals are consistent with NIH guidelines for a stage model of psychosocial treatment development (Rounsaville et al., 2001).  Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Mimiaga, Matthew Project Narrative Crystal meth abuse and dependence is a complex and treatment resistant-problem. One potential cause of its intractability may be that treatments focus on reducing crystal use without emphasizing replacement activities. Based on our formative work, MSM who abuse crystal may have stopped getting pleasure from previously enjoyed activities that do not involve crystal use. Behavioral activation therapy (Martell, Addis, & Jacobson, 2001) is a valid treatment of depression that involves identifying and actively engaging pleasurable events. To our knowledge, an approach that integrates behavioral activation with HIV risk reduction counseling has not yet been studied among men who have sex with men (MSM) who abuse crystal meth.\n",

Recent studies from our group indicated that gut-derived myocardialdepressant factors carried in intestinal lymph trigger myocardial contractile depression. In addition, ourpreliminary studies demonstrated that the physiologically relevant concentrations of mesenteric lymphcollected from rats receiving 40 % burn injury (burn lymph), but not lymph from sham-burned rats (controllymph), to ventricular myocytes isolated from healthy rats leads to a significant alterations in action potentialduration associated with disturbed Ca2+homeostasis. In other preliminary work, we have found that burnlymph increases myocyte size, mitogen-activated protein kinases and cell death of cultured neonatal ratventricular myocytes after 24 hrs incubation, suggesting a common mechanistic link between burn traumaand hypertrophic heart disease. In this proposal, we will capitalize on these discoveries and propose tofurther investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in burn-induced myocardial dysfunctionand the roles of burn lymph in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To begin understanding thecellular basis for altered myocardial function, this proposal focuses on cellular mechanisms important formyocardial Ca2+ homeostasis. Wehypothesize that 1)burn injury-inducedLV dysfunction issecondaryto gut-derived factor(s) contained in mesenteric lymph (burn lymph), and 2)changes in ioniccurrents and Ca2 -cyclingproteins caused by burn lymph areinvolvedin burn-inducedLVdysfunction and ultimately to heart failure (HF). To test the hypothesis, this grant proposal also includesgenomics and protein chemistry to elucidate valuable information in the heart after burn injury. This researchis fundamental to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of burn-related myocardial dysfunction. Abetter understanding of molecular etiology and downstream mechanisms could lead to improved therapeuticmeasures to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with burn injury.UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Yatani, AtSUko, Ph.D.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The long-term goal of this project is to discover novel types of broad-spectrum antibioticscapable of effectively eradicating a wide range of potential biowarfare agents, as well asconventional pathogens. In this phase of the project, we will develop a high-throughput screen for atargeted discovery of prodrug antibiotics. The screen is aimed at solving the following problems thathave impeded antimicrobial drug discovery: automatically eliminate a high background of generally-toxic molecules in compound library screening; obtain lead compounds with good penetration intoGram negative species, indicative of a broad spectrum of activity; and an ability to sterilize aninfection by eliminating persister cells invulnerable to all current antibiotics. Prodrugs such as metronidazole convert inside the cell into a reactive molecule that hits multipletargets. In this regard, an activated prodrug acts like an antiseptic. Our preliminary data show thatprodrugs can potentially completely sterilize a stationary state population of E.co//containingpersisters. An ability to sterilize an infection can be critically important for treatingimmunocompromised individuals and multidrug tolerant biofilms that cause 65% of all infectiousdiseases in developed countries. An activated prodrug will bind covalently to its targets, creating anirreversible sink which will allow it to avoid efflux by MDR pumps of Gram negative species which isthe main obstacle in developing broad-spectrum antibiotics. We will use E.'coli,.including the O157:H7 enterohemorrhagic strain that is a Category Bwaterborne agent in screen development. The process will include test strainconstruction-screening at the National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence inBiodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases facility in Boston and at an NIH Screening Center,and validation of hits to indicate their prodrug nature. This research will lead to the development of new antibiotics with a broad spectrum of actionthat will be effective against both bioweapons agents such as Y.pestis, F. tularensis and B.anthracis, and conventional pathogens. The uniquely novel property of these compounds will betheir ability to completely sterilize an infection, preventing relapse of a disease and enablingeffective treatment of immunodeficient individuals, including the elderly and the very young.PERFORMANCE,SITE(S) (organization, city, state) ,Northeastern Mniversity, Boston, MANational Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and EmergingInfectious Diseases, Boston, MAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Lewis, KimKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This renewal applicationis focusedon three aspectsin the development of novel geneticallyengineeredmucosal immunogensconstructedprimarily from a saliva-bindingregion (SBR)of surfaceprotein AgYII ofStreptococcus mutuns and a nontoxiccomponentof choleratoxin (CT),the A2/B subunits,as potentialcandidatesfor inclusion in a vaccine againstdental caries. SpecificAim 1will addressthe mechanismsunderlyingimmunologicalmemory that maintains long-term and recallablesalivaryIgA antibodyresponseswhen SBR-CTA2A3is administeredto mice by the intranasalroute, which has previously been shown to beparticularlyeffective for inducingthese responses. The followingwill be investigated:the generation andcharacteristsicsof antigen-specificmemory B and T cells, and the cytokinesthey produce,in the nasallymphoid tissue and the cervical lymph nodes that drain it; the ability of these cells to serve as precursorsofIgA antibody-secretingcells in salivaryglands;and the uptake and retention of antigenby these tissues.SpecificAim 2 will develop and refine furthermucosal immunogensbased on the sametechnology, toimprove the production and immunologicalproperties of SBR-CTA2/B,to construct and evaluateimmunogensfrom other segmentsof AgI/II that may be importantfor protection againstdental caries, and toevaluatethe use of similar immunogensconstructedfrom S. mutuns glucosyltransferase. The immunogenswill be evaluated for their immunogenicityin terms of the salivary IgA and serum antibodiesinduced in micewhen administeredby the intragastricand intranasalroutes. SpecificAim 3 will determinethe ability of SBR-CTA2A3 to induce salivary IgA and serumantibody responsesto S. mutuns AgmI in adult human volunteersimmunizedorally or intranasallywith this immunogen. This is planned as a small-scale,preclinicalexperiment,that takes advantageof the known safety and immunogenicity of CTB itself when administeredtohumans by these routes, and the previously demonstratedability of CTB to serve as a carrier for other proteinantigenscoupled to it either chemicallyorgenetically when these are administeredto experimental animalsbyoral orintranasalroutes. The informationobtained will permit clinicaltrials to be proposed for the evaluationof these and similarimmunogensas vaccinesagainst dentalcaries, and demonstratethe utility of thistechnology for inducing mucosal immuneresponsesthat may be applicableagainstother human infections.'ERFORMANCE SITE@) (organization,city, state) University of Alabama at Birmingham,Birmingham, AlabamaKEY PERSONNEL.

      "CBET-0801375    Title: Travel Grant related to a Research Proposal Writing Tutorial for the NSF Workshop at the November 2007 AIChE Annual MeetingPI:  James M LeeInstitution: Washington State UniversityThis is an individual travel grant that provides  funds for the principal investigator (PI) to work with a NSF program officer, Dr. John Regalbuto, to help prepare a presentation and participate in the  Proposal Writing Tutorial  for the NSF Workshop to be held at the 2007 AIChE Annual Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah (November 4-9, 2007). For over 25 years, the Division of Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and Transport System (CBET) has held workshops at the AIChE Annual Meeting to introduce individual programs and NSF-wide initiatives, explain organizational changes, and provide opportunities for interactive communication between program directors and faculty. This year, CBET has changed the workshop format to include the  Proposal Writing Tutorial,  and  Interactive Breakout Panels of NSF Program Directors.  The PI has been asked to work with a NSF program officer to help prepare, present, and evaluate a  Proposal Writing Tutorial.  The requested budget includes travel expenses for the PI to attend the AIChE Annual Meeting and travel to NSF for discussions leading to the preparation of the presentation before the meeting and evaluation after the meeting. Since this is the first time the  Proposal Writing Tutorial  is included in the workshop, extra effort is required to prepare the tutorial, so that it can be used as a template for the future presentations. The proposed topic of the tutorial is  Strategies for Successful Grant Writing,  which tentatively will be composed of three main parts: (1) Learning more about funding agencies, program officers, competitors, and the process, (2) Making a proposal competitive, and (3) The benefit of employing interdisciplinary and transformative research. This travel funding will also allow the PI to be available with Dr. John Regalbuto for individual Workshop appointments with faculty at the NSF Hospitality Suit during the meeting.\n",

      "The broad objective of this grant proposal is to study the mechanisms responsible for the fidelity of DMAsynthesis. DMA polymerases are the key enzymes involved in replication and repair of DMA. An analysis ofhow polymerases control fidelity is central to understanding the biochemical basis of a wide variety of geneticdiseases. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and ADA deficiency are two examples of inherited childhood diseases thatcan arise from a single point mutation. Activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genesleading to cancer can result from single base changes in DNA. Genetic defects in post-replication mismatchrepair of DNA polymerase errors are a root cause of hereditary nonpolyposis colin cancer, along with a varietyof other types of cancer. Previous fidelity studies have focused on individual DNA polymerases in the absenceof polymerase accessory proteins required to sustain processive synthesis. This grant investigates the fidelityof purified procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA polymerase holoenzymes, pol III and pol IIfrom Escherichia coli, andpol delta from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A thorough understanding of fidelity mechanisms of DNApolymerases requires an analysis of the effects of sequence context and replication assessory proteins onfidelity. The proposed experiments, which include a full complement of polymerase subunits, are among thefirst of its kind, and make use of a mathematical model of polymerase fidelity and a gel fidelity assay that we'vedeveloped previously. The model is used to predict the effect of polymerase processivity subunits on basesubstitution fidelity. These predictions will be tested experimentally. Steady state kinetic experiments aredesigned to investigate the biochemical basis of mutational  hot  and  cold  spots. We propose to test theimportance of hydrogen bonds between Watson-Crick base pairs on polymerase fidelity, by measuring theeffects of base stacking on polymerase fidelity, in the absence of hydrogen bonding. Presteady state kineticexperiments, using fluorescent nucleotide analogs, are proposed to measure switching between polymeraseand exonuclease active sites in  real-time . A second set of presteady state experiments are designed todetermine the mechanism for loading and unloading the polymerase processivity clamp subunit onto DNA and toanalyze the requirements for ATP hydrolysis for each step in the clamp-loading pathway. This pathway isrequired for Okazaki fragment formation during discontinuous lagging-strand DNA synthesis.PERFORMANCE SIT t(S) (organization, city, state)University of Southern CaliforniaDepartment of Biological SciencesUniversity ParkLos Angeles, CA 90089-1340KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) includes a constellation of symptoms and deficits in social behavior has become acknowledged as possibly one of the most debilitating symptoms. However,the behavioral and neural mechanism giving rise to the social deficits seen in FASD and the degreeto which the environment plays a role in these social deficits remains unknown. Thus, theenvironment of alcohol-exposed pups will be modified such that they are exposed to intensive norma social interactions during development, isolation during the juvenile period, and abnormal mothering behavior in order to examine mitigating or exacerbating factors in the social deficits. Interactions of environment will be examined across different doses of alcohol, with the prediction that effects of low doses of alcohol will be more sensitive to environmental manipulations. Based on evidence from this laboratory and others, it is hypothesized that the ethanol-induced social deficits might arise from changes in mu opioid system. This hypothesis is examined using autoradiography and microinjectior techniques. Behavioral analyses of the social deficits observed in animals exposed to alcohol during development has demonstrated that the deficits are not likely due to changes in social motivationanc some evidence suggests that there are deficits in the ability to process social cues. The social response of animals to different gradations of sensory cues and the ability to detect social cues inthe olfactory, auditory and somatosensory domains will be examined. Using the additive factors method, the contribution of deficits in social cue processing to social deficits in general in ethanol-exposed animals will be determined. c-Fos immunoreactivity will be used to examine the neural structures contributing to the sensory processing deficit. The rat model of FASD used in this proposal entails exposure during both the prenatal and postnatal period, mimicking the effect of alcohol exposure during all three trimesters in the humans.FASD continues to be a public health problem occurring large expenses both to society and theindividual. The proposed studies will use a rat model of FASD to delineate the behavioral andneurobiological mechanism underlying the social deficits in this disorder and the contribution ofsocial environments to the impact of ethanol during development. These findings can then betranslated into both biological and behavioral treatments for FASD.

      "The vertebrate inner ear is a sensory organ implicated in hearing, balance and detection of acceleration. Itdevelops from a thickening of the embryonic ectoderm known as the otic placode. Defining the molecular processes leading to specification of the otic placode is essential to understand inner ear development. Sox proteins comprise a large class of transcriptional regulators. One member of this family, Sox9, a well- established regulator of chondrogenesis and sex determination, is also one of the earliest genes expressed in the presumptive otic placode. Mutations in Sox9 result in campomelic dysplasia (CD), a fatal human disordercharacterized by severe skeletal malformations and XY sex reversal. Reports of rare CD patients that survived indicate that they are also affected with sensorineural deafness, suggesting that Sox9 may play an important role in the development of the auditory system. We have shown that the otic expression of Sox9 in Xenopus is initiated early in the sensory layer of the ectoderm. In this tissue, Sox9 expression is regulated by Fgf and Wnt signaling and co-localizes with Pax8, one of the earliest gene expressed in response to otic placode inducing signals. Depletion of Sox9 protein inwhole embryos using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides causes a dramatic loss of early and late oticmarkers, and in the most extreme cases these embryos fail to form a morphologically recognizable oticvesicle. The experiments below will test the following hypothesis: the transcription factor Sox9 is a key component of regulatory pathway required for inner ear specification. We propose: 1-To define the molecular regulators of Sox9 expression in the otic placode by establishing theorigin of the signals activating Sox9 expression in the otic placode; and defining the requirement and sufficiency of Fgf and Wnt signaling for otic placode specification in whole embryos and animal explants.2-To characterize the ear phenotype of Xenpopus Sox9-deficient embryos 3-To identify Sox9-interactingpartner molecules in the otic placode using a yeast two-hybrid screen, since Sox proteins are known to regulate their target genes through interaction with cell type-specific partner molecules.The characterization of such partner molecules should further our understanding of Sox9-mediated gene regulation in the context of the developing inner ear.3ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PAKEY PERSONNEL.

      "bxins, pathogenic infection (viral and bacterial), and physical injury to the liver results in a loss of hepatic tis- ue, triggering a regenerative response to restore liver cell mass. Dysregulation in the repair process can lead o liver failure or liver cancer. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor Imctionally identified with proliferative processes. TheAhR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) he prototype for a class of compounds responsible for a range of toxic or adaptive endpoints, inhibits liver re-generation following tissue injury thus implicating the AhR in liver repair. Our long-term goal is to understand Tiechanistically how the AhR contributes to liver homeostasis by regulating cell proliferation, and thereby identify he molecular basis for TCDD-induced disruption of normal biological processes. We hypothesize that the AhRplays an important role in liver homeostasis, in part by regulating progress through G1phase of the cell cyclel/n proliferating hepatocytes. The goal of this proposal is to examine the functional relationship between AhRactivity and TCDD responsiveness proteins known to regulate hepatocyte proliferation. Specifically, the plannedstudies will examine the molecular basis and relative contribution of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibi- ion and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression on liver regeneration. TCDD alters CDK2 activityand PAI-1 expression during liver regeneration, representing distinct intracellular and extracellular (autocrine orparacrine) mechanisms of action that conspire to inhibit the restorative response to injury. Preliminary evidencealso demonstrates that AhR regulation of the PAI-1 gene involves a novel (non-XRE) DNA element that will becharacterized in detail. The proposed studies are an extension of currently funded research looking at the AhR n regulating hepatic proliferation in cell culture models, and seeks to build on previous findings using a physi-ologically relevant (non-transformed) model of cell proliferation. Parallels between humans and mice in the re-generative response, instills confidence that findings generated during these studies will be directly applicable ;o the human condition.ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, TX.PHS398 (Rev09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): ELFERINK, Cornelis JohanKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Burn injury initiates a series of pathophysiological changes. A progressive fall in left ventricular (LV)contractile function despite aggressive fluid resuscitation has been reported in both clinical and experimentalstudies of burn injury. However, the source(s) or the signaling pathways involved in burn-induced myocardialdysfunction remain largely unknown. Recent studies from our group indicated that gut-derived myocardialdepressant factors carried in intestinal lymph trigger myocardial contractile depression. In addition, ourpreliminary studies demonstrated that the physiologically relevant concentrations of mesenteric lymphcollected from rats receiving 40 % burn injury (burn lymph), but not lymph from sham-burned rats (controllymph), to ventricular myocytes isolated from healthy rats leads to a significant alterations in action potentialduration associated with disturbed Ca2+homeostasis. In other preliminary work, we have found that burnlymph increases myocyte size, mitogen-activated protein kinases and cell death of cultured neonatal ratventricular myocytes after 24 hrs incubation, suggesting a common mechanistic link between burn traumaand hypertrophic heart disease. In this proposal, we will capitalize on these discoveries and propose tofurther investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in burn-induced myocardial dysfunctionand the roles of burn lymph in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To begin understanding thecellular basis for altered myocardial function, this proposal focuses on cellular mechanisms important formyocardial Ca2+ homeostasis. Wehypothesize that 1)burn injury-inducedLV dysfunction issecondaryto gut-derived factor(s) contained in mesenteric lymph (burn lymph), and 2)changes in ioniccurrents and Ca2 -cyclingproteins caused by burn lymph areinvolvedin burn-inducedLVdysfunction and ultimately to heart failure (HF). To test the hypothesis, this grant proposal also includesgenomics and protein chemistry to elucidate valuable information in the heart after burn injury. This researchis fundamental to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of burn-related myocardial dysfunction. Abetter understanding of molecular etiology and downstream mechanisms could lead to improved therapeuticmeasures to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with burn injury.UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Yatani, AtSUko, Ph.D.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Acute lung injury has a poor prognosis and a diverse etiology. Numerous precipitating factors have beenidentified, yet questions remain about the pathophysiological mechanisms controlling this complexcondition and their relationship to therapeutic strategies. Marked by epithelial damage and loss of surfactantfunction, acute lung injury can lead to growth factor activation, including activation of transforming growthfactor-a (TGFa) and TGFp. These growth factors, in turn, control proliferation and the transcription ofgenes involved in differentiated function. Previously, a genetic locus that harbors TGFa was linked to, andTGFa transgenic mice were rescued from, acute lung injury. Additional data imply that these effects maybe mediated through EGFR located on respiratory epithelial cells. Conditional TGFa transgenic mice havebeen generate to permit detailed investigations of the temporal role of this growth factor in lung injury.Recently, we found TGFp is released, and many TGFp responsive transcripts are altered in our model ofacute lung injury. Our central hypothesis is that the interplay between TGFa and TGFp signaling pathwaysdetermines survival and the sequelae resulting from acute lung injury by altering transcriptional programscritical to lung function. To further assess the role of TGFa and TGFp in acute lung injury, we propose tomanipulate TGFa signaling and monitor the consequences on TGFp signaling. The Specific Aims of thisproposal seek to: 1) Identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for TGFa/EGFR mediated protection inacute lung injury, 2) Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of TGFa induction and TGFa/EGFR signaling duringacute lung injury and determine whether pulmonary fibrosis is a necessary sequela as a consequence ofprotection, and 3) Determine the genetic mechanisms of TGFa and TGFp interactions that modulate criticalgene expression, focusing on the cis-acting elements that control Sftpb promoter transactivation. Thisresearch is innovative because it will directly evaluate the potential therapeutic benefits of TGFa/EGFRsignaling and the possible interactions of TGFa with TGFp in acute lung injury. At the completion of thisproject, we expect to: 1) Identify the transcriptional events modulated by TGFa that leads to protection fromacute lung injury, 2) Gain a better understanding of how TGFp functions in acute lung injury, and 3)Determine whether pulmonary fibrosis is an untoward consequence of activating TGFa/EGFR signalingduring acute lung injury. The anticipated impact of these studies would be an evidence-based scientificverification or refutation of the likelihood that therapeutics directed at TGFa/EGFR signaling could beconsidered for the treatment of acute lung injury.PERFORMAMCE SITE(S,) (organization, city, state)University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OhioKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The long-term goal of this project is to discover novel types of broad-spectrum antibioticscapable of effectively eradicating a wide range of potential biowarfare agents, as well asconventional pathogens. In this phase of the project, we will develop a high-throughput screen for atargeted discovery of prodrug antibiotics. The screen is aimed at solving the following problems thathave impeded antimicrobial drug discovery: automatically eliminate a high background of generally-toxic molecules in compound library screening; obtain lead compounds with good penetration intoGram negative species, indicative of a broad spectrum of activity; and an ability to sterilize aninfection by eliminating persister cells invulnerable to all current antibiotics. Prodrugs such as metronidazole convert inside the cell into a reactive molecule that hits multipletargets. In this regard, an activated prodrug acts like an antiseptic. Our preliminary data show thatprodrugs can potentially completely sterilize a stationary state population of E.co//containingpersisters. An ability to sterilize an infection can be critically important for treatingimmunocompromised individuals and multidrug tolerant biofilms that cause 65% of all infectiousdiseases in developed countries. An activated prodrug will bind covalently to its targets, creating anirreversible sink which will allow it to avoid efflux by MDR pumps of Gram negative species which isthe main obstacle in developing broad-spectrum antibiotics. We will use E.'coli,.including the O157:H7 enterohemorrhagic strain that is a Category Bwaterborne agent in screen development. The process will include test strainconstruction-screening at the National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence inBiodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases facility in Boston and at an NIH Screening Center,and validation of hits to indicate their prodrug nature. This research will lead to the development of new antibiotics with a broad spectrum of actionthat will be effective against both bioweapons agents such as Y.pestis, F. tularensis and B.anthracis, and conventional pathogens. The uniquely novel property of these compounds will betheir ability to completely sterilize an infection, preventing relapse of a disease and enablingeffective treatment of immunodeficient individuals, including the elderly and the very young.PERFORMANCE,SITE(S) (organization, city, state) ,Northeastern Mniversity, Boston, MANational Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and EmergingInfectious Diseases, Boston, MAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Lewis, KimKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The objective of this proposal is to investigate the roles of membrane factors in amyloid-p peptide (A(3)-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in glial cells. Here membrane factors include localmembrane phase properties and cytoskeletal linkage of membrane receptors. Ap-induced oxidative stressand inflammation are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, Ap has been found to induce oxidativestress through activation of NADPH oxidase. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, in turn, causeoxidative damage including lipid peroxidation, oxidation of RNA, DMA, and proteins, which subsequentlyperturb normal cellular processes, including intracellular signaling and cytoskeleton organization. In thisregard, we have previously reported that oxidative stress causes astrocyte membrane to become more gel-like through activations of p38 MARK and of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Our preliminary resultsalso show Ap42 oligomers induce activation of cPLA2. Since it has been reported that the efficiency ofNADPH oxidase activation is dependent of its local membrane environment and our preliminary studiesshow that the membrane subunit of NADPH oxidase, gp91ph0*, is predominately localized at the high GPdomains (i.e. more gel-like membranes) in astrocytes, these findings lead us to hypothesize that Af!*?induces cPLA? activation through activations of NADPH oxidase and MAPK pathways to cause glialmembranes to become more gel-like, which, in turn, becomes a positive feedback to further amplify theactivation of NADPH oxidase to produce ROS. Other membrane factors, such as cytoskeletal linkages of membrane receptors, can also be afundamental element governing cell functions. It has been reported that Ap42 binds to membrane receptors,CD36, ctePi, CD47 and scavenger receptor class A, resulting in inflammatory responses in microglial cells,which can be suppressed by blocking the binding of Ap42 to one of these receptors using their antibodies.These findings lead us to hypothesize that cooperativitv between these membrane receptors is required forAB-induced inflammatory responses in microglial cells and this coooerativitv is established through thecvtoskeletal linkages of these membrane receptors. Since oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in AD, our study on how membrane factorsinvolved in the mechanisms of Ap-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in glial cells willprove critical to deepen our understandings in the pathogenesis of AD. Novel biophysical techniquesincluding fluorescence imaged deformation (FIMD) and fluorescent microscopy of LAURDAN, and variousbiochemical techniques will be applied to accomplish this proposed project.University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MOPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Lee, James, Chak-ManKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a process whereby individual cells are terminated to benefitthe organism. However, many cancers inhibit apoptotic pathways to allow cell proliferation, whiledegenerative diseases may up-regulate apoptosis to kill cells prematurely. In the intrinsic cell deathpathway, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria and interacts with Apaf-1 in the presence dATP.This triggers apoptosome assembly and the resulting platform recruits and activates procaspase-9. Thisholo-enzyrne then activates executioner procaspases which kill the cell. Significantly, Apaf-1 assemblyhas recently been implicated as a possible contributing factor to major depression syndrome (MDD). InDrosophila, a similar cell killing machine is formed by Dark, an Apaf-1 Related Killer which sequentiallyactivates the procaspases Drone andDrICE. In Specific Aims 1and 2,we will determine high resolution, 3-dimensional structures of the Apaf-1and Dark apoptosomes. In addition, structures will be obtained of  holo-enzymes  with prodomainsfrom their apical procaspases. In these studies, electron cryo-microscopyand single particle methods, X-ray crystallography and homology modeling will be used to create atomic models. These studies willprovide a detailed picture of human and Drosophila apoptosomes and will also reveal conformationalchanges that occur when procaspases bind. Thus, Specific Aims 1 and 2 will and give a clearerunderstanding of how these large platformsassemble and function in the intrinsic cell deathpathway. In pro-inflammatory pathways, the Apaf-1 related protein NOD2 senses bacteria and assembles asignaling platform. Througha series of steps, this complexactivates the transcription factor NFK0, whichup-regulates genes involved in innate or adaptive immunity. Defects in NOD2 are associated withchronic inflammation of the small intestine (Crohn's disease) and with Blau's syndrome. In Specific Aim3, a NOD2signaling platformwill be assembled and the first 3-dimensional structure of this complex willbe determined. In the long term, these studies will help us to understand how NOD2 functions in theinnate immune response to bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tractBoston University School of Medicine (BUSM)Boston, Mass.PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/ProgramDirector (Last, First, Middle): Akey, Christopher W.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Mammalian neurosecretory neurons are excellent models for understandingthe relationship between spikedischarge patterns and hormone/transmitter release in the central nervous system. Neurosecretory neuronsadopt a bursting pattern that promotes maximally efficient stimulus-secretion coupling at the nerve terminal.The phasic bursting activity in vasopressin neurons is exemplary of this pattern, and relatively unique in ihatit can be studied in vitro, as it results largely from intrinsic membrane properties. The global hypothesis of thisproposal is that phasic burstingper se can be explained largely by the understanding of one primary current,its modulation by Ca++, and its autoregulation by dynorphin through Kopiate receptors.The Specific Aims are: Aim 1) Determine the ion species, underlyingconductance change, and Ca++-dependence of the currentunderlying the DAP (IDAP)- Experimentally, we will test several predictions from a powerful computationalmodel simulating phasic activity developed during the past grant period. We predict that the plateau potentialunderlying bursts results from a Ca++ dependent inhibition of a K+ leak current, such that this current attainsvoltage-dependence in elevated [Ca++].. Aim 2) Determine the mechanism of the autoregulatory inhibition of VP neurons via Kopiate receptors.We predict that dynorphin, released locally during a burst from vasopressin neurons, shifts the Ca++ sensitivityof a K+ leak current rightward, raising its threshold, and terminating the burst. Aim 3) Determine the role of autoregulation in the variability of phasic bursting expression in vitro.We predict that phasic bursting is correlated with the ability of dynorphin to regulate the DAP and burst lengthand complimentarily, that deficits in phasic bursting activity are due to deficits in autoregulation. A corollaryis that phasic bursting may be related to the degree of dendritic arbor present. Understanding the origin of phasic bursting is critical to understanding how VP release is controlled inboth physiological and pathophysiological conditions. VP release is critical to normal water balance andcardiovascular regulation.PERFORMANCE.

      "The goals of this project are to develop a DNA vaccine formulationthat effectivelystimulates all arms of theimmune response mechanismand is applicableto a human HIV-1 DNA vaccine. The novel focus of thisresearch is to target the antigen as a chimera containing sequences of the lysosome membrane protein(LAMP) that traffick the chimera to the major histocompatability class II (MHC II) compartment for antigenprocessing and presention. This approach is designed to increase antigen-specific CD4+ T-helper (Th)lymphocyte responses which are critical for optimal CD8+and humoral immune responses. Our researchwith the LAMP/Gag chimera vaccine has shown that targeting of the antigen to the MHC II compartmentresults in a marked increase in all arms of the immune responses of mice, antibody, CD4+helper T cells, andCD8+cytotoxic T cells, with increases in CD4 antibody responses 10- to 100-fold greater than thoseresulting from DNA encoding wild type antigen. Our proposed research has the following specific aims: (1)Analysis of primate immune responses to LAMP-targeted HIV-I Gag is being conducted under the auspicesof the NIAID to determine if the enhanced immune responses of mice to DNA encoding an HIV-1 LAMP/Gagchimera is applicable to a non-human primate. We will synthesize the human LAMP/Gag chimera, validatethe correct expression and trafficking of the antigen, and assay relevant immune responses of theimmunized monkeys. The synthesis and analysis of MHC II targeting of DNA vaccines encoding Env, Rev,Tat, and Nef as other candidates for possible human clinical studies will also be initiated. (2) Dendritic cellspecific proteins, DC-LAMP and C-type lectin endocytic receptors, that also traffick to the MHC IIcompartment and demonstrate properties as Gag chimeras that differ from the multicellular LAMP targetingsystem, are being analyzed for possibly unique immune response mechanisms that may prove of value to aHIV-1 DNA vaccine formulation. (3) Evaluation of adeno-associated virus vector (AAV), one of the mostpromising gene delivery vehicles, is being conducted with our DNA vaccine formulations. Initial promisingresults of prolonged immunogenicity and enhanced antibody response to a DNA prime, AAV boost regimen,encourage continued investigation.PERFORMANCESITE(S) (organization,city, state)The Johns Hopkins UniversitySchoolof Medicine,Baltimore,MarylandJohns HopkinsSingaporeBiomedicalCentre, SingaporeKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The acidic amino acid, glutamate, is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in themammalian central nervous system. Although there are millimolar concentrations of this excitatoryamino acid (EAA) in the brain, extracellular concentrations are maintained in the low micromolarrange to facilitate crisp synaptic transmission and to prevent excessive activation of receptors thatcan kill neurons (or other cells that express glutamate receptors). A family of Na^-dependent high-affinity glutamate transporters is responsible for the regulation and clearance of extracellular EAAs.This project represents a collaborative effort between two laboratories that have contributed to ourunderstanding of the biochemical, pharmacologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic properties ofthese transporters. In this competitive renewal, we propose to continue focusing on one of the astroglial glutamatetransporters, called GLT-1 or EAAT2. There is substantial evidence to suggest that this transportermediates the largest percentage of glutamate uptake activity in the forebrain. The expression(mRNA and protein) of GLT-1/EAAT2 increases during synaptogenesis in vivo and is induced inastrocytes in vitro by the presence of neurons. Lesions of projection neurons in vivo results indecreased GLT-1/EAAT2 expression in target areas. In addition, several acute and chronicneurodegenerative diseases (or animal models of these diseases) are accompanied by decreasedexpression of GLT-1/EAAT2. Based on our prior studies and our preliminary data, we propose toidentify signals/transcription factors and promoter elements that contribute to basal and 'neuron-dependent' induction of GLT-1/EAAT2 (Aims I & II). In pur preliminary studies, we have alsoidentified fragments of the GLT-1/EAAT2 5' non-coding region that contain elements that suppresstranscription. These elements will also be characterized (Aims I & II). As we identify elements thatare required for induction/suppression of GLT-1 expression, these elements will be introduced intomodels of neurologic insults with the goal of determining if the presence damaged/dying neuronsresults in decreased promoter activation or results in active suppression of GLT-1 transcription. With this approach, we hope to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate theexpression of the predominant protein that limits excitability in the normal nervous system and todevelop an understanding of the factors that may contribute to the loss of this protein in both acuteand chronic neurodegenerative diseases.Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaThe Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MarylandPHS 398 (Rev.09/04) Page 2 Form Page2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Robinson, Michael B.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Long term goals of this project are to determine the biotin requirements for normal individuals and forindividuals in circumstances in which biotin status may be impaired and to investigate the consequences andpathogenic mechanisms of marginal biotin deficiency.We recently demonstrated that marginal biotin deficiency iscommon during normal human gestation and have demonstrated that marginal deficiency is quite teratogenic inmice. Thus, the following five specific aims are relevant and timely. In Specific Aim #1, we will test the hypothesis that maternal biotin deficiency causes abnormal development offetal skeleton and palate by causing deficient fetal activity of the biotin-dependent enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylasewhich leads in turn to deficiency of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin. In fetal palate and limb bud explants frombiotin deficient and sufficient CD-I mice, we will quantitate fetal arachidonic acid content and synthesis rates andwill examine the malformation ameliorating effects of supplementation of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin andthe amelioration blocking effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Analogous studies will also be conducted in vivo;In Specific Aim #2, we will test the hypothesis that infants with cleft palate or limb shortening have significantlyreduced biotin status compared to normal infants. In a case-controlled study, biotin status will be assessed in cordblood using odd-chain fatty acid composition in red blood cell membranes and plasma and lymphocyte activity ofthe biotin-dependent enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase. In Specific Aim #3, we will clone and sequence a biotintransporter recently discovered in our laboratory. In studies of cells from the first individual with biotin transporterdeficiency, we will investigate the molecular nature of the genetic defect. In Specific Aim #4, we will confirmpromising new indicators of biotin status and investigate the validity of the expression of particular biotin-relatedgenes (e.g., carboxylases) as indicators of marginal biotin deficiency in healthy adults rendered marginallybiotindeficiency by egg-white feeding. In Specific Aim #5, we will determine the subcellular localization of theenzyme(s) responsible for catalyzing the p-oxidation of biotin to the inactive metabolite bisnorbiotin andcharacterize this pathway. Understanding of this pathway is important because accelerated biotin catabolism maybe the major cause of biotin deficiency in pregnancy and anticonvulsants.PERFORMANCE snt(S) (organization, city, state)University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, ARGeneral Clinical Research Center, McClellan Veteran's Hospital, Little Rock, ARKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Cancer progression depends on the action of proteolytic systems that facilitate the growth and invasion oftumor cells. The membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) endows tumor cells with the abilityto invade and grow within collagenous matrices and thus is a key protease in cancer progression. As amembrane-tethered protease, MT1-MMP is regulated by a dynamic interplay of regulatory mechanisms thatcollectively control the level of active enzyme on the tumor cell surface and in the pericellular space. The long term objective of this application is to unveil the mechanisms regulating MT1-MMP activity at the tumorcell surface and apply this knowledge towards the development of new approaches aimed at inhibitingMT1-MMP in cancer. Our previous effort has been focused on elucidating the structural features and biochemical processesthat define the ability of MT1-MMP to undergo autocatalytic processing and ectodomain shedding on the cellmembrane, two fundamental processes of enzyme regulation. Processing of active MT1-MMP yields aninactive membrane-tethered fragment of 44 kDa that maintains key enzyme domains but its function inMT1-MMP regulation is poorly understood. Ectodomain shedding of MT1-MMP yields a 50-kDa solubleform that is present in tumors and is a fully competent protease. However its contribution to tumorproteolysis is unknown. Herein, new evidence in vitro and in tumor xenografts shows that the membrane-tethered 44-kDa species, displays a dynamic interaction with active MT1-MMP and identifies thisfragment as a complex regulator of enzyme function in tumor cells. The naturally shed ectodomain ofMT1-MMP has been characterized and found to be a catalytically competent protease, sensitive to TIMP-2,which has the potential to expand the proteolytic repertoire of MT1-MMP from the confines of the cell membrane to the pericellular space and regulate the activity of membrane-anchored MT1-MMP. Collectively, these observations pose a new paradigm in the regulation of MT1-MMP activity and suggestthe hypothesis that processed and soluble forms of MT1-MMP play critical roles in tumor malignancy. Totest this hypothesis we propose to: (1) investigate the dynamic interplay between the processed and activeforms of MT1-MMP in enzyme function, (2) define the structural basis for the effects of the 44-kDa specieson MT1-MMP regulation, (3) investigate the role of the soluble MT1-MMP in the regulation of MT1-MMPactivity and (4) investigate the role of processed and soluble forms of MT1-MMP in functional assays oftumor cell invasion and growth in vitro and in vivo. The results of this application will contribute to our understanding of MT1-MMP function in tumor cells and contribute to the collective effort aimed at inhibiting its activity in cancerous tissues.

      "Ethanol inhibits cell adhesion mediated by the L1 cell adhesion molecule in neural cells and in fibroblasts ransfected with human L1. Because the brains of children with L1 mutations resemble those of children with tal alcohol syndrome, it is possible that inhibition of L1-mediated cell adhesion contributes to the eratogenic effects of ETOH. Structure activity analysis of a series of straight and branch-chain alcoholsdemonstrates remarkable structural specificity for alcohol inhibition of cell-cell adhesion. Moreover, we have dentified a series of compounds that antagonize the effects of ethanol on L1-mediated cell-cell adhesion, on BMP morphogenesis in cultured neural cells, and on the development of mouse whole embryo cultures. The underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that compounds that antagonize ethanol inhibition of L1-mediated cell-cell adhesion will also prevent ethanol teratogenesis. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1. To identify the structural determinants of alcohols and related compounds that are required for inhibition of cell-cell adhesion in L1-expressing cells and for antagonism of this inhibition; 2. To determine the mechanism(s) by which ethanol inhibits L1 adhesion and induces apoptotic cell death in neurons; 3. To characterize regions of L1 that are necessary for alcohol inhibition and for antagonism of ethanol inhibition; 4. To evaluate selected ethanol antagonists for their ability to prevent the teratogenic effects of ethanol in mouse whole embryo culture and during early embryogenesis in C57BI/J6 mice. Techniques employed in these studies will include mammalian cell transfection, cell-aggregation assays, mutagenesis of the L1 molecule, mousewhole embryo culture, and macroscopic and microscopic analysis of mice exposed to ethanol in utero. These experiments may lead to a better understanding of how ethanol interacts with neura proteins and may reveal mechanisms whereby ethanol causes birth defects. A major goal of the proposed research is to identify compounds that reduce the teratogenic effects of ethanol.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Harvard Medical School,VA Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MACenter for Alcohol Studies, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NCKEY PERSONNEL.

      "PROVIDED. In a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant oophorectomy and tamoxifen in 709 premenopausalVietnamese and Chinese women with breast cancer, the proposers have demonstrated overall benefit(increased 5-year disease-free and overall survival) and specific benefit only to hormonereceptor-positive tumor-bearing patients. Morbidity and symptomatic toxicity of this therapy were low; acost-effectiveness analysis, assuming costs in Vietnam, shows a cost per life-year gained of $351. Indetailed secondary analyses, benefit from adjuvant therapy was significantly greater in womenundergoing simultaneous mastectomy and oophorectomy in the history-estimated luteal phases of theirmenstrual cycles. Analyses of axillary node-positive and younger (<= 44) patient subsets further supporta novel hypothesis that adjuvant luteal phase surgical oophorectomy is more effective than this surgeryperformed in the follicular phase. The investigators propose a new randomized, controlled trial to investigate this hypothesis in 510Vietnamese and Filipino premenopausal women, <= 44 years old with regular menstrual cycles andhormone receptor-positive tumors, undergoing adjuvant surgical oophorectomy followed by tamoxifentherapy. Participants will be stratified according to their likelihood of being in luteal phase of themenstrual cycle for the entire following 1-6 days, and those so unlikely will be randomized to scheduledmid-luteal phase oophorectomy or immediate oophorectomy. Blood samples for later hormonal assayswill be taken on the day of oophorectomy. With accrual over 2 to 3 years and follow-up of 3 additionalyears, the study has 0.78-0.86 power to demonstrate disease-free survival differences which aretwo-thirds of those observed in the original study. The US investigators are experienced in conducting clinical trials and have proven track records forcompleting and publishing useful data from their work. The collaborating institutions and investigatorsare also clinical trial-experienced and have the patients and systems to ensure compliance with theprotocol, complete pathology specimen collection and follow-up.

      "The long term goal of this project is to understand, on a fundamental level, how the Tetrahymena ribozyme achieves its enormous rate enhancement and how this intron carries out the complex series of steps required for the accurate and efficient ligation of exons. It is hoped that such in-depth understanding will furthermore general understanding of both biological catalysis and RNA. In addition, ribozymes are under investigations as potential therapeutics for the targeted destruction of specific RNAs in vivo, and it is possible that fundamental insights provided by this work will aid in the design of such therapeutic RNAs. Specific aims for the next five years are as follows: 1. The kinetic and thermodynamic description of Tetrahymena ribozyme reactions will be further developed to probe specific mechanistic questions of RNA catalysis and to address how this intron functions to carry out the multi-step self-splicing reaction. Such detailed analysis of individual reaction steps is crucial for dissecting catalytic strategies and for understanding function in a complex molecular process such as self-splicing. This self-splicing reaction may provide a model for the involvement of RNA in more complex processes such as pre- mRNA splicing and translation. 2. Divalent metal ions are crucial to RNA folding and function, but the role of individual metal is typically obscured by the 'sea' of metal ions that coat the charged phosphodiester backbone of RNA. Recent studies have identified a novel set of metal ion/ substrate interactions involving three active site metal ions. The identity of functional groups on the ribozyme that coordinate these active site metal ion will now be probed, as will metal ion/ substrate interactions in individualreaction steps.3. Transition state analogs have been valuable in understanding interactions of protein enzymes that are responsible for transition state stabilization. Analogs that mimic aspects of the transition state for the ribozyme reaction may help in understanding the energetics of catalysis; in determining the ability of RNA to provide catalysis via intramolecularity; and in providing a stable model of transition state interactions that will allow structural characterization of the active conformation of the ribozyme. The binding properties of bisubstrate analogs, synthesized with 3',3'-phosphodiester linkages, and vanadyl transition state analogs for the ribozyme will be determined.3ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Stanford UniversityStanford, CAKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This competing renewal application will extend the applicant's studies on the relationship of the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) to Alzheimer's disease (AD).LRP, a large multifunctional receptor with multiple ligand binding domains, is the major neuronal receptor forapolipoprotein E (apoE), alpha-2 macroglobulin (a2M), and the KPI containing forms of the amyloid precursorprotein (APP), all implicated in the pathophysiology of AD by both biochemical and genetic evidence. Ouroverarching hypothesis is that A6 deposition is central to AD, and that LRP is in a critical position to influencethe balance of ABgeneration and clearance. Both apoE and a2M form stable complexes with AB. Aim 1 teststhe hypothesis that apoE/AB and a2M/AB complexes are cleared, and that this clearance is via LRP. We willdetermine the specific domains on LRP which mediate these processes. Aim 2 explores our recent observationthat LRP binds and internalizes full length APP, and that blockingthis endocytic process decreases AB generationand secretion. The discovery that the LRP intracellulardomain binds the adapter protein Fe65, a protein which isknown to form a complex with the intracellular domain of APP, also implicates APP-LRP complex formation asbeing important in APP trafficking and potentially AB generation. We have also found that LRP undergoesPKC-mediated serine phosphorylation, and will test the hypotheses that this affects LRP trafficking, or LRPinteractions with Fe65 or APP. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis,based on new preliminary data, that LRP may servea role both as an endocytic receptor and as a novel type of signalingreceptor in neurons. We have observed thatactivated a2M induces a RAP blockable, calcium response in neurons (but not nonneuronal cells), and willcharacterize this calcium response. Ligand competent A2M also induces an increase in LRP amount and cellsurface LRP; our working hypothesis is that the amount of cell surface LRP is regulated in part by this calciumresponse. The proposed studies will continue a highly productive and long standing collaboration amonginvestigators at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the American Red Cross in order to pursue new excitingleads which impact our understandingof pathophysiologicmechanismsin AD, and which will lead toadditionalinsight in the neurobiology of LRP.PERFORMANCE SIIE:(S) (organization, city, state)Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MAAmerican Red Cross, Rockville,MDKEY PEIRSONNEL.

      "Cervical carcinoma, the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide, is associated with human papilloma virus (HPV). Although HPV infection is widespread in the teenaged population, most cases of cervical carcinoma occur 20-30 years after initial exposure. Therefore, it is likely that HPV provides an initiation step or  first hit  in cervical carcinoma development. HPV-infected individualsare at high risk for developing cervical carcinoma; however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the progression of cervical cancer have not been established. This proposal will identify a potential subsequent hit that leads to cervical carcinoma. We have detected increased cytoplasmic and nuclear 6-catenin levels in cervical carcinoma patient samples, yet mutations in the 6-catenin gene are rare in these tumors. Because 6-catenin accumulation is an indicator of activated Wnt pathway, we will study the Wnt signaling as a tumor promoting pathway. Our experimental model of cervical carcinoma uses HPV-immortalized primary human keratinocytes. In an in vitro experimental model, malignant transformation of HPV-immortalized keratinocytes can be achieved by transfecting them with SV-40 small-t antigen (smt). Our published preliminary data indicate thatmalignant transformation of HPV-infected primary human keratinocytes by smt involves activation of the Wnt pathway. We present preliminary data that Wnt pathway activation by Wnts and their down stream signaling components also transform HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. However, activation of the Wnt pathway in the absence of HPV infection is not sufficient to induce malignant transformation. Therefore, we hypothesize that Wnt signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer and causes progression to achieve malignant transformation. The following specific aims will be used to test our hypothesis; Specific Aim 1 will determine the in vivo effect of 6-catenin stabilizationin HPV-infected cervical epithelium using transgenic mouse models. Specific Aim 2 will determine the mechanism of Wnt pathway activation in human tumor specimens of cervical cancer. Results of specific aim 1 will provide us with a clinically relevant mouse cervical carcinoma model for chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Results of specific aim 2 will lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathobiology of cervical cancer. This knowledge will allow us to identify woman at high-risk,who are more likely to progress to malignantcervical carcinoma. Results of this study can validate molecular targets in cervical carcinoma, which can be used for designing novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.Georgetown University, Washington, DCPHS 398(Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):KEY PERSONNEL.

We willalso examine changes in afferent neurons induced by chronic pathological conditions that result in bladderirritation and hyperactivity. Several hypotheses will be tested: (1) Several subtypes of nociceptors are present in thebladder wall and these subtypes exhibit distinct electrophysiologic properties arid-distinct receptive/signalingmechanisms, (2) Acute sensitization of bladder nociceptors involves a change in several membrane ionchannels including: tetrodotoxin-resistant Na+ channels, yanilloid receptors (VRl) which are sensitive tocapsaicin, ATP-sensitive purinergic receptors, fast activation R+ channels and acid sensitive cation channels(ASIC), (3) Chronic pathological conditions of the lower urinary tract alter the expression of ion channels orneurotransmitter mechanisms in afferent neurons. This effect may be mediated by neurotrophic factorsreleased within the bladder, (4) Bidirectional chemical communication between the urothelium and adjacentnerves plays a role in sensory mechanisms as well as in epithelial cell function in the urinary tract.

      "Thrombin generated by the prothrombinase complex contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of commonclinical disorders such as myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.The prothrombinase complex consists of the enzyme factor Xa, the cofactor factor Va and a phospholipidmembrane surface. The interaction of factor Va with platelet membranes requires expressionofphosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of activated platelets or endothelial cells. The long-term goal of thisproject is to use integrated molecular, structural and biophysical approaches to understand the interaction offactor Va with biological membranes. A membrane binding site was localized to the factor V C2 domainand the structures of two crystal forms of this domain have been elucidated. These structures havesuggested a working model for the interaction of factor Va with phospholipid membranes that includes:(1)immersion of exposed hydrophobic residues in the apolar membrane core; (2) stereospecific interactionswith PS head groups and (3) favorable electrostatic contacts of basic side chains with negatively chargedmembrane phosphate groups. Several aspects of this model have been validated. The indole side chains oftwo tryptophans located on a mobile solvent exposed loop within the C2 domain insert into the membranebilayer and are required for high affinity membrane binding. Tyrosine and leucine residues located in ananalogous location within the homologous factor V C1 domain play a role in binding to membranescontaining low concentrations of PS. The goals of the present study are to validate and refine our workingmodel for the association of factor Va with biological membranes. The specific aims of the present proposalare to define the PS specificity pocket(s) and membrane binding sites within the factor V C1 and C2 domainsand to determine their contribution to prothrombinase assembly on both phospholipid vesicles and cellularmembranes. Binding sites will be defined using recombinant factor Va mutants, recombinant light chaindomains, scFv antibodies and soluble phospholipid analogues. Binding interactions will be characterizedusing quantitative fluorescence binding assays and functional prothrombinase assays. We hypothesize thatcomplex interactions between factor Va and PS containing membranes allow for the fine regulation of theprothrombinase complex. The proposed experiments could lead to novel targets for anti-thrombotic therapy.PERFORMANCE'SITE(S) (organization, city,.state)Duke University, Durham, North CarolinaPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Kane, William H.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "In the past granting period, we learned that a fundamental mechanismof aging is conserved from yeast toanimals. Thus, yeast is a valuable model for at least some important aspects of aging in higher organisms. Aspecific gene, SIR2, is conserved in organisms from bacteria to humans. This gene clearly regulates aging bypromoting longevity in yeast and C. elegans, suggesting that its effects will prove to be general. The activity ofSir2p is to deacetylate proteins when provided with the co-substrate, NAD (nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide).Our studies in yeast indicate that the replicative aging of mother cells can be extended by calorie restriction, andthat this extension requires Sir2p. Since calorie restriction is the only intervention known to extend life span inmammals, these findingsmay have broad implications. We have further learned that the known effects of Sir2pon genomic silencing are pertinent to yeast aging. In the next period we propose to study the mechanism ofSir2p-mediated silencing in greater detail by analyzingsir2 mutations genetically and biochemically. We furtherpropose to use a combination of yeast genetic and molecular approaches to define the specificmetabolicmechanism by which calorie restriction extends life span and how this might relate to Sir2p. In addition, we willprobe the intriguing link between sojourns in stationary phase and yeast replicative aging. This particularstudymight provide a conceptual link between the aging of dividing and post-mitotic cells. Finally, we will begin ananalysis of two new genes, SSD1 and MPT5, that affect yeast aging in a SIR2-independent way. Theseexperiments will add to a substantial base of knowledge of aging in the simple budding yeast and will be aplatform for studies of aging in higher organisms, includingmammals.3ERFCRMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Massachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Avenue, 68-280Cambridge, MA 02139KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The ribosome, as the site where genetic information is translated into polypeptides which subsequently foldinto proteins, and as the target site for antibiotic action, is an organelle with eminent public health relevance.X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are the main tools to probe ribosomalstructure. RNA has emerged as the most important component of the ribosome, acting as a structuralscaffold and promoting most of the functionally important interactions with mRNA and tRNAs, as well as thepeptidyl moeity. Understanding the dynamics of RNA in these interactions will be key to the understandingof ribosomal function. Now that atomic structures of ribosomal subunits of prokaryotes are available,theexploration of RNA dynamics can be approached by a combination of cryo-EM of functional states, flexiblefitting of X-ray structures, and molecular modeling and molecular dynamic simulations. Pioneering contributions by this lab in the study of ribosome structure and function using cryo-EM, someof which were made in pursuing the goals of the previous funding period of this grant, position us well to takeon some of these challenges. This renewal proposal describes a four-year research plan incollaborationwith leading experts in ribosome biochemistry, molecular modeling, flexible fitting, and molecular dynamics.The Specific Aims are centered at the exploration of key events of decoding and translocation, recorded asthree-dimensional snapshots by cryo-EM, and the inference of the conformational dynamics of the ribosome,and the dynamics of ribosome-ligand interactions from such snapshots. For both decoding andtranslocation, additional transition states will be trapped for cryo-EM visualization. Attempts will be made toobtain these maps, as well as the density maps of existing states, with resolutions in the range of 7 A toprovide more stringent constraints in atomic modeling. We believe that the interdisciplinary efforts proposedare likely to advance the understanding of the molecular basis of translation.PERFORMANCE SITli(S) (organization, city, state)Wadsworth Center, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York, 12201-0509PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): FRANK, JOACHIMKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Hypertonic saline (HS) resuscitation is a promising new approach in the prevention of tissue damage intrauma patients, because of its capacity to block neutrophil (PMN) activation. We havestudied the molecularmechanisms through which HS controls PMNfunction and havefound that HStriggers the release ofATP.ATP can augment PMNresponses via P2 receptors. ATP convertedto adenosine inhibits PMNactivation viaP1 receptors. We hypothesize that the balance between ATP and adenosine determines whether HSincreases or dampens PMNfunction. Inthe following three Specific Aims, we proposeto define thecomponents that control this ATP/adenosine balance and determine pharmaceutical approaches to shift ittoward adenosine, and thus towardinhibition of PMNfunction. Specific Aim 1:ATPrelease and P2receptor activation: Themechanisms of ATP release will bestudied, a novel method for real-time monitoring of ATP release will be established, and P2 receptorsubtype expression and colocalization with sites of ATP release and hydrolysis will be assessed. Specific Aim 2)Adenosine formation and P1receptor activation:Thedynamics of expressionand colocalization of ecto-enzymesgenerating and hydrolyzing adenosine, specifically alkaline phosphatase, adenosine deaminase, and of the P1 receptors that are activated by adenosine will be studied.

      "Membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46) is a complement regulatory protein that binds C3b andC4band serves as a cofactor for their limited protedytic degradation. A major developmentduring the pastgrant cycle was the discovery that mutations in CD46 predispose to atypical hemotytlc uremic syndrome(aHUS). This finding has an Immediate impact on treatment options since renal transplantation would becurative in CD46 deficiency. This is especially significant since aHUS can be a life-threatening conditionthat recurs in patients (usually youngchildren) with about 50%developing renal failure. Atypical HUSisnow recognized as a disease of complement deregulation due to mutations in complement regulatoryproteins. We will address how CD46 deficiency prodtepoeesto aHUS. A major goal of this grant is to characterize CD46's regulatory activity in situ. In patients with aHUS andtheir families, we will 1) establish a facility to identify mutations and determine the functional repertoire ofthe mutant proteins; 2) use model systems(CHOcells expressing the mutant proteins, EB virustransformed human B lymphocytes from aHUS families, and human endothelial cells), assess Inhibitoryactivity in situ; RNAiwill be employed to create cells with a specific inhibitor deficiency state; 3) employscFv-complement regulator(s) chimeras to target inhibitors to RBCs and endothelial cells in order to correctthe deficiency and to define the most potent inhibitory mix of regulators to block complement activation; 4)monitor membrane movements of regulators as they are cross-linked with Abs and pathogens and inresponse to complement activation. A theme underlying these specific alms is to explorethe processwhereby the host limits complement activation on altered and injured self cells. This phenomenon wehavetermed TRACS, for targeted and restricted activation of the complement system, is little studied. Wepropose that the profile of complement activation on self-tissue has unique purposes and distinct featurescompared to its activation on microbes. Our long term goal is to understand how this is accomplished usingCD46 deficiency In aHUS as the Illustrative example. Our proposal will help define how deficiency of the complement regulator CD46 predisposes to humandisease hemolytic uremic syndromeas well as develop ways to deliver regulators to treat such conditions.PERFORMANCE SlTE(6) (orrjinizjitlon, city, ¿al*)Washington University, St. Louis, MissouriPHS 398(Rev.Oft/04) P*0*2 FormP¿o¿J Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Atkinson, John P.

      "Memory impairments and subjectivecomplaints of memory loss are among the most common features of cognitive aging.The long-term goals of this project are to facilitate understanding the effects of aging on memory processes, and toprovide a basis for developing techniques and interventions that can enhance memory functions of older adults in theireveryday lives. The proposed experiments will contribute to these goals by clarifying the effects of aging on sourcememory (remembering when and where previous experiences occurred)and false memory (inaccuraterecollections). Thefirst specific aim is to evaluate the hypothesis that older adults can use a  distinctiveness heuristic  ¿a strategywhereby participants demand access to distinctive recollections to support a positive memory decision - to reduce robustfalse recognition effects that are observed after participants study lists of semantically related words or categorizedpictures. Experiments 1-6test this hypothesis by manipulating conditions that do or do not allow participants to relyon a distinctiveness heuristic to reduce false recognition. The second specific aim is to extend the distinctivenessheuristic hypothesis to other forms of false recognition. This objective will be accomplished by examining the effectsof distinctive encoding in a paradigm where false memory effects are created by repeating new items on a recognitiontest (Experiments 7-10), and by testing the hypothesis that younger adults will show greater  false recognitionreversal  than older adults because the effect depends on memory processes that are impaired in older adults, andcannot be produced by invoking a distinctiveness heuristic (Experiment11-13). The third specific aim is to characterizesource memory in older adults and examine its role in the generation and suppression of false memories. To do so, weassess the hypothesis that memory for partial source information is preserved in older adults and can provide a basisfor using the distinctiveness heuristic (Experiments 14-16), and also evaluate whether older adults can use alikelihood heuristic to reduce source memory errors (Experiment 17). The fourth specific aim ¿ to evaluate thecontribution of conceptual information to age-related increases in false recognition of categorized pictures and novelpatterns ¿will be accomplished by attempting to interfere with verbal labeling (Experiment 18) and by manipulatingthe presence or absence of verbal labels for novel visual patterns (Experiment 19). Taken together, the proposed studieswill provide new insights into memory distortions that accompany aging and what can be done to minimize them.3ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Harvard University: Cambridge, MAKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This proposal investigates the roles of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in chondrogenesis. Throughanalysis of mice lacking BMPR1A and/or BMPR1B, we demonstrated that signaling through these receptorsis essential for chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance. These studies showed thatBMPR1A and BMPR1B have overlapping functions at the condensation stage, but did not reveal the extentto which they collaborate at later stages. Moreover, while ActRI is insufficient on its own to support chondro-genesis beyond the condensation stage, the extent to which BMPR1A and/or BMPR1B alone can promotechondrogenesis is unknown. Resolution of this issue is important for future strategies targeted towardactivation of specific BMP receptors in order to elicit defined responses in tissue engineering applications orin repair in vivo. We address these issues in Aim 1through characterization ActRI/Bmprla andActRI/Bmprlb double mutants, and through the generation of mice in which loss of BMP receptor functioncan be induced at late gestation stages. It is likely that BMPs transduce the majority of their effects throughSmads, but it is unknown whether or not all 3 BMP-specific Smads are required for chondrogenesis, orwhether Smads have distinct vs. overlapping functions. We address this issue in aim two. Studies ofBmpr1a/1b compound mutants uncovered evidence that loss of BMP signaling is accompanied by increasedoutput from FGF pathways. This finding suggests that BMP and FGF pathways act antagonistically duringchondrogenesis, and raises the possibility that the relative balance between BMP and FGF signaling is amajor determinant of chondrocyte progression through the growth plate. We test this and identifydownstream components of FGF signaling pathways responsible for these effects in aim three throughconstruction of mice in which relative output from BMP and FGF pathways is altered, and through the use oflimb cultures. Analysis of BMP receptor mutants demonstrated that BMP pathways are essential forexpression of Ihh, the key regulator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the growth plate. It hasbeen shown in vitro that ERK1/2 antagonizes BMP signaling by directly phosphorylating, and therebyinactivating, BMP-specific Smads. In aim four, we test whether this mechanism is relevant to Ihh expressionin the growth plate. Understanding how BMPs control distinct aspects of chondrogenesis and how FGFsantagonize these effects is vital to understanding how BMPs can be utilized most optimally in tissueengineering applications, for cartilage repair and maintenance, and potentially for treatment ofchondrodysplasias caused by activating FGF mutations.University of California, Los AngelesDavid Geffen School of MedicineDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery2614 MacDonald Research Laboratories675 Charles E Young Dr. SouthLos Angeles, CA 90095PHS 398 (Rev.09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis, which remains a major health problem inmuch of the world, and is considered a potential biological weapon. The two main forms of disease, amebiccolitis and amebic liver abscess arise from complex interactions between the host and parasite. In theprevious funding period, we focused primarily on the host, and established new paradigms about the role ofinflammation and apoptosis in amebic disease. In this renewal we will return our focus to the parasite, andwill look at what we have termed the amebic virulence program: E. histolytica molecules that must beexpressed or suppressed to allow amebic invasion and survival within host tissues. We will define thevirulence program through a transcriptional analysis, and ask how the virulence repertoire differs betweenamebic trophozoites in culture, those that have invaded into the colonic mucosa, and trophozoites within theliver. We will attempt to identify the requisite components of this response, and determine whether blockingtheir expression can alter the course of amebic colitis or amebic liver abscess. We will test the hypothesis thathost macromolecules serve as triggers for the activation of the amebic virulence program, and test candidateamebic molecules for their role in recognizing host molecules and initiating the amebic virulence program:We will then determine whether blocking host macromolecule recognition, or signaling by amebic receptors,alters the course of amebic colitis. The above studies look at virulence in the context of amebic response tothe host. We will also investigate the inherent virulence repertoire of E. histolytica HM1:IMSS by looking atdifferences at the transcriptional level between HM1:IMSS and the reduced virulence E. histolytica Rahman.When complete, these studies should provide new insights into the biology of E. histolytica, will further ourunderstanding of the pathophysiology of amebic colitis and amebic liver abscess, and will identify newvirulence factors that may play unique roles in amebic colitis or amebic liver abscess and could be targets fornew vaccines or therapeutics.ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization,city,state)Washington University660 South Euclid AvenueSt. Louis, MO63110PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Stanley, Samuel L, Jr.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Protein recognition of specific base sequences in double-helical DNA lies at the heart of many biologicalprocesses, including the regulation and expression of genetic information and site-specific recombination. Thelong-term objective of this project is to use restriction endonucleases as models to understand the structural andenergetic factors that determine specificity in site-specific DNA-protein interactions. Previous work with EcoRI and BamHl endonucleases has established a rigorous thermodynamic andkinetic basis for a quantitative understanding of the changes in free energy (AG¿), enthalpy (AH¿) and entropy(AS0) in formation of protein-DNA complexes. The approach is aimed at uniting structural and energeticperspectives on specificity and at testing the generality of the principles adduced. It is now proposed to determinehow molecular strain (DNA bending in the EcoRV complex; electrostatic repulsion in the BamRL complex)affects thermodynamic parameters (AH¿, AS0 and AC¿p) and to determine how particular sequence contexts (i.e.,outside a DNA recognition site) act to modulate specificity and to adjust molecular strain in the DNA complexesof ¿coRI and EcoRV endonucleases. Existing and newly-engineered mutants of EcoRl endonuclease will be usedto determine how the introduction of new favorable interactions or the elimination of unfavorable interactionsrelaxes specificity by modifying the structure of the protein-DNA interface, the thermodynamics of bindingand/or the cleavage kinetics of the system. The BamHI and EcoRV endonucleases will be used for quantitativecalibration of the excluded-cosolute method of evaluating H2O release during protein-DNA association, and tocompare experimental results with computational predictions.PhHhORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, aty, state)Department of Biological Sciences, Univ. of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15260KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Our objective is to elucidate the structure,function, and mechanism of the ubiquinone (Q)-mediated electrontransfer complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. During past support periods we have established protocols forsite-directed mutagenesis coupled with in vivo and in vitro reconstitutionto study some of the structural and functionalrelationships in succinate-Q reductase (SQR) and ubiquinol-cytochromec reductase (QCR). We have crystallized QCR,solved its structure to 2.9 A resolution and indicated that QCR is a functional dimer and that the catalytic cycle of thecomplex involves movement of the head domain of iron-sulfur protein (ISP). Functional evidence for such movementwas obtained from characterization of Rhodobacter sphaeroides bc\\ complexes with altered ISP necks. In addition toelectron and proton transfer, we have discovered and studied two more functions of QCR, superoxide radical generationand mitochondrial processing peptidase activity (MPP). In the next grant period we will focus on the elucidation of themechanism of electron transfer and proton translocationin QCR and of electron transfer in SQR. The approaches to beused include kinetic rate determinations, various spectroscopic measurements, organic synthesis, resolution andreconstitution, molecular genetics, and protein crystallography. The specific aims are: (A) to obtain structuraldata for mechanistic studies, including the Q-binding at the Qo sitepocket, the proton transfer path, structure water, hydrogen bonding, and the interaction domain between cytochromes c\\and c. This will be achieved by obtaining high resolution QCR structure and by X-ray analysis of QCR crystals indifferent redox states, in the presence of non-oxidizable Q derivatives, or with cytochrome c; (B) to elucidate the reactionmechanisms for electron and proton transfer in QCR. This will be achieved by investigating the movement of the headdomain of ISP via functional analysis of mutantshaving an intersubunitcystine bridge, salt bridge, or hydrogen bond atthe interface between cytochrome b and ISP, and via the conformational changes of cytochrome b or c1? at the interfacewith ISP, during the oxidation-reduction cycle or binding with different Qo site inhibitors; by determining the acidinduced intra-molecular electron transfer rates between 2Fe2S and heme ct using a proton caged compound activated bypulse laser; and by probing the nature of the intra-molecularpath of QH2 in QCR by site directed mutagenesis; (C) tosynthesize Q-derivatives and inhibitors for protein:Q interaction studies; (D) to elucidate electron transfer mechanisms inSQR by establishing the identity of QPs2; reconstitution of SQR from recombinantQPs subunits and isolated SDH;identification of SDH docking site(s) in QPs subunits;and crystallization and 3-D structural analysis of mitochondrialSQR. Successful elucidation of the reaction mechanismsfor electron and/or proton transfer of SQR and QCR willprovide information crucial to understandingthe mitochondrialbioenergetic process and thus help in drug design formitochondrial related diseases. Also, since the quinonereactive sites are responsible for superoxide generation and Qcan scavenge singlet oxygen, detailed knowledge of the structure-function relationships and reaction mechanisms of Q-mediated electron transfer should provide valuable informationfor the study of oxidative stress. This information will beuseful in pharmaceutical investigations of cytotoxicityand the aging process.PERFORMANCE S1TE(S) (organization, city, state)Department of Biochemistry & Molecular BiologyOklahoma State UniversityStillwater, OK 74078KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Patients affected by pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-Ib) display variable degrees of hypocalcemia andhyperphosphatemia due to PTH-resistance. These individuals show, however, no evidence for Albright'shereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and are thus distinct from patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type la(PHP-la) and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (pPHP). Because of the selective resistance to a singlehormone, PTH, PHP-Ib was initially thought to be caused by mutations in the PTH-receptor, now referred to asthe PTH/PTHrP receptor. However, our laboratory and other groups excluded such mutations. Moreimportantly, PTH/PTHrP receptor mutations, either activating or inactivating, are now known to lead to severeabnormalities in the regulation of mineral ion homeostasis and bone development, which is different from the oftenvery mild laboratory abnormalities observed in PHP-Ib patients. This suggested that the genetic defect lies in a yetunknown gene with a prominentrole in regulating the expression of the PTH/PTHrP receptor and/or down-streamsignaling proteins. A genome-wide scan was therefore conducted and revealed linkage of the autosomal dominantform of PHP-Ib to chromosome 20ql3.3, which comprises GNAS1 at its telomeric boundary. These studiesfurthermore showed that the disease is paternally imprinted, i.e. hormonal resistance is only transmitted to the nextgeneration if the disease-associated allele is inherited from an obligate female carrier. This mode of inheritance issimilar to the findings in kindreds with PHP-Ia/pPHP, two related disorders that are caused by heterozygous,inactivating mutations in one of the thirteen GNAS1 exons encoding Gsa. Besides encoding the ubiquitoussignaling protein, GNAS1 gives rise to at least four additional coding and non-coding/non-translated transcripts,and the promoter region for several of these transcripts undergoes parent-specific methylation and thusinactivation. One of these epigenetic changes, i.e. a loss of methylation at the A/B exon (also referred to exon 1Aor I') has thus far been shown to occur specifically in patients affected by PHP-Ib. However, the geneticmutation leading to this methylation abnormality and presumably to PTH-resistance appears to be located at least50 kb up-stream of the epigenetic defect, most likely in an intronic regulatory region. We now propose to identifythis genetic mutation(s) through nucleotide sequence analysis, additional linkage studies, or an in vivo approachwith transgenic animals, and to explore the molecular mechanism(s) underlyingPTH-resistance in the renal cortex.PERFO1RMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Massachusetts General HospitalBoston, MassachusettsKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Discoveries during the prior period of support demonstrated that PKCe is a key enzyme that down-regulatesGABAA receptor function through three mechanisms: (1) modulation of allosteric sensitivity viaphosphorylation of receptor subunits; (2) down-regulation of cell surface abundance, possibly throughphosphorylation of the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), and (3) down-regulation of GABAA receptorfunction. In this continuation, we will extend this work by examining PKCe phosphorylation of 32 and y2SGABAA receptor subunits, the regulation of NSF by PKCe, the role of cofilin-1 and cyclophilin A as possiblePKCe substrates that regulate GABAA receptor sensitivity to allosteric drugs, and the role of increased a2subunit abundance in the striatum in mediating PKCe null phenotypes. Studies will use transfected cell linesexpressing specific receptor subunit combinations and an analog-sensitive mutant of PKCs. Other studieswill use primary neurons cultured from PKCe null and wild type mice. Phosphorylation sites will be identifiedby mass spectrometry and phosphorylation site alanine mutants will be constructed to determine if thesemutations prevent phosphorylation by PKCe. GABAA receptor currents in intact cells will be examined bywhole cell patch clamp. a2 subunits will be overexpressed in the striatum to see if overexpression reducesalcohol consumption in wild type mice. An RNAi vector will be developed to knock down ot2in the striatum todetermine if decreasing expressing of a2 subunits increases alcohol consumption in PKCe null mice. Thesestudies will provide novel molecular information about how PKCe regulates the sensitivity of GABAAreceptors to ethanol and will provide new information about how PKCe regulates GABAA receptor cell surfaces1 ability and function.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research CenterEmeryville, CAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Messing, Robert O.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The transcription factor NF-icB plays a criticalrole in innate immune responses by augmenting the expressionof many inducible, immediate response genes, including IL-1,IL-2, IL-2Ra, IL-6, IL-8,1L-12,TNF-a, p-IFN,GM-CS r, COX-2, E-selectin and serum amyloid A protein. NF-KB acts as a critical co-ordinating element inthe body's response to infection and injury, and thus is an important mediator of innate immunity. Recentstudies demonstrating the importance of NF-KB activation by signaling through the Toll-receptors hashighlighted their evolutionarilyconserved role in host response to pathogens. It is also an essential element forthe replication of different viruses, including HIV. NF-KB also serves as an important anti-apoptotic factor inmany biological systems and its aberrant activation has been linked to the development of certain forms ofcancer. Therefore understanding how NF-KB activity is regulated has great relevance for the development ofnovel therapies for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. The primary long-term objective of ourresearch is to determine how the signals from the Toll-receptors, that induce the activity of NF-KB, aretransduced and lead to the mounting of innate immune responses. In this application we propose to study theToll-receptor signal transduction pathway by focusing on two novel adapter proteins, ECSIT and X, that wehave recently isolated. We will use a variety of approaches, including generation and analysis of gene targetedanimals, to study these molecules. We will also try to isolate potential adapter proteins that bind to the Toll-receptors and substitute for MyD88. We wish to delineate the sequence of events that are responsible for theinduction of the 1KBkinase (IKK) complex activity in response to signalingfrom Toll-receptors. In particularwe wish to understand the role of NEMO/IKKy, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex in the activationprocess, Finally we will study the possible mechanisms by which the IKK proteins facilitate the proteosomaldegradation of phosphorylated and ubiquitinated 1KB substrates.PERFORMANCE S1TE(S) (organization, city, state)Yale University School of MedicineNew Haven.

      "The Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) was created in 1993 and offers .highly qualified Ph.D. candidates the opportunity to learn the theory and practice of modern cellular and molecular biology while conducting laboratory research on problems with direct clinical relevance. CMM is an independent Graduate Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine with separate admissions, a special curriculum, and is certified to award the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). Now in its tenth year, CMM matriculates -15-20 incoming students selected from -175 applicants every year, producing a steady state of -80-90 students. A total of 42 students (as of May 20, 2004) have graduated from the Program, which has nearly doubled in size over the past five years. CMM faculty members are from clinical departments (81 individuals) and basic science departments (25 individuals). They were selected because of their successful independent laboratory programs, NIH funding, and their suitability to serve as mentors for young scientists. Importantly, these faculty members pursue research at cellular and molecular levels on human diseases including: cancer; cardiopulmonary and vascular disorders; neurobiology and neurological disorders; immunological and infectious diseases; metabolic, developmental, and genetic defects. The first year curriculum provides rigorous lecture courses in human biology ( Introduction to the Human Body ), the Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease, and basic sciences: Molecular Biology and Genomics; Pathways and Regulation; Cell Structure and Dynamics; Fundamentals of Genetics; Human Genetics, and Immunology. First year students also participate in small group discussions with CMM faculty, attend Topics in Cellular and Molecular Medicine Seminars, and partake in a tutorial presented by upper-class CMM honors students. First year students perform three research rotations in CMM faculty laboratories before selecting a thesis laboratory. Second year students take the oral graduate board examination in the fall period, and complete two additional required courses: Pharmacology, and a choice of either Virology or Biochemical and Biophysical Principles. In subsequent years, students take four elective courses and attend seminars and journal clubs offered by the CMM Program as well as in their thesis departments. The goal of CMM is to train young scientists for careers studying human diseases at cellular and molecular levels. We expect that most CMM graduates will take academic positions in medical schools pursuing research in clinical departments, while some may choose to pursue research in industry.

      "One of the most exciting advances in understanding the molecular actions of growth hormone (GH) was the identification of the tyrosine (Tyr) kinase JAK2 as a receptor-associated signaling molecule for the GH receptor (GHR). In this competing renewal we shall continue to test the hypothesis that activation of JAK2 in response to GH is a required initial step in GH signal transduction that results in the phosphorylation of multiple Tyr in GHR and JAK2. These phosphorylated Tyr serve as binding sites for molecules in various GH signaling pathways. During the past funding period, multiple signaling proteins and signaling pathways for GH were identified and/or characterized. Some of these signaling proteins were found to be activated as a consequence of binding to JAK2 (SH2-B, SIRPa) and others as a consequence of binding to GHR (SHP-2, StatS). The docking site for others remains ambiguous (She, IRS, Stats 1 and 3). Efforts were initiated to identify the Tyr within GHR and JAK2 that are phosphorylated by JAK2, with 3 phosphorylated Tyr within JAK.2 being identified. In Aims land 2 of the current proposal, Tyr within JAK2 and GHR that are phosphorylated in response to GH will be identified and their regulation studied using a combination of 2 dimensional phosphopeptide mapping, phosphospecific antibodies and mass spectrometry. Aim 3 will use microarray technology to identify populations of genes that are regulated by GH and determine whether expression of specific subpopulations of these genes require specific phosphorylated tyrosines in GHR and JAK2. Aim 4 will determine which phosphorylated Tyr within GHR and JAK2 bind to known GH signaling proteins. Finally, Aim 5 will use yeast 2-hybrid system to identify new signaling proteins that bindpreferentially to activated, tyrosyl phosphorylated JAK2 and characterize their regulation by GH. To identifyproteins that bind to specific phosphorylated tyrosines within GHR and JAK2, A expression libraries will be screened with phosphopeptides corresponding to phosphorylated Tyr containing sequences within GHR and JAK2. These studies will provide needed insight into: 1) the initiating steps in GHR signal transduction; 2) new signaling proteins and genes that are regulated by GH; 3) new signaling pathways utilized by GH; 4) the mechanisms by which these pathways are initiated; and 5) pathways that interact, either because they compete for the same binding sitein GHR and/or JAK2, lie downstream of a common initial signaling molecule or require input form multiple upstream pathways. This insight should be of great assistance in delineating the molecular mechanisms by which GHelicits its diverse effects on growth and metabolism as well as in deciphering similarities and differences in the signaling pathways utilized by the cytokines that activate JAK kinases. Ultimately, it should facilitate the designthe therapeutic agents that target specific growth and metabolic pathways regulated by GH and/or these other cytokines.'ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Michigan Medical SchoolKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This proposal examines the hypothesis that agonist-induced trafficking of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is required for the initiation and termination of signal transduction, and that defects result in uncontrolled stimulation and disease. The molecular mechanisms and physiological roles of substance P (SP)- induced trafficking of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NKIR) will be examined at the level of the cell and the whole animal. It is important to understand the mechanisms of NK1R signaling in view of the pathophysiological roles of this receptor in neurogenic inflammation, pain and intestinal motility. NK1R regulation will be studied in transfected cell lines, endothelial cells and enteric neurons in short-term culture, and in knockout and transgenic mice. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanism of SP-stimulated endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of the NK1R. The role of the clathrin adapter p-arrestin, and of dynamin and Rab GTPases in NK1R trafficking will be examined by expression of dominant negative mutants, and by studying neurons from p- arrestin knockout mice. The role of the cytoskeleton and of endosomal acidification and phosphatases will be examined using specific drugs Aim 2 will define the importance of NK1R trafficking for the initiation of signal transduction. The role of p-arrestins, Rabs and the cytoskeleton in NKlR-mediated MAP kinase activation will be determined using reagents developed in Aim 1. These studies will define the role of p-arrestins as molecular scaffolds that recruit and organize components of the MAPK cascade. Aim 3 will define the importance of NK1R trafficking in desensitization and resensitization of signaling. The role of G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) and p-arrestins in desensitization will be determined by expression of dominant negative mutants and by studying neurons from knockout mice. The importance of Rabs, the cytoskeleton and endosomal sorting forresensitization will be examined using reagents from Aim 1. Aim 4 will determine whether defects in mechanisms of NK1R desensilization result in prolonged SP signaling and disease. SP signaling will be examined in mice deficient in GRKs or p-arrestins, or expressing a desensitization and internalization-defective mutant NK1R (NK1R8325, a naturally occurring NK1R variant). The effects of SP on intestinal motility and neurogenic inflammation will be examined, with the expectation that defects in desensitization will result in exaggerated motor and inflammatory responses. Together, the results of these experiments will provide new information about GPCR signaling, and will define how defects in signal transduction can cause disease.PERFORMANCE SFTEfS) (organization, city, state) University of California, San Francisco Harvard UniversityKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The gas, carbon monoxide (CO), is produced physiologically by catabolism of heme via heme oxygenase. One of the isoforms of heme oxygenase, HO-2, is expressed in highest concentration in the brain where it resides in neurons,vascular endothelium and smooth muscle. It generates CO from cellular heme. This application is based on preliminary data that suggest carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous mediator in the newborn cerebral circulation. These preliminary data include detection of heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) in the cerebral vasculature, cerebrovascular dilator responses to exogenously applied CO and to heme oxygenase substrate, and measurements of CO productionby cerebral microvessels and endothelium. The likelihood that CO will prove to be a physiologically significant intercellular messenger molecule is high. The research proposed is designed to pursue the unifying hypothesis that CO is an integral component of microvascular control in neonatal cerebral circulation. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims will be addressed in newborn pigs, in vivo, and using cells isolated from newborn pigs, in primary culture: 1. Determine the functional significance of CO in regulation of cerebral microvascular tone, 2. Localize andcharacterize heme oxygenase of the neonatal cerebral vasculature, 3. Investigate mechanisms of CO induced modifications of cerebral microvascular tone. To accomplish these aims, techniques allowing investigation of intact cerebral microcirculation, isolated cerebral microvessels, and primary culture of cells from newborn pigs will beemployed. Such research is unique by studying intact cerebral circulation and investigating, at the cellular and molecular levels, the mechanisms responsible for controlling the production of the mediator, CO, and the mechanisms by which CO can affect vascular tone. Cranial windows allow observation of cerebral circulation, collection of cortical periarachnoid fluid, and topical application of agonists, precursors and inhibitors. Levels and cellular distribution of heme oxygenase protein expression as well as enzyme activity and cellular mechanisms for controlling that activity will be examined. The cellular mechanisms by which CO may modify vascular tone will be studied at the level of membrane potential, ion channels, and second messengers. Disorders of the cerebral circulation in the newborn periodare major causes of morbidity and mortality and can result in life long disabilities in survivors. Control ofcerebrovascular circulation is easily impaired by pathological conditions. Therefore, better understanding of mechanisms of cerebromicrovascular humoral communication in newborns is needed badly.3ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of Tennessee, MemphisMemphis, TN 38163KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The long-range goal of this project is to define the interactionsin the transcriptioncomplex that regulatepausing and termination by RNA polymerase. Nascent RNA hairpins are important regulatory signals inbacteria, where pausing and termination are major components of genetic regulatory mechanisms. Pausingand premature termination also affect expression of genes in mammalian cells and viruses, notably genesinvolved in the development of cancer and in growth of the AIDS virus, HIV-1. In both bacteria andeukaryotes, specialized regulatory proteins modify the transcriptioncomplex to make it resistant to pausingand termination. Although significant progress has been made in understandingpausing, termination, andthe regulatory proteins that control these events, two alternativemodels remain possible. In one view,called the allosteric model, pause signals, termination signals, and regulatory proteins primarily affect the¿conformation of RNA polymerase. In the other, these signals and proteins primarily affect translocation ofa relatively rigid RNA polymerase on the RNA and DNA chains (the rigid-body model). Pausing andtermination by E. coli RNA polymerase and their regulation by the NusA, NusG, and RfaH proteins, andpausing by human RNA polymerase II have been developed as model systems. A combination of biochemical, genetic, and biophysical approaches will be used to distinguish theallosteric and rigid-body models of transcriptional regulation, and to characterize the mechanisms ofpausing, termination, and regulatory proteins that control them. Specific aims will be to (i) characterizeinteractions of RNA polymerase's flap-tip helix with RNA, NusA, and a70, and test how these interactionsaffect catalysis in the active site; (ii) determine the location of the RNA 3' end in paused and nonpausedtranscription elongation complexes; (Hi)determine the kinetic mechanisms of elongation, pausing, andtermination; (iv) map interactions between RNA polymerase and pause and terminator hairpins; and (v)determine the sites at which RfaH and NusG interact with RNA polymerase and the mechanisms by whichthey regulate transcript elongation.

      "The brain's opioid system plays an important role in reward mechanisms and recently it has been targeted in treatment efforts using the opiate antagonist, naltrexone. Our recent findings provide strong evidence for dampened CNS opioid activity in the offspring of alcoholics, an abnormality predating heavy alcohol drinking. However, we know little about the underlying differences in the endogenous opioid system between healthy individuals and the alcohol dependent population. Indeed, little human data exists which address the question ofwhether there are abnormalities in the opioid system in alcohol dependent, individuals and whether such differences are a consequence of genetic determinants, or a consequence of heavy alcohol use or a combination of both. The lack of knowledge of the role of endogenous opioids in alcoholism lias been due primarily to difficulties in making measurements in human subjccis. However, thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can provide useful measurements of endogenous opioid activity. This is because the HPA axis is modulated by hypothalamic opioid activity. Induction of opioid receptor blockade stimulates the HPA axis allowing a noninvasive, functional assessment of the hypothalamic opioid system . We propose to utilize this neuroendocrine strategy to measure opioid activity in alcohol dependent persons at various stages of their disorder. In Specific Aim 1, we will measure opioid activity in alcohol dependent individuals in early abstinencemonitored on the CRC and compare to controls. We will determine each subject's sensitivity to naloxone by venerating a dose response curve and then calculating the dose of naloxone required to induce a half-maxima!hormone response (ED50). We will relate this measurement of opioid activityto behavioral and physiologicalmeasures such as alcohol craving, mood and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.Alcoholics and controls will be equally representedby fami.y history positive (FHP) and family history negative (FHN) subjects. In Specific Aim II , we will measurethe change in ED50 values during eightweeks of supervised abstinenceon the CRC in alcohol dependent subjects compared to the control group. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine if naloxone sensitivity (ED50) measurementsobtained during controlled abstinence on the CRCpredicts the time to relapse after discharge. This study will provide information on the activity of the endogenous opioidsystem as a function of alcoholism and as a function of family history of alcoholism. These findings will impact ourunderstanding of the neurochemical factors that predispose to- and maintain heavy alcohol drinking.PERFORMANCE S\\TE($) (organization, city, state}The Johns Hopkins University School of MedicineBaltimore, MarylandKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD),Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by adult onset,progressive neurologic dysfunction, and a paucity of effective therapies. These common disordersproduce substantial disability, and their importance to public health is expected to increase as thepopulation ages. One or more causative genes have now been isolated for familial forms of each ofthese four devastating neurologic illnesses, making possible the development of transgenic mousemodels. Although such animal models now exist, the exact mechanisms by which mutant genescause neurologic diseases remains unclear. Unless the etiologic mechanisms underlyingneurodegenerative diseases are clearly identified,rational therapeutic interventions will be impossible.The neurotransmitter glutamate has been implicated as a causative factor in the etiology ofneurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, one class of glutamate receptors, the metabotropicglutamate receptors (mGluRs), may be specifically abnormal in many of the neurodegenerativedisorders. This project will examine metabotropic glutamate receptors in transgenic mouse models of AD,PD, HD, and ALS using ligand binding, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemstry, and Westernblotting. Alteration of mGluR expression level is also predicted to have direct implications for theabnormal synaptic functioning which is characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we willalso explore glutamate-related intracellular signaling pathways in the brains of transgenic mice.Finally, if mGluR dysfunction is an important part of disease etiology, drugs targeting mGluRs mayameliorate symptoms in certain of these models. We will test if administration of mGluR-activemedications improves clinical outcome in mouse models of these diseases.PERFORMANCE blTE(S) (organization, city, state)Neurology ServiceMassachusetts General HospitalFruit StreetBoston, MA 02114 KEY PERSONNEL.

Such socioeconomic (SES) gradients in health are present throughout the lifespan persisting into the eighth decade. Changes of health with age are heterogeneous with importantenvironmental determinants, which include SES. We will establish patterns and determinants of change of health inrelation to age and SES. Further, we will examine whether the causes and consequences of within-person changes ofhealth with age are different from those found cross-sectionally. In the British civil service there is an inverse socialgradient in morbidity and mortality. The broad long term objective of the Whitehall II study is to explain thesesocioeconomic differences in health. The WhitehallII study of 10 308 male and female civil servants, aged 35-55 yearsat sntry (1985-1988), was established to examine role of specific psychosocial, lifestyle, biochemical and physiologicalfactors as possible explanations of these inequalities. True age related changes in these exposures, or cumulativeexposure measured longitudinally, are hypothesized to predict changes in SES differences in health with age. At the 10year follow up of the cohort, NIA support funded collection of data to repeat outcome measures of health functioning,costive functioning, components of the metabolic syndrome and ApoE genotyping. The aims of the proposal are: 1. To describe and explain patterns of change with age in health status in relation to SES. 2. To determine if the gradient in health functioning differs from pre-retirement to retirement. 3. To examinethe relationship between SES and change in cognitive function with age. 4. to investigate specific biological pathways linking SES by examining the causes and consequences of their change with age. The Whitehall II study is uniquely po:ised to address these questions, offering: civil service employment grade as an excellent measure of SES; longitudinal design with participants comparatively young at entry allowingthe detection of antecedents of change; repeated measures of exposures; a wide range of exposure data; substantial power to detect age-related change, and its interaction with SES; wide range of health outcomes includinghealth and cognitive functioning, components of the metabolic syndrome, mortality, non-fatal diagnoses and sickness absence. We now request funding to analyze the data collected to date and to contribute to specific elements of the 15year follow-up of the cohort. With NIA support for Phase 7, we will be able to build on Whitehall II. It will enable us to accumulate more endpoints and track health functioning into older age, relate them to early life and mid-life exposures, and thereby allow us to establish psychosocial and biological pathways of disease and health inequalities.PERFORMANCE S\\TG(S)(organization, city, state)International Centre for Health & SocietyDepC of Epidemiology & Public HealthUniversity College London1-1!)

      "The development of EBV and KSHV driven lymphomas in the oral cavity is a serious clinical issue in HIVinfected subjects. Despite its relatively frequent occurrence in some geographic areas, including SouthAmerica, little is known how the herpesvirus specific immunity or lack thereof, is associated with diseasecontrol. In particular essentially no data exist regarding the impact of acute HIV infection on the pre-existingEBV and KSHV specific immunity and its consequences for later disease manifestation. This lack ofknowledge is largely due to logistical difficulties to examine the herpesvirus-specific cellular immuneresponse in individuals immediately before and after HIV infection. The availability of a closely monitoredcohort of individuals at high risk for HIV infection, combined with detailed immune analyses would overcomethis important gap in our understanding how immune events during acute HIV infection predisposeindividuals for long-term control of herpesviral infections. The present study aims to establish such as cohortand to assess EBV and KSHV specific immune responses on a single epitope level before and after HIVinfection. Using sensitive and multi-parameter flow-cytometryapproaches the proposed studies will help toassess whether HIV infection leads to a complete loss of some herpesvirus specific T cell responses orwhether HIV infection leads to a possibly transient functional silencing of these reactivities. Comparing bloodsamples to cells obtained form tonsilar biopsies, the studies will address whether the changes in theperipheral blood are a consequence of profound immune aberrations in the tonsil, an important site of viralreplication for orally transmitted viruses. The tonsil samples will also allow to perform viral gene expressionanalyses in projects 2 and 3 of this proposal, helping to link detected immune responses to the presence orabsence of viral antigens in this site. Together, the analyses in project 4 will provide unique insight into theearly immune events that surround acute HIV infection and that may determine herpesvirus control in theseco-infected subjects. Performing these analyses in a untreated HIV cohort in Lima, Peru will also deepen ourunderstanding of cellular immunity against herpesvirus infections common to this geographic area andfrequently associated with disease manifestation in the oral cavityMassachusetts General Hospital/PARC - Boston, MAAsociacion Civil IMPACTA Salud y Educacion, Lima, PeruPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) .

      "The myc proto-oncogene functions normally in control of cell proliferation and, when deregulated, isprofoundly involved in the genesis of a wide spectrum of tumors. The Myc protein is a bHLHZ classtranscription factor which binds DNA through dimerization with the small bHLHZ protein, Max. Myc is but oneof several bHLHZ proteins (including the Mad family) which interact with Max and together comprise the Maxtranscription factor network. Interestingly the members of this regulatory network function as transcriptionalactivators or repressors and act to buffer or antagonize each others functions. The transcriptional activities ofthese proteins are mediated by direct recruitment of corepressors (Mad-Max recruits the mSin3-HDAC co-repressor complex to DNA) or co-activators. This application is directed towards understanding themolecular mechanisms through which specific components of the network function and their biological rolesin cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, development, and oncogenesis. The first Aim is focused on therole of the mSin3-HDAC repression complex which is involved in gene repression related to differentiationand signal transduction. The basis for the specific interaction between defined regions of mSin3 with specifictranscription factors (such as Mad) will be elucidated and used to define altered specificity mutants. Thebroad developmental role of mSin3A will be assessed through targeted gene deletion in mice. Aim 2employs the power of Drosophila to understand more deeply the functions of the network as a whole. Ourearlier work demonstrated that Drosophila and vertebrate Myc play direct roles in regulating cell growth(size). We propose to employ endoreplicating larval cells to delineate the key components in the dMyc anddMad growth regulation pathways. This will be done in part by characterizing null mutations in dmyc anddmad. We will analyze direct chromatin binding of Max network proteins. In Aim 3 we will use retroviral  genetagging  in myc transgenic mice with defined genetic backgrounds in order to identify and characterizegenes that cooperate with myc during lymphomagenesis. We will identify myc-cooperating genes underconditions of increased sensitivity to apoptosis (i.e. mdm2 hypomorphic mutant mice) or under conditionswhere myc function is no longer antagonized by Mad proteins (i.e. mad knockout mice). Such genes areexpected to define new functional pathways for myc in tumors.PERFORMANCE StTE(S) (organization, city, state)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Covance Research Products1100 Fairview Ave North 465 Swampbridge RoadP.O.

DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACEPROVIDED.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that breaking tolerance to tumor antigens is more easilyaccomplished by immunizing healthy donors compared with cancer patients, who may beimmunocompromised from the underlying disease or prior treatment. We propose testing a novel therapeuticstrategy combining cancer vaccine therapy with reduced-intensity conditioning, allogeneic stem celltransplantation (SCT), with the goal of transferring tumor antigen-specific immunity from stem cell donors topatients with myeloma to reduce the risk of relapse. This strategy is based on our previous preclinical andclinical studies demonstrating proof of principle in patients with multiple myeloma. Specifically, under anapproved FDA Investigational New Drug application, SCT donors were immunized with a safe, well-definedtumor vaccine, consisting of highly purified myeloma-derived idiotype protein. Direct transfer of myelomaidiotype-specific T-cell immunity from donor to recipient was observed after myeloablative bone marrowtransplantation and was associated with favorable long-term survival. In this project, we will determinewhether antigen-specific immunity, induced in the stem cell donor, can be passively transferred to theallogeneic SCT recipient (Specific aim 1) and determine the fine specificity, frequency, phenotype, andeffector function of adoptively transferred, idiotype-specific T cells (Specific aim 2). The higher T-cellcontent in the peripheral blood stem cell grafts is likely to enhance the transfer of idiotype-specific T cellsfollowing donor immunization. Furthermore, non-myeloablative conditioning may reduce the transplant-related mortality, improving the overall success of this novel treatment. The long-term goal of this project isto transfer highly enriched populations of idiotype-specific T cells from donor to recipient (i.e., educateddonor lymphocyte infusions), which may enhance the antitumor effect of the allograft without exacerbatinggraft-versus-host disease and thereby reduce the risk of relapse of myeloma.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of Texas M.

      "Inferences about the environmental influences of parental alcoholism on risk of childhood disorders such asAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Conduct Disorder, or Depression, which in turn predict increasedoffspring risk of alcohol use disorders and associated high-risk behaviors (eg: early onset of alcohol use), havebeen hindered by a failure to recognize (i) the confounding of genetic effects, and genotype x sharedenvironment interaction effects in the twin design, and (ii) the selection for high risk genetic backgrounds, butreduced environmental risk exposures, in adoption study designs. As an alternative, we propose a children-of-twins study, that builds upon our prior studies of a cohort of young adult Australian twins characterized by ahistory of heavy drinking and high rates of alcohol problems, in women as well as men. Comparison ofoutcomes in children exposed to both high genetic and high environmental risk (twin father is alcohol dependent[AD], or twin mother is AD or alcohol abuser [AB]: 'alcoholic'[ALC]), children exposed to reducedenvironmental risk but varying degrees of genetic risk (twin parent is unaffected, but parent's MZ, DZ female,or DZ male cotwin is alcoholic: 'high risk'), and children from control families (twin parent, and parent'scotwin, both unaffected), will enable us to identify high risk environmental exposures associated with parentalalcoholism that are predictive of offspring outcomes, with statistical control for genetic transmission of risk.Intake, 2-yr and in some cases 4-yr follow-up interviews will be conducted with the children's parents (aprojected N=1900 parents reporting about 3350 offspring aged 7 yrs and older, as well as about own andpartner's history of alcohol use and comorbid disorders) and with male and female offspring aged 11 yrs andolder (N=2260), and will be supplemented by intake interviews with co-parents of these offspring (N=1300).Hypotheses will be tested about the pathways by which alcoholism in the parental generation via genetictransmission and/or increased high-risk environmental exposures, is associated with increased risk ofpsychopathology and other high-risk outcomes in offspring, taking into consideration pre-conception factors I(mate selection), pre-natal risk-factors (maternal smoking and drinking), and post-natal factors (both factors Iassociated with the presence of an alcoholic parent in the home, and factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage Iassociated with parental absence or parental past history of ALC). _ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MissouriQueensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, AustraliaKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This is a revised competitive renewal of a grant to study activation of hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo.During the previous funding period, we used a novel transgenic embryo explant culture system to show thatepithelial-mesenchymal interactions play an important role in yolk sac hematopoiesis and vasculardevelopment in the mouse. Diffusible signals from visceral endoderm mediate these interactions and canreprogram hematopoiesis in a tissue (anterior epiblast) that is not fated to form blood cells. We identified twohematopoietic-inducing VE signals, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-2, andfound that they upregulate Bmp4 in explant culture. In the frog, the paired-type homeodomain transcriptionfactor XMix.1 is induced by BMP4. Its ectopic expression in whole embryos transforms dorsal mesoderm toa ventral fate, resulting in formation of large numbers of blood cells. We cloned a mouse relative (mMix orMixl) of the Xenopus and zebrafish Mix/Bix gene family and have generated a number of unique geneticmodels for analysis of its function during development. The single mouse Mix gene is expressed in theposterior VE prior to gastrulation and later in the primitive streak and nascent mesoderm in the gastrulatingembryo. Although previous studies in the mouse embryo have pointed to a critical role for mMix ingastrulation, its function in the development of mesodermal derivatives remains unclear. Hematopoieticdefects have been identified in differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells in which mMix was geneticallyinactivated. We have recently discovered that conditional induction of mMix in ES cell-derived embryoidbodies results in acceleration of the mesodermal developmental program. A major finding to emerge fromthis work is that increased numbers of mesodermal, hemangioblastic, and hematopoietic progenitors form inresponse to premature activation of mMix. We hypothesize that mouse MX functions early in the recruitmentand/or expansion of mesodermal progenitors to the hemangioblastic and hematopoietic lineages. In thisapplication, we will: (1) identify the critical points in the mesoderm developmental program when mMix canregulate formation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; (2) assess the developmental potentials of mMix-expressing cells and better define the surface antigens of the mesodermal progenitors for the hematopoieticlineage; (3) examine the consequences of deleting mMix function in mesodermal progenitors for thehematopoietic lineage in vivo. Characterization of mesodermal stem/progenitor cell populations andelucidation of the common as well as the distinguishing features of embryonic versus adult hematopoieticand vascular development will be of fundamental importance and may also advance our ability to modulatethe self-renewal/differentiationof stem cells for therapeutic purposes.K.mPERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NYPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): BARON, Margaret H.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Specific mechanisms of how the reactive microenvironment affects prostate cancer progression areunknown. Previous studies from our group have shown that the reactive microenvironment has propertiesand gene expression similar to wound repair biology. These include changes in stromal cell phenotype,altered neurogenesis and the involvement of specific T regulatory cells. We have also shown that reactivestroma is tumor promoting. These studies have shown that carcinoma cells and nerves exhibit reciprocalinteractions leading to elevated carcinoma proliferation and induced neurogenesis. In addition, theinvolvement of gamma-sigma T regulatory cells may play an important role in tumor progression. The concurrentrecruitment of myofibroblasts to PIN and carcinoma foci implicates a coordinated host response in thesebiologies that promotes tumorigenesis. Importantly, our group has shown that specific biomarkers of thisreactive microenvironment are predictive of recurrence of human prostate cancer. The integrated biologiesof this response and specific mechanisms are not yet understood at a level where more effective prognosticsor novel therapeutics can be developed. Accordingly, the overall objectives of this project are to understandhow reactive stroma, neurogenesis, and immunity responses in prostate cancer microenvironment functionand interact mechanistically during the initiation and progression of early, organ confined disease. Theendpoint of this study is to understand the key components, regulators, and mechanisms with a specificfocus on early prostate cancer. We have assembled a team of experts who will focus their efforts onunderstanding three interrelated biologies in the tumor microenvironment. We propose a Programcomposed of an Expression Analysis and Pathology Core and three interrelated Projects. Project 1 willaddress the co-evolution, origin, and specific regulators of reactive stromal cells. Project .2 will address therole of axonogenesis and neurogenesis in regulating early cancer. Project 3 will focus on the role of gamma-sigma Tregulatory cells and signaling through Toll-like receptors in prostate cancer progression. Together, theseProjects and Core will provide fundamental data regarding the temporal and spatial composition, geneexpression profiling, and potential regulators of the microenvironment in human tissues and mouse models.This group of Investigators has worked together for several years and has planned these studies aroundtheir pre-established collaborations. The overall goal of this Program is to provide novel pre-clinical data,from which more effective biomarkers and therapeutics can be developed that target the microenvironmentof early prostate cancer.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Baylor College of MedicineHouston TexasPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Rowley, David R., Ph.D.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "We propose to form the Northeastern Ohio Animal Imaging Resource Center (NOAIRC) to provide the many regionalcancer researchers with state-of-the-art small animal, molecular and cellular imaging facilities and expertise. Systems willinclude a combined micro- x-ray computed tomography/SPECT system, a clinical SPECT system with pin-hole collimators,a high resolution micro-PET system, and 7T and g.4T small animal MR imaging and spectroscopy systems. All are alreadyon-site or ordered from recent grant awards and institutional sources. With an SAIRP award, we will acquire a biotumines- cence/fluorescence imaging system to facilitate reporter gene methods and new opportunities in novel agents (e.g., quan-tum dots). We will also create small animal optical coherence tomography with color Doppler and microscopic OCT to promote in vivo spectroscopic methods and high spatial and temporal analysis of structure and function (e.g., perfusion). Interdisciplinary backing for this project is unprecedented with financial and other commitments from three schools of Case Western Reserve University (Medicine, Engineering, Arts & Sciences), the University Hospitals of Cleveland, the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the State of Ohio. In addition to core resources via nuclear imaging, MR imag- ing and spectroscopy, bioluminescence/fluorescence, and OCT, the NOAIRC will also provide an integrated environment with core facilities in quantitative image analysis and visualization, animal welfare/experiment preparation and novel imag- ing agents like functionalized liposomes or CEST agents. This latter core integrates with our radionuclide imaging capabili- ties, our ongoing biomolecular and nanoscale engineering for targeted therapeutics initiative, ongoing research in reporter genes, and a P20 In-vivo and molecular Imaging Center planning grant to add strategic strength in molecular imaging. Allof these will be within a single facility to promote cross-collaboration and interdisciplinary research, This proposal brings together researchers in imaging with the many regional scientists who are studying cancer biology via small animal models and rapidly gaining an appreciation of the power of in vivo imaging. We aim to advance small animal imaging technology by developing new image acquisition and analysis methods, new methods in reporter genes and functionalized agents, and pharmacokinetic modeling. We will apply developments to experiments in cancer biology and therapy. Animal welfare/preparation research will focus on analysis of physiologic effects of anesthesia and develop- ing new formulations that maintain the physiology to be measured, while providing state-of-the-art methods for blood sam- pling and monitoring. The NOAIRC will include a strong educational focus to create a long-range impact. It will invigorate strong Ph.D. programs in imaging already at Case. It will strengthen educational programs for basic and clinical scientistsin cancer via integration with existing T32 and K12 grants and promote new horizons via K25 proposals. The result will be clinicians, scientists, and engineers trained for the next generation of conventional and molecular imaging techniques. PERFORMANCESITE(S) (organization,city,state) 1.

External Advisory Committee for Research Education and TrainingWe have constituted an External Advisory Committee, whose members have agreed to meet in Dallas onceyearly. The Committee is chaired by David DeMets PhD,Professor and Chair of the Department ofBiostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin. Other members will include (1) RobertCaliff MD, Director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute at Duke University (and now overall PI of theirCTSA); (2) Harlan Krumholz MD, Professor of Medicine at Yale University; (3) Richard Whitley MD, Professorof Pediatrics at the University of Alabama; and (4) Robert Temple, Associate Director of the Office of MedicalPolicy and former Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation and Research I at the US FDA.C4d. Independent Evaluation of Trainee and Scholar Progress / AccomplishmentsAs described in detail under  Scientific Review and Evaluation , the Research Career Milestones Committeewill be responsible for independently evaluating the scientific and professional progress of both the T32 andK12 scholars, who are pursuing a Master's degree in Clinical Science at the UT Southwestern GraduateSchool of Biomedical Sciences. As a result, they will function as a Thesis Committee for the Program.C4e. Research Education OmbudsmanByron Cryer MD, Assistant Dean for Minority Development, will function as the Research EducationOmbudsman. He will provide unbiased advice and guidance to both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees andscholars; will help them select among program options; and will investigate and resolve complaints, concernsand disputes that might occur involving trainees or mentors. In addition, he will encourage those participatingin less intense training options to subsequently participate in more intense training options; when this occurs,trainees will be able to transfer credits for earlier courses and experiences.C5. Description of Proposed ProgramC5a. Enhancing Research Educational ProgramsSbecific Airr addinasnewlMurseslto]tou nldiC5a(1). Expansion of the Didactic CurriculumCurrently we offer 28 full-semester courses in research principles and methods through the UT SouthwesternGraduate School of Biomedical Sciences (see Table C1 at end of this section). With the advent of theNCTCTSI, we will develop and offer 10 new full-semester courses (each 16-48contact hours) to enhancetraining in methodologies and technologies that are important to current efforts to enhance translationalresearch, both from the bench to the bedside and from the clinic to the community. We have already identifieda course director for each new offering, and he/she has already developed a synopsis of each planned course:Principles and Practice of Community-Based Participatory Research (Mark DeHaven, PhD). Understandinginteraction of clinical research, public health & social science; engaging community leaders and organizations;designing practice-based studies; developing models of effective care to be tested in trials. ¿PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 343 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director!

Support andExpansion of the Socratic CurriculumA key ingredient in our current approach to training is immersion in a Socratic Curriculum that takes placealong side of the didactic curriculum. The Socratic curriculum consists of a rich assembly of seminars andworkshops  conducted using a highly interactive Socratic approach  which provide daily opportunities fortrainees and scholars to apply what they have learned in their courses, exchange ideas and develop functionalteams in the process of presenting, defending and evaluating their own work and the work of their peers andother trainees under conditions that mimic real-life peer-review. In our experience, the didactic curriculum maymake trainees knowledgeable, but the Socratic Curriculum allows them to develop a mastery of the criticalprinciples of clinical research. In the Socratic Curriculum, each trainee is challenged to venture opinions,provide critiques and commit errors, all in full view of their mentors, peers and program directors.The Socratic Curriculum also provides many other additional benefits:¿ The Socratic Curriculum allows senior trainees and scholars the opportunity to teach junior trainees andscholars  an interaction that might take place only intermittently if each year's class simply confined theirattention to their own work. This allows senior trainees and scholars to begin to develop mentoring skills.¿ The Socratic Curriculum allows trainees and scholars to expand their interaction with mentors. Sincementors are required to actively participate in the Socratic (but not didactic) curriculum, a presentation by atrainees or scholar at a conference opens him/her to feedback from outside mentors.¿ The Socratic Curriculum is an important means of promoting multidisciplinarv team building. For example,during their second year, some trainees and scholars will attend a real FDA Advisory Committee meeting inRockville MD. Following their return to Texas, they will review the literature on the efficacy or safety of atherapeutic intervention (not the one covered at the meeting), and divide themselves into two teams: one teamwill assume the role of the pharmaceutical company and present the evidence in a favor or a drug's approvaland the other team will assume the role of FDA review panel and critique the evidence presented. The debatePHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04. Reissued 4/2006) Page 344 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director: Packer. Miltonbetween the two teams will be played out in full view of all interested individuals as part of the SocraticCurriculum. All key roles in the workshop will be played by the trainees and scholars working asteams.¿ The Socratic Curriculum will provide senior trainees and scholars the opportunity .to build an institutionalidentity as an expert in matters related to clinical research. The performance of trainees and scholars in theopen forum provided by the Socratic Curriculum will encourage other young emerging investigators to look tothem for consultation and collaboration. The net effect of all of these interactions will be to create a meaningful,level of institutional recognition for the trainees and scholars.We have developed a collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration to provide publicly availablematerials for educational purposes; several of its medical officers will participate in our Socratic Curriculum.The NCTCTSI Principal Investigator (Dr.Milton Packer) previously served as a member and/or Chair of anFDA Advisory Committees for 16 years and continues as an FDA consultant. Dr. Robert Temple (Director ofMedical Policy at FDA) currently serves on our Roadmap K12 External Advisory Committee.Currently, our Socratic Curriculum offers 14 ongoing regularly scheduled seminars, workshops andconferences (see Table C2 at end of this section). With the advent of the NCTCTSI, we will develop 6 newongoing regularly scheduled conferences to enhance training in methodologies and technologies that areimportant to translational research, both from the bench to the bedside and from the clinic to the community.Translational Science Forum. Weekly conference to provide an opportunity for young PhD basic ortranslational scientists to present a research idea based on a laboratory finding or novel researchmethodologywith the intent of facilitating translation into the clinic. Audience will consist of clinical or translationalinvestigators, who will identify and attempt to overcome obstacles to translation.Methodological Strategies for Clinical and Translational Research. Weekly presentations by departmentalfaculty describing original research in a methodological discipline. Goal is to enhance awareness of novelmethodologies to facilitate their uptake by other investigators.Technological Opportunities for Clinical and Translational Research. Monthly presentations by scientists withexpertise in translational technologies with the intent of increasing awarenessand optimal utilization of existinglaboratory-based resources.Community Health Research Forum. Twice-monthly presentations by investigators planning, executing oranalyzing community-based participatory research projects. Presentations will summarize experiences, defineuseful strategies and identify real or potential impediments to success. Goal is to build a cadre of researchersand collaborators who can identify and share best practices in this field.Academic Career Development Seminars. 90-minute interactive seminars held every other week to review allaspects of career development in a multidisciplinary academic environment. Topics include (1)communications across academic disciplines; (2) interactions with mentors; (3) developing an extramural grantportfolio; (4) interactions with industry; and (5) strategies for academicadvancement.Mentor Leadership Conferences. Monthly conference required for active mentors. Case studies in settingexpectations; distinguishing coaching from mentoring; stretching Scholars without stressing them; buildingScholar strengths and avoiding mentor clones; leadership and team building; effective interpersonalcommunication: identifying and resolving conflicts; fair and effective evaluation processes; mentoring ethics.C5b. Improving Research Training of Predoctoral StudentsC5b(1). Enhancing the Core Curriculum of Clinical Doctoral Degree ProgramsCurrently, the core curriculum of our schools granting a clinical doctorate degree (medical, dental, pharmacy ornursing schools) provides little opportunity for education in the principles or methods of clinical research. Sucheducation is valuable to all students (even those not contemplating or destined for a clinical research career),since it increases the ability of each student to critically evaluate the clinical research literature and make aninformed judgment about the adoption of new approaches.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued4/2006) Page 345 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director! Packer. MiltonAt UT Southwestern, with the advent of the NCTCTSI, we will address this important need by:¿ Developing a new required course (for all medical students) on clinical research principles and methods,which will emphasize design, biostatistics and ethics and will be given during the second year (25 hours) Thisformal course will incorporate existing informal seminars that focus on statistics and epidemiology. Developing a new required course (for all medical students) on the approach to critically evaluating theresearch literature, which will utilize multiple small-group interactive discussions and will be given during thefourth year (30 hours). Offering a general clinical research elective (a one-month on-hands practicum experience), which willinclude a rotation in the GCRC (now renamed the Clinical and Translational Research Center). During thisrotation, students will make daily rounds on each patient in the CIRC, become familiar with the researchquestions and protocols, and participate actively in the collection and review of research data under theguidance of the investigators and other members of the research team. Offering specific clinical research electives, which will provide exposure to a specific research area underthe mentorship of a specific clinical or translational investigator.UT Southwestern has already implemented the first and fourth elements of the plan, and the Baylor College ofDentistry is currently considering a similar approach.C5b(2). ^Creating a New Translational Science Track for PhD Candidates in the Basic SciencesAs noted throughout this application, there is a widening divide between basic biology and medicine, becausemost basic scientists in medical schools are not trained in human biology, while most physicians have difficultyharnessing the explosion of new knowledge into their research programs. Although those with both an M.D.and Ph.D. degree can potentially bridge the gap, it is difficult to increase the number of MSTP trainees,because few students are willing to commit to the prolonged period of training. A recent National ResearchCouncil report concluded that there is a critical need to train a new cadre of Ph.D. investigators who canidentify clinically relevant biological problems and have the skill set to push the translation of new knowledgeinto tools that improve human health.With the advent of the NCTCTSI, UT Southwestern will create a new Translational Science Track that bridgeseducation in basic science, medicine and clinical research principles and practices. This track will train a newcadre of scientists who are capable of formulating clinically relevant questions from a basic scienceperspective; integrating basic and clinical research; and facilitating the bidirectional transfer of knowledge, Atfirst, we anticipate that 6-10 students will be admitted per year, and the number will grow as the programmatures and prospers. [UT Southwestern currently has > 500 graduate students, 30% minority.] Graduatesofthis program will lead their own research programs in basic and/or clinical departments, while others will workin partnership with physicians in team-based research or in the pharmaceutical / biotechnology industry. Thecosts of the program will be borne through institutional resources.The Translation Science Track will havethe following characteristics:¿ The Track will build on the current core curriculum for PhD candidates in the Graduate School forBiomedical Sciences at UTSouthwestern.¿ The Track will include new courses that focus on human physiology, human pathophysiology, medicalbiochemistry and translational pharmacology. These courses will consist of a mix of didactic and self-learningelements, with an emphasis on problem solving and will be taken in the first 2years.¿ The Track will include existing elements of didactic and Socratic curriculum, particularly those elementsthat focus on clinical research principles and methods, ethics and regulatory training, career development andteam building, and translational opportunities and interactions.¿ The Track will include a mentored clinical experience, which will consist of rotations in the GCRC (nowrenamed the Clinical and Translational Research Center). The PhD candidates will make daily rounds on eachpatient in the CTRC with their clinical mentor; become familiar with the research questions and protocols; andparticipate in the collection of research data under the guidance of the investigators and other members of theresearch team. These clinical experiences will help Ph.D. students gain a feeling for medical science and itsculture, and they will increase interactions between graduate students and their clinical counterparts to begin alifelong dialogue that is essential for the bidirectional flow of information and for team-based clinical research.PHS 398/2590(Rev.09/04, Reissued4/2006) Page 346 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director: Packer. Milton¿ The thesis research will focus on translational biology and molecular medicine and may include (1) basicscience studies that define the mechanism of disease pathogenesis and therapeutics in humans; (2)nonhuman and nonclinical research conducted with the intent of understanding principles for the discovery ofnovel therapeutic strategies; (3) clinical investigation that provide an understanding of disease progression anddevelopment of improved treatments; and (4) drug development or identification of new biomarkers. Students in the new Track will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team that will include both basicscientists and physician scientists who actively treat patients and carry out basic research on the biology ofhuman diseases.Although the development of this new Translational Science Track will initially occur at UT Southwestern, otherNCTCTSI participating institutions are considering similar initiatives.C5b(3). Expanding Short-Term Predoctoral Training ProgramsTen-Week Summer Predoctoral Research Education and Training ProgramThis program currently offers medical students an opportunity to become conversant with clinical researchtheory and practice. This short-term program was initiated at UT Southwestern 40 years ago, and there hasbeen no limit to the number of students who can enter the program; 135 medical students (about 20% of theentire medical school class) enrolled last year. A similar program, which currently exists at the Baylor Collegeof Dentistry, enrolled approximately 25% of the class last year. With the advent of the NCTCTSI, we willcontinue both programs, coordinate their efforts and open them up to participation from other disciplinesrepresented among the NCTCTSI participating institutions.The expanded program will be modeled after the one currently in place at UT Southwestern, which offers a 10-week summer course with both practicum and didactic components:(1) Practicum: Prior to the start of the program, potential mentors submit summaries of possible researchprojects that are fully developed, have IRB approval and can be completed by a motivated student with littleprior training during the 10-week rotation. [Last year, 108 mentors submitted projects (approved by Dr.McPhaul) that offered 158 potential research positions.] The students are then matched with specific projectsdepending on their interest on a first come-first serve basis.(2) Didactic. Students attend an hour-long lunchtime seminar each day. The seminars cover key topics inclinical research, e.g., research study design, basic statistics and epidemiology, principles of measurement;clinical research ethics, regulatory issues, and components of a research paper. These seminars also includepresentations by (1) young investigators who describe their own career development, and (2) researchpresentations by T32 scholars.Students enrolled in this short-term clinical research training program are expected to submit their work to bejudged in a competition that selects the 10 best for presentation at the annual Medical Student ResearchForum. Of note, Dr. Joseph Goldstein (Nobel Laureate at UT Southwestern) and Dr. Kern Wildenthal(President of UT Southwestern) were students in the summer research training program and presented at oneof the earliest Forum meetings. Our K12 scholars act asjudges for this competition.We currently maintain follow-up with students who complete the program to encourage them to pursue furtherclinical research training (e.g., T32 or K12 programs).One-Year Predoctoral Research Education and Training ProgramThe goal of this program will be to provide early exposure and concentrated training to facilitate the entry intoclinical research careers of qualified and motivated students enrolled in a professional doctoral degreeprogram. We currently appoint 7-8 one-year trainees each year (4 supported by the Doris Duke Foundationand 3-4 through institutional resources; none through the NIH). With the advent of the NCTCTSI. we willexpand this number to 9-10 in order to accommodate predoctoral students in dentistry, pharmacy and nursing.The additional positions will be supported through institutional resources. The exact number will bedetermined by financial resources, the qualifications of the applicants and the need to achieve diversity.Predoctoral students currently enter the one-year program after completing one or more years of the clinicaldoctoral program, generally before beginning their last year. We carry out a national search to identify adiverse group of students with exceptional talent and aptitude towards scholarship and critical thinking and whoare willing to make a full-time (40 hour) commitment for one year. Prior to the start of the program, eachPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 347 ContinuationFormat PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director: Packer. MiltOHtrainee meets with the Predoctoral Program Director to develop an individualized plan for his/her participationin the program. These discussions describe his/her personal objectives; clarify prior training and experiencethat may enhance or minimize the need for specific aspects of the program curriculum or practicumexperience; and identify potential areas of interest that may lead to the identification of mentors. Trainees arethen matched with a mentor, who then meets with the trainee monthly to review progress.The trainees take required courses (listed below); electives may be taken from any of the remaining coursesdescribed in Table C1 at the end of this section. The trainees also participate actively in the SocraticCurriculum to expand their interaction with mentors and to learn from other trainees and scholars. Clinical Research Questions and Methods Biostatistics I Clinical Research Design andAnalysis Epidemiology Clinical Research: From Protocol to Implementation Responsible Conduct of ResearchIn addition, each trainee functions as the lead investigator in a research study that addresses a researchquestion generally identified by his/her mentor. The project may rely on the study of existing data, documents,records or diagnostic or pathological specimens and is approved by the Predoctoral Program Director.Following approval, the scholar carries out the mentored research project during which he/she participatesactively in the development of protocols; the submission of IRB documents; the accrual of patients; theanalysis of data; the preparation of presentations; and the writing of reports and manuscripts. The results aredescribed in a research paper to be authored by the trainee.A Special Certificate in Clinical Science from the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences isconferred following completion of the Program.C5b(4). Creating a New 732-Supported Master's Degree Program (Resulting in a Combined MD-MS, DO-MS, DOS-MS or PhD-MS Degree Programs)We will recruit exceptional students who are enrolled in a professional doctoral degree program (i.e., medicine,dentistry, nursing or pharmacy) who will commit themselves to an intense and sustained 2-year program ofmultidisciplinary training and career development. The goal is to provide early exposure and concentratedtraining to facilitate the entry of qualified and motivated students into clinical research careers. Candidatessuccessfully completing the program will be awarded a Master's degree in Clinical Science.Candidate Eligibility and SelectionThe T32 trainees will enter the program after completing one or more years of a clinical doctoral program,generally before beginning their last year. During the first 3 years of grant period, we will seek out individualsafter they are already in the midst of the MD, DO, DDS or PhD program. However, after we gain experience,we will expand our search to those who are applying to these doctoral programs in the hope of acceptinghighly qualified individuals directly into a combined a MD-MS, DO-MS, DDS, MS or PhD-MS program.Candidates will be US citizens, non-citizen nationals or permanent US residents who (1) have a baccalaureatedegree; (2) are enrolled in doctoral degree programs in medicine, dentistry, nursing or pharmacy; (3) haveshown exceptional talent and aptitude towards critical thinking, as evidenced by a track record of scholarshipand letters of recommendation; (4) have agreed to participate full-time in the program (minimum 40hours/week) for at least 2 years; and (5) have strong support from a high-ranking institutional official, asevidenced by his/her agreement to allow the student to depart from the usual schedule of doctoral degreecommitments. Individuals who have prior short-term clinical research training or experiences will beencouraged to apply. However, individuals are not eligible if they are not concurrently pursuing a clinicaldoctoral degree or if they are supported by other Federal funds.We plan to appoint 4 new T32 trainees each year (2 to be supported by the NIH and 2 to be supported byinstitutional resources). As noted above, the participating schools have a substantial internal pool of qualifiedapplicants to provide highly competitive candidates for the T32 program, but we will encourage applicants fromnonparticipating schools to enhance the depth and diversity of the trainees. The following qualities will begiven equal weight in the selection process: (1) evidence of a strong commitment to scholarship and criticalthinking; (2) prior experience that increasing the likelihood of contributing meaningfully to multidisciplinarysettings; (3) strength of interest in a career as a clinical scientist; (4) strength of support from sponsoringdepartment and/or institution; and (5) contribution to the diversity of the trainee's peer group.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 348 Continuation Format Page; Principal Investigator/ProgramDirector! Packer. MiltonTailoring a Training Plan to Individual Needs ¿Following acceptance, each trainee will meet with Dr. McPhaul, the Predoctoral Program Director, to developan individualized plan for his/her participation in the program. These discussions will (1) describe his/herpersonal objectives; (2) clarify prior training and experience that may enhance or minimize the need for specificaspects of the program curriculum or practicum experience; and (3) recognize potential areas of interest thatmay lead to the identification of potential mentors. The intent is to develop a Formal Training Plan, which willdescribe specific didactic course requirements, a commitment to participate in the Socratic Curriculum, and adescription of the research practicum to be completed by the trainee. The plan will describe a full-timecommitment that will be at least 2 but not more than 3 years in duration. The duration of involvement must becontinuous and represent a full-time effort (40 hours/week) for at least 10 months a year.MentoringDuring the first 3 months of the program, each student will matched to a personal mentoring committee, whichwill consist of: (1) A primary senior clinical investigator with expertise in the trainee's primary area of interest.(2) A secondary mentor with expertise in a complementary field of study (e.g., basic science), which might beexpected to add a mechanistic dimension to the trainee's work; and (3) a second or thirdyear K12 scholar (toprovide them with mentoring experience). The selection of mentors will be approved by the Education andTraining Advisory Committee. The trainee will meet with his/her lead mentor monthly, with his/her secondarymentors less frequently, and with the entire personal mentoring committee every six months. It is expectedthat each trainee will maintain the same mentors for the duration of his/her participation. In addition to theseindividual mentors, the T32 trainees will receive additional mentoring from more senior T32 trainees, from T32program graduates, from the Thesis Committee and from active K12 scholars. To facilitate the latterinteraction, the T32 trainees and K12 scholars will share space in the same suite of offices.Didactic and Socratic CurriculumThe trainees will take required and elective courses, primarily in the first year, but also during the second year.The required courses are listed below, whereas electives may be taken from any of the remaining coursesdescribed in the Table C1 at the end of this section.Clinical Research Questions and Methods Biostatistics IClinical Research Design andAnalysis Biostatistical ApplicationsIClinical Research Protocol Development Epidemiology IResponsible Conduct of Research Effective Data Collection and ManagementClinical Research: From Proposal to Implementation Clinical Research Management & Leadership Genetic and Molecular Science for the Clinical InvestigatorThe T32 trainees will also participate actively in the Socratic Curriculum to expand their interaction withmentors, to learn from other trainees and scholars, and to practice multidisciplinary team building.Research PracticumFirst Year. The research practicum will begin during the first year, when the trainees meet with their mentorsto identify potential areas of research interest. The trainee will carry out a thorough review of the literaturepertinent to this focused area, critically analyze the evidence, and identify specific questions to beprospectively addressed in future research. The findings of the literature review will be discussed with his/hermentors, presented at a conference of the trainee's peers and summarized in an analytical manuscript.In addition, by the end of the first year, the trainee will submit a plan for his/her mentored research project.This plan will describe the trainee's involvement as the lead investigator in a study that must involve theprospective collection of data and thus may not rely primarily on existing data. The Predoctoral ProgramDirector and the Education and Training Advisory Committee will review the proposal to ensure that the traineewill be the lead investigator and that the research project(s) will be hypothesis-driven and likely to lead tointerpretable data.Second Year.

Morethan 80% of the MSTP alumni become active researchers in leading institutions. The combined MD/PhDprogram typically lasts 7-8 years. The current medical school class includes 20 MD/PhD students,approximately 17% of the class. As of September 1, 2006, MSTP students numbered 182 with 78 in the MDphase of training. Medical students seeking to transfer into the MSTP can significantly enhance their researchbackground by participating in the T35 Short-term Research Program or the year-long MA/MD program.D.4 T32 Predoctoral Interdisciplinary Clinical Research Training Program (PI: Jay Piccirillo, MD): Theaims of the T32 are to promote clinical and translational research training among predoctoral health carestudents and create an efficient entry into clinical and translational research careers. The T32 has two tracks: ashort-term (summer) and an intensive (1-year) research track. The T32 is targeted to predoctoral medical,pharmacy, nursing, physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), social work and biomedical engineeringstudents at WU and other schools in the region. The T32 has 5 cores: Curriculum (Director Brian Gage, MD),Short-Term Practical Research Experience (Director Ellen Binder, MD), Intensive Training (Director MichaelDeBaun, MD, MPH), and Faculty and Administrative (Director Jay Piccirillo, MD). The Administrative Coreincludes Drs Piccirillo, Gage, DeBaun, Jeffe, and Julie Follman (administrator). The Administrative Core isresponsible for recruiting, selecting, placing, monitoring, evaluating and tracking trainees. There is also aProgram Committee, Admission Committee and an Advisory Committee, which include representation fromdiverse disciplines and departments. An External Advisory Board has been established with distinguishedinvestigators from outside WU who visit to review the program and make recommendations for improvement.D.4.a Short-Term (Summer) Research Track involves 2 months of mentored practical clinical or translationalresearch experience and introductory classes in research methods. Trainees complete an independentresearch project and are exposed to many phases of clinical and translational research (design,implementation, data analysis, etc.). Courses include: Analysis of Clinical Data and Designing ClinicalResearch. Trainees prepare a 2-page report, present a poster at the Fall Research Rounds (a school-widefunction for all medical students engaged in summer research), and attend an annual, half-day medical center-wide Symposium. Trainees are encouraged to continue their research training in the intensive research track.Analysis of Clinical Data is a 10-hour course with 5 modules that teach biostatistical analysis using clinicalexamples. The 3 main components of each module include a published manuscript, a dataset and a series ofquestions. Students critique the manuscript using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) techniques. They analyzePHS 398/2590 (Rev.09/04,Reissued4/2006) Page 623 ' Continuation Format Page Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Polonsky, Kenneth S. Research Education, Training and Career Developmentthe original dataset as an SPSS file and answerquestions using the dataset. This course is being adapted to aWeb-based environment.Designing Clinical Research is based on the Designing Clinical Research course developed by Stephen Hulleyand colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco and uses the textbook, Designing ClinicalResearch, 2nd Edition (Hulley et al, Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2001). The course is taught in7 2-hoursessions. Topics include: the anatomy and physiology of clinical research; conceiving research questions;choosing subjects: specification, sampling & recruitment; planning measurements: precision andaccuracy;hypotheses & underlying principles; estimating sample size and power; designing anobservational study -cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies; enhancing causal inference in observational studies;designing experiments - clinical trials; designing diagnostic andprognostic test studies; secondary dataanalysis; designing questionnaires and data collection instruments; implementing studies; data management;and writing andfunding research protocols.D.4.b Intensive Research Track Course requirements are Analysis of Clinical Data; Designing Outcomesand Clinical Research, Ethicaland LegalIssues in Clinical Research, and Scientific Writing (seeK30summary); and Markey Pathobiology of Human Disease States. Participants attend a weekly researchseminar, including journal club and research-in-progress discussion, attend the weekly seminar series, attendan annual, half-day medical center-wide research symposium, present their research to an advisorycommittee, and submit a manuscript to a medical journal. Graduates of the program can apply the majority oftheir coursework toward the MSCI degree. Medical students are also eligible for ajoint MA/MDdegree.Markey Pathobiology of Human Disease is a translational research course focused on human diseases. Thecourse is presented at an intermediate/advanced graduate level. Course faculty include clinical, translationaland basic scientists. Course materialfor each disease is presented in 10,1.5-hour sessions typically includinga 60-minute faculty presentation and a 30-minute discussion of papers from the historical and current scientificliterature. Disease topics in the course serve as paradigmsfor students to consider how basic, translationaland clinical research impact human disease. An appropriate disease topic fulfills the following criteria: 1) thedisease represents an important public health issue, 2) there must be a reasonably detailed scientificunderstanding of basic disease mechanisms, and 3) there must be a rather wide gap between what is knownat a fundamental level and what is possible in terms of prevention or treatment. Examples include sickle cellanemia, malaria, diabetes, cysticfibrosis, AIDS, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupuserythematosis, Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, chronic leukemia, asthma, and pre-eclampsia.D.4.C Seminars, Conferences, Journal Club, and RetreatsClinical and Translational Research Seminar: This institution-wide weekly seminar is part of the K30andK12 initiative. This seminar allows K30 and K12 Scholars to present and critically discuss research ideas andprojects at various points in their evolution. The T32 trainees benefit from listening to the topics presented andhearing the discussions, although they do not give presentations themselves (see K12).T32 Interdisciplinary Research Conference: Faculty from different programs engaged in biomedical researchare invited to the monthly T32 Research Conference. Faculty describe the benefits and challenges ofcollaborative research. They discuss administrative, professional, and interpersonal techniques that areeffective at breaking down barriers and fostering collaboration. The goals of this conference are to expose T32trainees to investigators conducting interdisciplinary research and to prepare predoctoral students to conductresearch in team settings. This conference is mandatoryfor all T32 trainees. Doris Duke fellows, otherpredoctoral trainees and other interested membersof the WU community are encouraged to attend.T32 Journal Club. Research-in-Proqress. and Book Club: T32 and Doris Duke trainees attend a weeklyjournal club and research-in-progress discussion. The goals are to highlight methodological issues germane toresearch, refine critical appraisal skills, discuss topics of special interest, including protection of humansubjects, placebo effect, and ethical components of clinical research. Trainees select an appropriate article,prepare a written handout and lead the discussion. T32 directors serve as resources to help with thediscussion and help identify interesting articles. Roughly half the sessions are journal club and half areresearch-in-progress discussions Approximately4 research-in-progress sessions are reserved forpresentations by highly successful clinical or translational investigators. .Clinical and Translational Research Training Symposia: A half-day Symposium for T32, Doris Duke, K30 andK12 trainees occurs annually. All trainees present their researchas posters and a number of research projectsare selected for oral presentation. This symposium facilitates ongoing interaction among the clinical andPHS 398/2590(Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 624 Continuation Format Page Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Polonsky, Kenneth S.

We also arrange for additional specific presentations ontopics to facilitate careerdevelopment. Topics include: identifying sources of funding, managing budgets,managing conflict in the workplace, encouraging collaborative multidisciplinary teams, setting personal andprofessional goals, and giving and getting feedback.D.4.d Mentored Research Experience: Trainees participate in a clinical or translational research project witha mentor for either 2 months (short-term) or a full year. Trainees are required to write a 3-5 page researchpaper, which is graded to document progress, and feedback is be given to the trainees on their posters andresearch paper. Full-year trainees have a 5-person Scientific Advisory Committee. Full-year trainees develop acontract for their career development and many trainees pursue MD/MA or MD/MSCI degrees. Trainees meet3 times a year with their advisory committee. For the first 2 months, trainees also meet with the ProgramDirector at least bimonthly to evaluate progress and facilitate mentoring and training. With the mentors,trainees generate, compile and analyze primary data. Trainees and mentors meet at least weekly. Traineesalso participate in their mentor's divisional or departmental research seminars, journal clubs and clinicalrounds. Trainees present their research at departmental seminars and in the annual research symposia.D.4.e T32 Recruitment and Selection: Each year, the T32 provides funds for 12 students in the short-termresearch experience arid 12 students in the year long program. The distribution of students for both programshas been 50% medical students and 50% pharmacy, nursing, OT, PT, social work, biomedical engineering,and other disciplines. Students are matched with faculty mentors during the recruitment and selection processbased on their interests and joint meetings with the mentors and program directors. Applicants are recruitedfrom WU, SLU, and other medical and professional schools within a 4-5 hour driving radius of St. Louis. Lettersare sent to all students in these programs and presentations are given annually at SLU and other localcolleges. The program is marketed through mailings, brochures, mass e-mail notices, and verbal presentationsat several national medical student meetings, including the Student National Minority Medical Association andthe student branches of the AMA, AMWA and the AAMC deans meetings. WU has 500 medical students andSLU has 600 medical students and there are 100 doctoral students from social work, occupational therapy,physical therapy, and biomedical engineering at WU alone who are eligible for this program. Thus, there is asignificant pool of potential trainees.D.5 K30 Clinical Research Curriculum Award (PI Bradley Evanoff MD, MPH): The aim of the K30 is toprovide high-quality, clinical and translational research training to promote the career development of futureclinical investigators. WU medical students, residents, fellows and faculty are currently eligible. As part of theICTS and with CTSA support, the K30 will be opened to SLU and other academic partners. The K30 programconsists of 3 elements: the Core Curriculum in Clinical Investigation, Mentored Training Program in ClinicalInvestigation, and Master of Science in Clinical Investigation. The K30 Core Curriculum provides afundamental body of knowledge required by clinical investigators, including coursework in research design,epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics and legal issues, team building, leadership, scientific writing, and grantwriting. The K30 Core Curriculum provides key components of the didactic program for K12 and T32 trainees.D.S.a Description of K30 Program Elements:Core Curriculum in Clinical Investigation (CCCI): The 14-credit CCCI provides the basic framework ofknowledge required by an independent clinical researcher. Students may take individual courses or completethe entire 6-course curriculum for a certificate of completion.1) Designing Outcomes and Clinical Research (Course Master, DOCResearch: Brian Gage, MD) includes lectures and small-group instruction from faculty in medicine, surgery, otolaryngology, and pediatrics. DOC Research covers the selection of the research question, writing a research protocol, and executing a clinical study. Topics also include subject selection, observational and experimental design, sample size estimation, clinical measurements, questionnaires, quality-of-life measurement, and data management. The course is designed for clinicians who wish to conduct outcomes, epidemiologic, and patient-oriented clinical research. Students receive ongoing feedback as they incorporate research design concepts into their own research proposals. At the end of the course, students are required to submit a research protocol or a manuscript on their research and to pass the exam. Each student gives an oral presentation and presents a paper or grant proposal for discussion and critique by faculty and students.2) Introduction to Statistics for the Health Sciences (Course master Mark Walker PhD) is taught in a user- friendly manner with emphasis on use of SPSS statistical analysis software. Basic statistical methods arePHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 625 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Polonsky, Kenneth S. Research Education, Training and Career Development taught to help researchers execute their own analyses. Methods include generation of descriptive statistics, correlations, t-test, chi-square goodness of fit tests, one-way ANOVA, and simple regression. The course also introduces factorial ANOVA, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and survival analysis. Classes include presentation of statistical concepts underlying specific procedures, discussion of circumstances under which a procedure is and is not appropriate, demonstration of statistical procedures, and interpretation of program output. Homework involves executing statistical procedures covered in class.3) Epidemiology for Clinical Research (Course master Mario Schootman PhD) introduces principles of epidemiology as they apply to clinical research including basic tools used in descriptive and analytical epidemiology, which are crucial for making informed decisions in the care of patients. Critical thinking and scientific/analytic competencies are emphasized. The course focuses on common applications of epidemiologic principles and tools in clinical research, in clinical issues, and in understanding the medical literature which helps enhance critical thinking and scientific/analytic competencies.4) Ethical and Legal Issues in Clinical Research examines the ethical and public policy questions that arise in research with human subjects. After completing this course, students will be able to 1) describe the history of human subjects research and the development of its ethical norms; 2) describe an overviewof the regulatory framework and the oversight mechanisms that govern human subjects research; 3) identify and promote elements of the research environment that encourage research integrity at both the individual and institutional levels; 4) engage in productive and collegia! interactions with investigators, research subjects, mentors and trainees; 5) discuss the normative and other philosophical questions arising in human subjects research; and 6) identify distinguishing features of clinical science as a moral enterprise and of investigators as moral agents (see Program Functions 2.04 and 2.05).5) Intermediate Statistics for the Health Sciences focuses on Coxproportional hazards, generalized linear models, multiple linear models, ANOVA, repeated measures, regression, applied modeling, ROC curves, checking assumptions and regression diagnostics. Students perform analyses with SPSS and build on analytic skills developed in the introductory course. Completion of this course enables investigators to work independently with their own data and run their own analyses. Content includes data sets with applied exercises, interpreting output, lab assignments, and midterm/final exams.6) Scientific and Grant Writing teaches trainees howto write and submit successful grant proposals and manuscripts. Grant topics include how to find the right funding source; conceptualize, write and submit the proposal; and navigate the study section. Manuscript topics include understanding publishing and the editorial board and peer review processes; writing manuscripts, including introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, abstract, and reference sections; submitting manuscripts; responding to editors; and making revisions to resubmit manuscripts. Course content builds on WU seminars Strategies for Successful Grant Proposals and Preparing Biomedical Manuscripts.Mentored Training Program in Clinical Investigation (MTPCI): The MTPCI offers didactic training andmentorship to select postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty who have departmental support to commit themajority of their time to research and research training for at least 2 years. In addition to completing the CoreCurriculum in Clinical Investigation, MTPCI trainees conduct independent research under the tutelage of amentoring committee, which includes a mentor from his/her department, a mentor from the program corefaculty, and a mentor with subject matter expertise related to the trainee's research project. The trainees alsoattend an ongoing seminar series to present and discuss their research as a work-in-progress.Master of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI): MTPCI trainees and trainees from other programs have theoption to earn an MSCI. In addition to completing the core curriculum, they must complete 2 electives, fulfilladditional research credits, and complete a thesis of either a manuscript or grant proposal. Electives includeofferings from the master's degree programs in genetic epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, healthservices, and health administration, as well as offerings from the St. Louis College of Pharmacy and otherprograms at WU, including biomedical engineering and social work. Trainees may also take coursework atSLU School of Public Health. The MSCI requires a total of at least 33 creditsD.6 NIHRoadmap K12 Program (PI, Victoria Fraser, MD):D.G.a Overview of the Existing K12: WU was awarded an NIH Roadmap K12 grant to establish a newMultidisciplinary Clinical Research Training Program for postdoctoralfellows and faculty from diversedisciplines including, all fields of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, public health, social work, biomedicalPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 626 Continuation Format Page Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Polonsky, Kenneth S. Research Education, Training and Career Developmentengineering, psychology, and anthropology. This innovative program was created through a new partnershipbetween WU (schools of Medicine, Social Work, Arts and Sciences; and Biomedical Engineering), SLU(schools of Public Health, Nursing, and Medicine), St. Louis College of Pharmacy, UMSL College of Nursingand SIUE School of Nursing. The K12 provides 2-5 years of didactic coursework leading to an MSCI or anMSPH combined with hands-on mentored research training supported by at least 2 mentors from differentdisciplines. Trainees benefit from extensive research experience under their mentors' guidance. The trainingalso includes participation in a weekly clinical and translational research seminar series and an annualresearch practicum retreat. The K12 is overseen by a Multidisciplinary Advisory Committee (MAC). The MACincludes representatives from all 5 institutions and all disciplines targetedfor K12 training. MAC members arelisted in Table 35. The K12 has an Executive Committee and 4 cores: recruitment and selection, evaluation,curriculum and administration. There has been extensive interaction between the leadership of the K30, T32,and K12 and we began formally Integrating the programs last year as part of our initial CTSA proposal.Research Teams: The K12 is also supported by 9 multidisciplinary research teams. Research teams and teamleaders include: 1) Metabolism, Nutrition and Cardiovascular (Clay Semenkovich, MD, and Samuel Klein, MD);2) Neuroscience (John Morris, MD); 3); Bone Biology (Roberto Civitelli, MD); 4) Cancer (John DiPersio,MDPhD); 5) Infectious Disease (Robert Belshe MD, Victoria Fraser MD); 6) Inflammatory Disease (WilliamStenson, MD); 7) Epidemiology and Prevention (Linda Cottier, PhD); 8) Behavioral Science (Mario Schootman,PhD); and 9) Outcomes and Health Services (Bradley Evanoff, MD, MPH). Representative research teams thatexemplify the breadth of clinical and translational research at WU and SLU are described in Program Function2.02. Members of all the research teams serve as mentors and participate in the didactic curriculum.Mentored Research Practicum: Individual trainee-mentor interactions are a fundamental component of thementored research practicum experience. Trainees initially participate in their mentors' research to learn basicskills and then develop their own research projects. During the research practicum, trainees build upon theircoursework to design and carry out clinical or translational research projects from start to finish. Study design,IRB approval, recruitment, data collection, data analysis and dissemination of results are learned throughhands-on experience with the close supervision of a research mentor. Extensive frequent interactions betweenmentors and trainees helps ensure that trainees learn practical skills from their mentors, receive ongoing socialand professional support to foster their training and career development, and have a successful andexperienced  guide  along their path from trainee to independent clinical or translational investigator. Mentorshelp trainees learn how to develop research questions and hypotheses,formulate study designs to answerquestions, collect and analyze data, disseminate results and write grants. Mentors also foster trainees' careerdevelopment through introductions, networking, recommendations for reviews, book chapters, speakingengagements, committee participation and promotion. Trainees will have extensive support not only from theirindividual mentors but also from the MAC, the Council of NIH-Funded Training Programs, the core curriculumfaculty and the Education Committee, who are significantly invested in the trainees and their welfare. Traineespresent their research in the seminars and receive feedback. Their writing and grant proposals are alsodeveloped and evaluated through didactic coursework. Thus we are  creating a village  to mentor and supporttrainees in addition to their primary research mentors.Research Design Incubator (RDI): K12 scholars are supported by a RDI which includes a biostatistician, datamanager, research coordinators and data entry personnel to help the scholars with study design, studyimplementation, data management and analysis. This RDI will be integrated with CTSA Program Function 2.04(biostatistics) to expand biostatistical support for all trainees.D.6.b Mentor Selection and Training: A representative sample of T32 and K12 mentors, their disciplines andtrack records are given in Tables 36 and 37. Mentors were selected from over 200 clinical, translational orbasic research faculty at WU and SLUfrom multiple departments, divisions and programs. Their studies spanthe spectrum of clinical and translational research (patient-oriented research, genomics, imaging, biomarkers,pathogenesis, clinical trials, epidemiology, behavioral studies, outcomes,and health services research).Mentors for the T32 and K12 were selected based on the following criteria: ¿ Documented success as a clinical or translational investigator : ¿ Current and past independent peer-reviewed funding for their research program ¿ National or international reputation as a clinical or translational investigator ;_PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 627 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): .

Half,dayworkshops for mentors will be developed and provided once a year. Mentors will receive ongoing trainingthrough the CCTRT. Contracts have been developed for mentors in the K12 programs describing expectations,time commitment, and requirement to participate in program development and evaluation. These will be sharedwith mentors in all programs. Mentors will be given tours and orientation to the resources of the CCTRT so thatthey may use these resources as well. Mentors will be formally evaluated twice a year by their trainees and bythe CCTRT programs' evaluation core. Informal evaluations will be ongoing through frequent interactions of thetrainees with the CRT programs' faculty, and administrative and evaluation cores. If there are problems withthe mentors, Program Directors will intervene to facilitate solutions, provide support and arrange for new oradditional mentors if necessary. Mentors with negative evaluations or whose circumstances change such thatthey no longer fulfill the criteria or do not have the time to be a mentor will be removed as mentors.D 6.c K12 and K30 Core Curriculum in Clinical Investigation: The Core Curriculum provides instruction incore topics critical to all clinical investigators. All K12 trainees will complete this common Core Curriculum (orequivalent courses), and will take additional elective courses depending on their specific research interests.The core courses include clinical research design, biostatistics, epidemiology, legal and ethical aspects ofclinical research, and writing grants and scientific publications. These 6 core courses are described in the K30section above (D.5.a)Weekly Seminar SeriesSeminars alternate discussion of work-in-progress with critical reading of current clinical research in order topractice and enhance analysis and communication skills. Each trainee formally presents his or her ownresearch in progress twice per year for feedback by peers and faculty.. In addition to presenting their ownwork in oral and written form for peer and faculty evaluation, trainees formally review the written proposals oftheir peers in a way that emulates the duties of a member of an NIH study section. The K12 and K30 ProgramDirectors lead this weekly seminar, with participation of other core faculty. These weekly intensive small-groupdiscussions of research issues are one of the most valuable aspects of the program, allowing trainees to leamin an active and participatory fashion.K12 Research Practicunri RetreatThe annual retreat provides another venue to facilitate interaction betweenthe K12 trainees, mentors, andresearch teams. K12 trainees present their work followed by discussion with attendees. There are also specificpresentations on career development topics including identifying funding streams, grant writing, managingbudgets, managing conflict, encouraging collaborative teams, gender and racial diversity, successfulpresentations, setting personal and professional goals, and giving and getting performance appraisals.Although the retreat was designed for K12 trainees and to enhance team building across multiple disciplines aspart of the CCTRT, we are opening it to other faculty, fellows and trainees from ICTSMSCI and MPH The curriculum, coursework and requirements for the MSCI and MSPH degree programs are described inthe next section. K12 trainees can pursue a MSCI or a MSPH depending on their prior background, training,research interests and career development goals. The MSCI degree provides didactic and clinical researchtraining relevant to doctoral and post-doctoral trainees working in diverse disciplines. The MSPH programcontains more didactic coursework focused on biostatistics, epidemiology and public health along with a 3-hourinternship.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 628 Continuation Format Page Principal Investigator/ProgramDirector (Last,First, Middle): Polonsky,Kenneth S.

Description of Proposed ProgramC5a. Enhancing Research Educational ProgramsC5a(1). Expansion of the Didactic CurriculumCurrently we offer 28 full-semester courses in research principles and methods through the UT SouthwesternGraduate School of Biomedical Sciences (see Table C1 at end of this section). With the advent of theNCTCTSI, we will develop and offer 10 new full-semester courses (each 16-48 contact hours) to enhancetraining in methodologies and technologies that are important to current efforts to enhance translationalresearch, both from the bench to the bedside and from the clinic to the community. We have already identifieda course director for each new offering, and he/she has already developed a synopsis of each planned course:Principles and Practice of Community-Based Participatory Research (Mark DeHaven, PhD). Understandinginteraction of clinical research, public health & social science; engaging community leaders and organizations;designing practice-based studies; developing models of effective care to be tested in trials.PHS 398/2590(Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 343 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director!

Types and structures of databases; definingterms & categories; approaches to data quality and missingness; identifying appropriate questions; minimizingrisk of false positive results due to multiplicity of comparisons; seeking replication across databases.C5a(2). Support and Expansion of the Socratic CurriculumA key ingredient in our current approach to training is immersion in a Socratic Curriculum that takes placealong side of the didactic curriculum. The Socratic curriculum consists of a rich assembly of seminars andworkshops  conducted using a highly interactive Socratic approach  which provide daily opportunities fortrainees and scholars to apply what they have learned in their courses, exchange ideas and develop functionalteams in the process of presenting, defending and evaluating their own work and the work of their peers andother trainees under conditions that mimic real-life peer-review. In our experience, the didactic curriculum maymake trainees knowledgeable, but the Socratic Curriculum allows them to develop a mastery of the criticalprinciples of clinical research. In the Socratic Curriculum, each trainee is challenged to venture opinions,provide critiques and commit errors, all in full view of their mentors, peers and program directors.The Socratic Curriculum also provides many other additional benefits:¿ The Socratic Curriculum allows senior trainees and scholars the opportunity to teach junior trainees andscholars  an interaction that might take place only intermittently if each year's class simply confined theirattention to their own work. This allows senior trainees and scholars to begin to develop mentoring skills.¿ The Socratic Curriculum allows trainees and scholars to expand their interaction with mentors. Sincementors are required to actively participate in the Socratic (butnot didactic) curriculum, a presentation by atrainees or scholar at a conference opens him/her to feedback from outside mentors.¿ The Socratic Curriculum is an important means of promoting multidisciplinarv team building. For example,during their second year, some trainees and scholars will attend a real FDA Advisory Committee meeting inRockville MD. Following their return to Texas, they will review the literature on the efficacy or safety of atherapeutic intervention (not the one covered at the meeting), and divide themselves into two teams: one teamwill assume the role of the pharmaceutical company and present the evidence in a favor or a drug's approvaland the other team will assume the role of FDA review panel and critique the evidence presented. The debatePHS 398/2590(Rev.09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 344 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director: Packer. MlltOPbetween the two teams will be played out in full view of all interested individuals as part of the SocraticCurriculum. All key roles in the workshop will be played by the trainees and scholars working as teams.¿ The Socratic Curriculum will provide senior trainees and scholars the opportunity .to build an institutionalidentity as an expert in matters related to clinical research. The performance of trainees and scholars in theopen forum provided by the Socratic Curriculum will encourage other young emerging investigators to look tothem for consultation and collaboration. The net effect of all of these interactions will be to create a meaningfullevel of institutional recognition for the trainees and scholars.We have developed a collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration to provide publicly availablematerials for educational purposes; several of its medical officers will participate in our Socratic Curriculum.The NCTCTSI Principal Investigator (Dr. Milton Packer) previously served as a member and/or Chair of anFDA Advisory Committees for 16 years and continues as an FDA consultant. Dr. Robert Temple (Director ofMedical Policy at FDA) currently serves on our Roadmap K12 External Advisory Committee.Currently, our Socratic Curriculum offers 14 ongoing regularly scheduled seminars, workshops andconferences (see Table C2 at end of this section). With the advent of the NCTCTSI, we will develop 6 newongoing .regularly scheduled conferences to enhance training in methodologies and technologies that areimportant to translational research, both from the bench to the bedside and from the clinic to the community.Translational Science Forum. Weekly conference to provide an opportunity for young PhD basic ortranslational scientists to present a research idea based on a laboratory finding or novel research methodologywith the intent of facilitating translation into the clinic. Audience will consist of clinical or translationalinvestigators, who will identify and attempt to overcome obstacles to translation.Methodological Strategies for Clinical and Translational Research. Weekly presentations by departmentalfaculty describing original research in a methodological discipline. Goal is to enhance awareness of novelmethodologies to facilitate their uptake by other investigators.Technological Opportunities for Clinical and Translational Research. Monthly presentations by scientists withexpertise in translational technologies with the intent of increasing awareness and optimal utilization of existinglaboratory-based resources.Community Health Research Forum. Twice-monthly presentations by investigators planning, executing oranalyzing community-based participatory research projects. Presentations will summarize experiences, defineuseful strategies and identify real or potential impediments to success. Goal is to build a cadre of researchersand collaborators who can identify and share best practices in this field.Academic Career Development Seminars. 90-minute interactive seminars held every other week to review allaspects of career development in a multidisciplinary academic environment. Topics include (1)communications across academic disciplines; (2) interactions with mentors; (3) developing an extramural grantportfolio; (4) interactions with industry; and (5) strategies for academic advancement.Mentor Leadership Conferences. Monthly conference required for active mentors. Case studies in settingexpectations; distinguishing coaching from mentoring; stretching Scholars without stressing them; building Scholar strengths and avoiding mentor clones; leadership and team building; effective interpersonalcommunication; identifying and resolving conflicts; fair and effective evaluation processes; mentoring ethics. ,C5b.

Enhancing the Core Curriculum of Clinical Doctoral Degree ProgramsCurrently, the core curriculum of our schools granting a clinical doctorate degree (medical, dental, pharmacy ornursing schools) provides little opportunity for education in the principles or methods of clinical research. Sucheducation is valuable to all students (even those not contemplating or destined for a clinical research career),since it increases the ability of each student to critically evaluate the clinical research literature and make aninformed judgment about the adoption of new approaches.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 345 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director! Packer. MiltonAt UT Southwestern, with the advent of the NCTCTSI, we will address this important need by:¿ Developing a new required course (for all medical students) on clinical research principles and methods,which will emphasize design, biostatistics and ethics and will be given during the second year (25 hours) Thisformal course will incorporate existing informal seminars that focus on statistics and epidemiology. Developing a new required course (for all medical students) on the approach to critically evaluating theresearch literature, which will utilize multiple small-group interactive discussions and will be given during thefourth year (30 hours). Offering a general clinical research elective (a one-month on-hands practicum experience), which willinclude a rotation in the GCRC (now renamed the Clinical and Translational Research Center). During thisrotation, students will make daily rounds on each patient in the CIRC, become familiar with the researchquestions and protocols, and participate actively in the collection and review of research data under theguidance of the investigators and other members of the research team. Offering specific clinical research electives, which will provide exposure to a specific research area underthe mentorship of a specific clinical or translational investigator.UT Southwestern has already implemented the first and fourth elements of the plan, and the Baylor College ofDentistry is currently considering a similar approach.C5b(2). Creating a New Translational Science Track for PhDCandidates in the Basic SciencesAs noted throughout this application, there is a widening divide between basic biology and medicine, becausemost basic scientists in medical schools are not trained in human biology, while most physicians have difficultyharnessing the explosion of new knowledge into their research programs. Although those with both an M.D.and Ph.D. degree can potentially bridge the gap, it is difficult to increase the number of MSTP trainees,because few students are willing to commit to the prolonged period of training. A recent National ResearchCouncil report concluded that there is a critical need to train a new cadre of Ph.D. investigators who canidentify clinically relevant biological problems and have the skill set to push the translation of new knowledgeinto tools that improve human health.With the advent of the NCTCTSI, UT Southwestern will create a new Translational Science Track that bridgeseducation in basic science, medicine and clinical research principles and practices. This track will train a newcadre of scientists who are capable of formulating clinically relevant questions from a basic scienceperspective; integrating basic and clinical research; and facilitating the bidirectional transfer of knowledge. Atfirst, we anticipate that 6-10 students will be admitted per year, and the number will grow as the programmatures and prospers. [UT Southwestern currently has > 500 graduate students, 30% minority.] Graduates ofthis program will lead their own research programs in basic and/or clinical departments, while others will workin partnership with physicians in team-based research or in the pharmaceutical / biotechnology industry. Thecosts of the program will be borne through institutionalresources.The Translation Science Track will have the following characteristics: The Track will build on the current core curriculum for PhD candidates in the Graduate School for Biomedical Sciences at UT Southwestern.¿ The Track will include new courses that focus on human physiology, human pathophysiology, medicalbiochemistry and translational pharmacology. These courses will consist of a mix of didactic and self-learning elements, with an emphasis on problem solving and will be taken in the first 2 years.¿ The Track will include existing elements of didactic and Socratic curriculum, particularly those elementsthat focus on clinical research principles and methods, ethics and regulatory training, career development andteam building, and translational opportunities and interactions. The Track will include a mentored clinical experience, which will consist of rotations in the GCRC (now renamed the Clinical and Translational Research Center). The PhD candidates will make daily rounds on each patient in the CTRC with their clinical mentor; become familiar with the research questions and protocols; and participate in the collection of research data under the guidance of the investigators and other members of the research team. These clinical experiences will help Ph.D. students gain a feeling for medical science and its culture, and they will increase interactions between graduate students and their clinical counterparts to begin a lifelong dialogue that is essential for the bidirectional flow of information and for team-based clinical research.PHS 398/2590 (Rev.09/04, Reissued4/2006) Page 346 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director! Packer. Milton¿ The thesis research will focus on translational biology and molecular medicine and may include (1) basicscience studies that define the mechanism of disease pathogenesis and therapeutics in humans; (2)nonhuman and nonclinical research conducted with the intent of understanding principles for the discovery ofnovel therapeutic strategies; (3) clinical investigation that provide an understanding of disease progression anddevelopment of improved treatments; and (4) drug development or identification of new biomarkers.¿ Students in the new Track will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team that will include both basicscientists and physician scientists who actively treat patients and carry out basic research on the biology ofhuman diseases.Although the development of this new Translational Science Track will initially occur at UT Southwestern, otherNCTCTSI participating institutions are considering similar initiatives.C5b(3). Expanding Short-Term Predoctoral Training ProgramsTen-Week Summer Predoctoral Research Education and Training ProgramThis program currently offers medical students an opportunity to become conversant with clinical, researchtheory and practice. This short-term program was initiated at UT Southwestern 40 years ago, and there hasbeen no limit to the number of students who can enter the program; 135 medical students (about 20% of theentire medical school class) enrolled last year. A similar program; which currently exists at the Baylor Collegeof Dentistry, enrolled approximately 25% of the class last year. With the advent of the NCTCTSI, we willcontinue both programs, coordinate their efforts and open them up to participation from other disciplinesrepresented among the NCTCTSI participating institutions.The expanded program will be modeled after the one currently in place at UT Southwestern, which offers a 10-week summer course with both practicum and didactic components:(1) Practicum: Prior to the start of the program, potential mentors submit summaries of possible researchprojects that are fully developed, have IRB approval and can be completed by a motivated student with littleprior training during the 10-week rotation. [Last year, 108 mentors submitted projects (approved by Dr.McPhaul) that offered 158 potential research positions.] The students are then matched with specific projectsdepending on their interest on a first come-first serve basis.(2) Didactic. Students attend an hour-long lunchtime seminar each day. The seminars cover key topics inclinical research, e.g., research study design, basic statistics and epidemiology, principles of measurement;clinical research ethics, regulatory issues; and components of a research paper. These seminars also includepresentations by (1) young investigators who describe their own career development, and (2) researchpresentations by T32 scholars.Students enrolled in this short-term clinical research training program are expected to submit their work to bejudged in a competition that selects the 10 best for presentation at the annual Medical Student ResearchForum. Of note, Dr. Joseph Goldstein (Nobel Laureate at UT Southwestern) and Dr. Kern Wildenthal(President of UT Southwestern) were students in the summer research training program and presented at oneof the earliest Forum meetings. Our K12 scholars act as judges for this competition.We currently maintain follow-up with students who complete the program to encourage them to pursue furtherclinical research training (e.g., T32 or K12 programs).One-Year Predoctoral Research Education and Training ProgramThe goal of this program will be to provide early exposure and concentrated training to facilitate the entry intoclinical research careers of qualified and motivated students enrolled in a professional doctoral degreeprogram. We currently appoint 7-8 one-year trainees each year (4 supported by the Doris Duke Foundationand 3-4 through institutional resources; none through the NIH). With the advent of the NCTCTSI, we willexpand this number to 9-10 in order to accommodate predoctoral students in dentistry, pharmacy and nursing.The additional positions will be supported through institutional resources. The exact number will bedetermined by financial resources, the qualifications of the applicants and the need to achieve diversity.Predoctoral students currently enter the one-year program after completing one or more years of the clinicaldoctoral program, generally before beginning their last year. We carry out a national search to identify adiverse group of students with exceptional talent and aptitude towards scholarship and critical thinking and whoare willing to make a full-time (40 hour) commitment for one year. Prior to the start of the program, eachPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 347 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director! Packer.

These discussions describe his/her personal objectives; clarify prior training and experiencethat may enhance or minimize the need for specific aspects of the program curriculum or practicumexperience; and identify potential areas of interest that may lead to the identification of mentors. Trainees arethen matched with a mentor, who then meets with the trainee monthly to review progress.The trainees take required courses (listed below); electives may be taken from any of the remaining coursesdescribed in Table C1 at the end of this section. The trainees also participate actively in the SocraticCurriculum to expand their interaction with mentors and to learn from other trainees and scholars. Clinical Research Questions and Methods Biostatistics I Clinical Research Design and Analysis Epidemiology Clinical Research: From Protocol to Implementation Responsible Conduct of ResearchIn addition, each trainee functions as the lead investigator in a research study that addresses a researchquestion generally identified by his/her mentor. The project may rely on the study of existing data, documents,records or diagnostic or pathological specimens and is approved by the Predoctoral Program Director.Following approval, the scholar carries out the mentored research project during which he/she participatesactively in the development of protocols; the submission of IRB documents; the accrual of patients; theanalysis of data; the preparation of presentations; and the writing of reports and manuscripts. The results aredescribed in a research paper to be authored by the trainee.A Special Certificate in Clinical Science from the UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences isconferred following completion of the Program.C5b(4). Creating a New 732-Supported Master's Degree Program (Resulting in a Combined MO-MS, DO-MS, DOS-MS or PhD-MS Degree Programs)We will recruit exceptional students who are enrolled in a professional doctoral degree program (i.e., medicine,dentistry, nursing or pharmacy) who will commit themselves to an intense and sustained 2-year program ofmultidisciplinary training and career development. The goal is to provide early exposure and concentratedtraining to facilitate the entry of qualified and motivated students into clinical research careers. Candidatessuccessfully completing the program will be awarded a Master's degree in Clinical Science.Candidate Eligibility and SelectionThe T32 trainees will enter the program after completing one or more years of a clinical doctoral program,generally before beginning their last year. During the first 3 years of grant period, we will seek out individualsafter they are already in the midst of the MD, DO, DDS or PhD program. However, after we gain experience,we will expand our search to those who are applying to these doctoral programs in the hope of acceptinghighly qualified individuals directly into a combined a MD-MS, DO-MS, DDS, MS or PhD-MS program.Candidates will be US citizens, non-citizen nationals or permanent US residents who (1) have a baccalaureatedegree; (2) are enrolled in doctoral degree programs in medicine, dentistry, nursing or pharmacy; (3) haveshown exceptional talent and aptitude towards critical thinking, as evidenced by a track record of scholarshipand letters of recommendation; (4) have agreed to participate full-time in the program (minimum 40hours/week) for at least 2 years; and (5) have strong support from a high-ranking institutional official, asevidenced by his/her agreement to allow the student to depart from the usual schedule of doctoral degreecommitments. Individuals who have prior short-term clinical research training or experiences will beencouraged to apply. However, individuals are not eligible if they are not concurrently pursuing a clinicaldoctoral degree or if they are supported by other Federal funds.We plan to appoint 4 new T32 trainees each year (2 to be supported by the NIH and 2 to be supported byinstitutional resources). As noted above, the participating schools have a substantial internal pool of qualifiedapplicants to provide highly competitive candidates for the T32 program, but we will encourage applicants fromnonparticipating schools to enhance the depth and diversity of.the trainees. The following qualities will begiven equal weight in the selection process: (1) evidence of a strong commitment to scholarship and criticalthinking; (2) prior experience that increasing the likelihood of contributing meaningfully to multidisciplinarysettings; (3) strength of interest in a career as a clinical scientist; (4) strength of support from sponsoringdepartment and/or institution; and (5) contribution to the diversity of the trainee's peer group.PHS 398/2590(Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 348 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director: Packer. MlltOOTailoring a Training Plan to Individual NeedsFollowing acceptance, each trainee will meet with Dr. McPhaul, the Predoctoral Program Director, to developan individualized plan for his/her participation in the program. These discussions will (1) describe his/herpersonal objectives; (2) clarify prior training and experience that may enhance or minimize the need for specificaspects of the program curriculum or practicum experience; and (3) recognize potential areas of interest thatmay lead to the identification of potential mentors. The intent is to develop a Formal Training Plan, which willdescribe specific didactic course requirements, a commitment to participate in the Socratic Curriculum, and adescription of the research practicum to be completed by the trainee. The plan will describe a full-timecommitment that will be at least 2 but not more than 3 years in duration. The duration of involvement must becontinuous and represent a full-time effort (40 hours/week) for at least 10 months a year.MentoringDuring the first 3 months of the program, each student will matched to a personal mentoring committee, whichwill consist of: (1) A primary senior clinical investigator with expertise in the trainee's primary area of interest.(2) A secondary mentor with expertise in a complementary field of study (e.g., basic science), which might beexpected to add a mechanistic dimension to the trainee's work; and (3) a second or third year K12 scholar (toprovide them with mentoring experience). The selection of mentors will be approved by the Education andTraining Advisory Committee. The trainee will meet with his/her lead mentor monthly, with his/her secondarymentors less frequently, and with the entire personal mentoring committee every six months. It is expectedthat each trainee will maintain the same mentors for the duration of his/her participation. In addition to theseindividual mentors, the T32 trainees will receive additional mentoring from more senior T32 trainees, from T32program graduates, from the Thesis Committee and from active K12 scholars. To facilitate the latterinteraction, the T32 trainees and K12 scholars will share space in the same suite of offices.Didactic and Socratic CurriculumThe trainees will take required and elective courses, primarily in the first year, but also during the second year.The required courses are listed below, whereas electives may be taken from any of the remaining coursesdescribed in the Table C1 at the end of this section.Clinical Research Questions and Methods Biostatistics IClinical Research Design and Analysis Biostatistical Applications IClinical Research Protocol Development Epidemiology IResponsible Conduct of Research Effective Data Collection and ManagementClinical Research: From Proposal to Implementation Clinical Research Management & Leadership Genetic and Molecular Science for the Clinical InvestigatorThe T32 trainees will also participate actively in the Socratic Curriculum to expand their interaction withmentors, to learn from other trainees and scholars, and to practice multidisciplinary team building.Research PracticumFirst Year. The research practicum will begin during the first year, when the trainees meet with their mentorsto identify potential areas of research interest. The trainee will carry out a thorough review of the literaturepertinent to this focused area, critically analyze the evidence, and identify specific questions to beprospectively addressed in future research. The findings of the literature review will be discussed with his/hermentors, presented at a conference of the trainee's peers and summarized in an analytical manuscript.In addition, by the end of the first year, the trainee will submit a plan for his/her mentored research project.This plan will describe the trainee's involvement as the lead investigator in a study that must involve theprospective collection of data and thus may not rely primarily on existing data. The Predoctoral ProgramDirector and the Education and Training Advisory Committee will review the proposal to ensure that the traineewill be the lead investigator and that the research project(s) will be hypothesis-driven and likely to lead tointerpretable data.Second Year.

Several lines of evidence strongly implicate the loss of the maternal human Ube3A (hUbe3A) gene in most, if not all, cases of Angelman syndrome. Ube3A encodes the E6-AP ubiqutin E3 ligase whose substrates remain largely unknown. How the loss of UbeSA activity leads to clinical symptoms of Angelman syndrome patients needs further investigation. In the Drosophila genome, the gene CG6190 encodes the Drosophila Ube3A (dUbeSA), a protein highly homologous to hUbeSA at the amino acid level. Therefore, Drosophila offers an excellent model system to dissect the molecular and cellular functions of Ube3A. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that UbeSA is required for the proper formation of neuronal fine structures and for the normal development of neuronal connectivity. The defects in these neurodevelopmental processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of Angelman syndrome. We will generate dUbeSA loss-of-function mutant flies and characterize dUbeSA function in neuronal development. We will also use these mutant flies to identify some evolutionary conserved key substrates of UbeSA ubiquitin ligase that mediate the effects of UbeSA on the brain development and function. These studies will provide important insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this devastating developmental brain disorder and into the potential avenues for therapeutic interventions.

      "(provided by the applicant): The major objective of this topical conference / workshop will be to synergize multidisciplinary research teams and to catalyze the biomedical applications of microelectromechanical systems - the microelectronics, microfabrication and micromachining technologies known collectively as MEMS (and its extension to the nanoscale (NEMS), Lab-on-a-Chip, and micro total analysis systems) - to change the clinical foundations of disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The topical conference - embedded in the 55th AVS International Symposium and Exhibition, 19-24 October 2008, Boston MA - will present accumulating evidence, state-of-the-art methodologies, and innovative designs in the emerging field of 'BioMEMS,' which includes micro- and nanoscale devices or systems fabricated for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. At the end of the topical conference, there will be a half-day workshop that will specifically address prioritized research opportunities and barriers between clinical application and basic research that make it difficult to translate BioMEMS to the clinic - and clinical needs back to the fabrication bench. These barriers are limiting interest in the field and hampering the clinical research enterprise at a time when it could be expanding much faster than it is. The conference/workshop will include both new and experienced investigators, and will combine formal presentations and informal discussions to convey the merits and tremendous excitement of cutting edge advances in chemistry, biology, physics and engineering - as well as materials science, fabrication, electrokinetics, fluidics and electronics at the micro- and nanoscale - that will accelerate the development of BioMEMS to improve the diagnosis, monitoring, control and treatment of biological systems perturbed in human diseases across multiple organ systems. This NIH proposed effort will provide funds for augmenting the participation of young investigators and underrepresented minorities, a timely investment given the many opportunities that might be exploited over the next 20 years. While the principle workshop goal is to provide new insights into how BioMEMS will be more rapidly incorporated into medicine/health applications, there will be attention to potential spin out applications pertinent to other Federal mission oriented agencies including environment (EPA), space medicine (NASA), and chem/bio defense (DOD, DHS). Investments by these other agencies will augment any NIH programs to exploit BioMEMS. PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state) University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Murday, James Project Narrative It is timely to assemble scientific leaders across multiple fields to assess the state-of-art in BioMEMS as it can be applied to a wide variety of medical diagnostics and therapeutics. BioMEMS seeks to develop and exploit the research and technology developments in MEMS/NEMS, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip for medicine/health applications. A topical conference - embedded in the 55th AVS International Symposium and Exhibition, 19-24 October 2008, Boston, MA - will provide a multidisciplinary forum to engage chemists, physicists, engineers, surface scientists, biomaterial interface specialists, and clinical practitioners. Following the topical conference sessions (and related pertinent sessions available through the traditional AVS program), a half-day workshop will identify and prioritize: a) research opportunities for science discovery pertinent to BioMEMS applications, and b) mechanisms to accelerate the translation of those discoveries into technologies for medical care.\n",

The long-term objective and specificaims of this proposal are to classify all ECG documents associated with BARIII patients to identify baselineECG predictors of long-term outcome, and to classify all myocardial infarct/ischemic events associatedwiththe treatment strategies tested over 5 years of follow-up. Myocardial ischemic events will be classifed byserial ECG changes, cardiac enzyme abnormalities, and clinical symptoms. Myocardial infarction is defmedjas Q wave (symptomatic or silent detected during routine follow-up), non Q wave MI, or unstable anginaassociated with or without new ECG changes resulting in hospital admission; Serial ECG change will bedetected using the Novacode, an ECG comparison program used in large scale clinical trials. Cardiacenzyme abnormalities will be classified using WHO criteria. The results of this proposal will allowdetermination of myocardial ischemic event rates in BARI II, a major study secondary endpoint. The ratesof myocardial infarction and myocardial ischemic events leading to hospital admission will be compared inpatients randomized to initial medical therapy or initial coronary revascularization, and to insulin providingdiabetes treatment protocol vs. insulin sensitizing diabetes treatment protocol.

      "Bone mineral is basically calcium phosphate, and both elements (Ca and P) are required for bone acquisition.Typical Ca intakes in the U.S. are lower than current recommendations, and typical P intakes, higher. Thusattention has been focused mainly on increasing Ca intake, by supplementation and food fortification. Thesalt most commonly used for these purposes is calcium carbonate. But while the average P intake tends to beadequate or generous, nevertheless substantial proportions of older women ingest less than 70% of the RDAfor phosphorus on any given day, and hence may be said to be at risk for P deficiency. When these womenare given a combination of anabolic therapy and supplemental Ca (as the carbonate), the added Ca mayuncover and aggravate the latent P deficiency. This is both because Ca binds phosphate in the gut andreduces its absorption (thereby effectively lowering the P intake still further) and because the induced boneanabolism will itself consume phosphorus, as a result of which absorbed phosphorus may not be sufficient tosupport the increase in bone mineral mass made possible by this therapy.To test the possible importance and value of supplementing both of the components of bone mineral insupport of anabolic therapy of osteoporosis, we propose a 1-year randomized trial, comparing, in two groupsof teriparatide-treated postmenopausal osteoporotic women, calcium supplements with and without extraphosphorus (i.e., Ca phosphate vs. Ca carbonate). The principal outcome measure will be change in bonemineral content over the one year of the trial. A secondary outcome is measurement of bone resorptionbiomarkers so as to assess whether the phosphate salt elevates remodeling relative to the carbonate salt.A finding of superiority of the phosphate-containingcost-neutral change in Ca sources and a correspondingosteoporosis prophylaxis as well).PERFORMANCESITE(S) _an_a_n, ci_,s_Creighton University Medical CenterOsteoporosis Research Center601N. 30th StreetOmaha, NE 68131KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human pathogen associated with a variety of cancers, including B celllymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV encodes an oncoprotein called the latentmembrane protein-1 (LMP-1) whose activity is critical for B cell transformation by EBV. Theultimate goal of the proposed research is to explore the molecular and biochemical mechanisms bywhich LMP-1 contributes to EBV's life cycle in vitro and then to apply results to LMP-I's potentialcontribution to EBV's life cycle in vivo as it relates not only to the process of tumorigenesis but to theactivity of EBV in latently infected B cells of healthy individuals. LMP-1 is expressed in infectedprimary B cells, immortalizaed lypmphoblastoid cell lines, and in some tumor cell lines or biopsies.LMP-1 functions as a constitutively-active cell surface receptor and activates positive growth-regulatory signals via its intracellular C-terminal signaling domain and negative growth-regulatorysignals via its transmembrane domain. The studies described in this proposal are designed with thecombined goals of understanding the function of LMP-I's hydrophobic transmembrane domain inthe context of a) the mechanism of LMP-I's constitutive activation of cellular growth-regulatorysignaling and b) signaling resulting in negative growth-regulation. Defining the mechanism of LMP-l's constitutive activation will provide insights into the control of cellular signal transduction andmay be generally applicable to the molecular mechanisms involved in normal B cell growth controland in the aberrant growth of virally and nonvirally induced malignancies. Understanding theprocess of negative growth-regulation by LMP-1 will provide insights into the broad areas of cellcycle regulation and cytokinesis, and may shed light on the contribution of LMP-1 to EBV's life cycle in vivo, in transformed cells and in latently infected cells in healthy seropositive individuals._ERP(JRMANGE S_TP--{S) {organization, city, state)>Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCDB), University of Colorado,BoulderKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The genotypes or phenotypes of geographically representative samples of rhesus macaques, Macacamulatta, of different subspecies of Chinese, Indian and southeast Asian origin will be compared inphylogenetic context (i.e., together with those of six other species of macaques) using approximately 75DNA loci, amplified using the polymerase chain recation (PCR), to genetically characterize these taxaThese genetic differences will be compared among various hierarchical levels (e.g. regional populations,subspecies, countries of origin, species) of macaques to assess their biological significance using genediversity and phylogenetic methods and each taxa will be genetically characterized with specific markeralleles relative to each other. The loci to be studied include neutral (STR) loci widely dispersed over allchromosomes, mt DNA, a Y-chromosome haplotype,and both class I and class II MHC loci which influenceimmune responsiveness. A program to assign samples of unknown provenience to their correct subspecies,geographic region or country of origin, now in use, will be substantially improved using the new populationsamples and genetic data generated by this grant. Services provided to all nonhuman primate breeding facilities by this grant include typing rhesusmacaques using 15 most informative STR loci to establish pedigrees, the use of these data to estimategenetic parameters such as effective population size, inbreeding and average kinship coefficients, genediversity, generate a genetic profile of individual animals, conduct paternity exclusion analysis for estimatingrelative reproductive success of male breeders and specific founding lineages and the use of theaforementioned assignment program and taxa-specific genetic markers identified during the course of thisstudy to identify the country of origin and subspecies of samples of unknown origin.

      "CMV infection of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients is a continuing problem that impacts theoutcome of this very successful therapy. Anti-viral treatment with ganciclovir/foscarnet is the main treatment strategyto prevent CMV disease post-transplant (Tx). Despite significant advances in formulation and delivery of anti-virals,their use complicates and extends the post-Tx recovery period and risk for CMV disease. The period of immunologicincompetence, pre- and post-Tx complicates the timing of administering immunotherapy. Considering these caveats, weare pursuing a novel therapeutic strategy that focuses on priming or enhancing CMV-specifie T cell immunity inhealthy adults and HSCT donors. The approach utilizes pepfide fusions combining CMV-specific CTL andpromiscuous HLA-DR-binding T-help epitopes, whose activity has been demonstrated in transgenic (Tg) HLA A2mouse models. Clinical studies will focus on the safety and immunogerdcity of two candidate peptides manufacturedunder NCI/RAID auspices. Attaining a frequency of 10S/liter CMV-specific CTL in peripheral blood of vaccinerecipients is an important quantitative goal that translates into an eventual post-infusion level of >107/liter CMV-specific CTL in HSCT recipients, a level associated with disease protection. A two-stage Phase 1 trial design isproposed in which 1) the safety of two pepfide vaccines given at 4 time-points with dose escalation will determine theMaximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in healthy CMV-positives and negatives and 2) the safety of both peptides with anovel adjuvant, CpG 7909 DNA will be defined. A secondary objective will be to measure immunologic correlates,especially the frequency of CMV-specific CTL following each booster, continuing for one year. The best peptide andadjuvant combination based on immunogenicity to enhance recall and primary immune responses will be selected forfurther Phase 2 evaluation in HSCT donor-recipient pairs. HSCT donors will receive 3 doses of peptide pre-Tx,followed by a single booster in the recipient, 28d post-Tx. The primary endpoint will be reduction in CMV viremiawithout ganciclovir treatment. The trial is sufficiently powered to detect a 40% decrease in viremia, distinguishablebetween vaccinees and those offered standard of care. A secondary objective is quantitative measurement of CMV-specific cellular immunity in HSCT recipients for one-year post-Tx. In this trial, protection from CMV disease will becompared between recipients receiving vaccine or standard of care. The goal of developing a universal repertoire ofCMV-specific vaccine candidates will be the object of a developmental study of new fusion peptides in Tg mousemodels that cover population subsets other than HLA A2 that would be applicable to a majority of HSCT recipients.

      "PROJECT 2: The emerging fields of genomics and proteomics have led to a better comprehension of thepathophysiology of cancer and the identification of novel signaling pathways. These pathways offer novel'targets' (e.g. Akt, MEK, mTOR and Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) which has led to the development of 'leadmolecules' designed to inhibit the signaling derived from these pathways. However, this poses atremendous challenge for selecting and/or validating these targets and for broad profiling of lead moleculesfor candidate selection. Molecular imaging technologies have the potential to address these scientific andtechnological challenges. The overall goal of Project 2 is to develop strategies wherein activation orinhibition of key pathways in tumor formation as well as in the response of tumors to therapies canbe non-invasive imaged. Since targeted therapies often lead to tumor cytostasis (Gl arrest), we will in Aim1 develop and test a non-invasive reporter for proliferation (entry of cells to S-phase of the cell cycle fromG1). This reporter will be used to investigate the efficacy of four targeted therapeutic agents (PTK 787, areceptor Tyrosine Kinase (PDGFR) inhibitor; Perifosine, an AKT inhibitor; CCI 779, an mTOR inhibitor and Cl1040, a MEK inhibitor). In Aim 2 we will use a non-invasive reporter for apoptosis to test the hypothesis thatwhile targeted therapies may not induce apoptosis as single agents, in combination with other targetedtherapies or with traditional therapies induction of apoptosis will correlate with efficacy and enhanced tumorcontrol. In Aim 3, we will develop a reporter for Akt function and use it to test the ability of PTK 787, Cl 779,Cl 1040 and Perifosine to inhibit Akt activity. Each of the three molecular imaging approaches will bevalidated using traditional  gold standard  measures of function of these pathways (e.g. Western blots,immunohistochemistry, kinase assays). We believe that studies proposed in Project 2, will result in thedevelopment of tools that will be invaluable in testing the efficacy of targeted therapeutic agents as well as inoptimization of their dose, schedule and development of the most efficacious combination therapies.Pub. Health: Overall, this research effort will provide the rationale for initiation of clinical trials withcombinations of molecularly targeted therapies for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. In addition,imaging biomarkers for early assessment of treatment response will be identified and validated which willlead to individualization of patient treatment.University of MichiganAnn Arbor, MichiganPHS 398(Rev. 09/04) Page 173 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): ROSS, Brian D.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Core C: Digital Image ProcessingThe goals of the Digital Image Processing Core are to continue provide analytic tools for all projects. Theseunique image analysis tools are necessary for unbiased, accurate, quantitative analysis of temporalvolumetric changes in single and multimodal MRI data sets of lab animals and human patients.Currently all MRI acquisitions independent of weightings for all interval exams of both animal and humanstudies are fully automatically registered to a  reference  data set in the first exam typically using a rotate-translate geometry model; this is a multimodality registration problem using existing software tools. Typicallya T1-weighted, post-Gad sequence, is used as the reference for registering all successive interval examsets. B1-field corrections have been found to be unnecessary thus far. In cases where the acquisitionsinvolve high gradient fields such as those used for diffusion or perfusion weighted imaging, registrations areaccomplished using a full affine model to support correction of shears caused by the gradients. Currently allhuman scan data including both original acquisitions and registered datasets, as well as animal backups, arestored on the Core's disk system. In the future all animal scans will be likewise stored on the Core's diskswhich can be accessed via TCP/IP or SAMBA protocols over 100 Mb ethernet. Of course the Core isresponsible for maintaining data integrity and backup.The core will also develop the ability to track the positions of voxels within treated lesions across intervalexams using high degree of freedom warpings. This facility for both animal and human imaging will supportfurther investigation of the role of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as well as other parameters, e.g.perfusion, as potentially early indicators of therapeutic response. Additionally in the A1 amendment thisCore demonstrated the ability to map histology back to in vivo MRI voxels for animals (where whole head exvivo MRI acquisitions are possible) using only intrinsic scan information (i.e. no implanted fiducials of anykind).Pub.

      "PROJECT 3: Malignant gliomas have a high mortality rate, short median length of survival and impartdevastating consequences to both patients and family. The early identification of tumors responsive totherapy, versus those that are not, would greatly facilitate modifying an ineffective treatment regimen in amore timely fashion. During the initial funding period, we have translated preclinical studies on the utility ofquantitative MRI techniques as early predictors of therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor patients. Our currentclinical study is providing further evidence on the predictive value of diffusion MRI, particularly in terms ofdepiction of the spatial heterogeneity of response. In the proposed study we will intensify the scope ofimaging to more ideally sample the evolution of multiple tissue properties over the treatment interval.Quantitative response indicators under investigation include serial measures of tumor water diffusion, bloodvolume and flow, and microvessel permeability. Pre-treatment proton metabolite status will also beassessed. Each indicator, in its own way, depicts biophysical properties which are relevant to tumor viability,cellular alteration by therapy, as well as accessibility of the tumor to therapy. In Specific Aim 1, we willperform detailed imaging measures on well defined patient populations enrolled in tree UMCC treatmentprotocols in order to obtain definitive validation of the clinical utility of quantitative MRI as an early predictorof treatment response measured a later date by standard criteria. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate theability of these measures to predict local therapeutic response by analyses of sub-tumor regions whichexhibit clearly different patterns of local response apparent at a later date. Our overarching objective inpursuit of these aims is to demonstrate that biophysicaltissue properties measurable by noninvasive imagingare highly relevant to therapeutic outcome. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity of these properties arepredictive of local failure, thus may form the basis for a rational design in spatially-directed treatmentplanning.Pub. Health: Overall, this research effort will provide the rationale for initiation of clinical trials withcombinations of molecularly targeted therapies for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. In addition,imaging biomarkers for early assessment of treatment response will be identified and validated which willlead to individualization of patient treatment.University of MichiganAnn Arbor, MichiganPHS 398(Rev. 09/04) Page 213 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): ROSS, Brian D.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The aims of this project are (1) to understand the molecular basis of the diverse pharmacology ofestrogens, including the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and antiestrogens, (2) todevelop novel inhibitors of estrogen action that act by blocking receptor-coactivator interactions,and (3) to prepare protein microarrays that can be used to study how ligands regulate nuclearreceptor-coregulator interactions on a genome-wide basis. We will apply advanced fluorescencemethodologies to study the conformational dynamics and interactions of the estrogen receptorsERa and ERI3 and their interactions with coregulator proteins and how these are modulated byvarious ER ligands, including the ER subtype-selective ligands we have developed. Specificstudies will focus on the role of protein conformational dynamics and reciprocity in theseinteractions, competition in recruitment of coactivators vs. corepressors, the agonism of SERMssuch as tamoxifen, and ligand regulation of the function of ERc_.ERI3 heterodimers. Usingstructure-based and de novo design, we will develop small molecule coactivator binding inhibitorsthat should block estrogen action at a different level than antiestrogens and might overcomeantiestrogen resistance in breast cancer. Protein microarrays of nuclear hormone receptors orcoregulators will be developed to assay ligand regulation of receptor-coregulator interaction in a rapid, high throughput, genome-wide manner. This project should lead to improved understandingof the molecular basis of estrogen action, novel agents to regulate estrogen activity, and powerfultools for the discovery of novel estrogens and other ligands for nuclear receptors.

      "The overall goal of this work is to understand how the motor cortex constructs movement plans and implementsthem as actions. Previous work in this project demonstrated that neural population activity in the macaquemonkey primary motor cortex (MI) cortex predicts hand trajectory during reaching movements. For MI todirect reaching towards a goal, spatial information about the body and the world must be transformed into amotcr framework. Parietal cortex is likely to provide this spatial framework, but little is known aboutfront oparietal interactions. Parietal area 5d provides direct input to MI and is one likely source of arm motion,gaze, and visual target information. The proposed studies will use 100 electrode recording arrays chronicallyimplanted into 5d and MI to study of neural encoding and interactions during continuous tracking of arandomly moving visual target (CRT task). This novel recording method allows the direct and simultaneousexamination of neurons in two interconnected areas under identical behavioral conditions. The new CRT taskprovides a statistical basis for spike and population analysis of these neurons.AIM 1 experiments will compare 5d and MI neurons during CRT. Motor, gaze and visual signal spatiotemporalreceptive fields will be characterized and neural information content will be evaluated by reconstructing handmotion, eye position and visual signal from population activity. Encoding in each area will be compared todetermine the form and time course of information exchanged. AIM 2 experiments will determine whether 5d-MI networks encode movement in an abstract spatial or body-part based framework. These experiments willfurther test whether information is in hand, joint or muscle coordinates. AIM 3 will test whether 5d-MI networksare engaged in motor plans based on cues that predict the future behavior of the visual stimulus, or aboutmovement based upon internal representations. These experiments will test whether MI -5d networks usepredictive visual cues to construct plans for upcoming movement and whether these networks compute motionsfor learned movement sequences. The proposed experiments will provide new information about corticocorticalcomp'Utations, including their serial and parallel processing and their coordinate frames. They will also help toadvance multielectrode recording technologies and methods for statistical evaluation of single neuron andpopulation coding. Finally, the results of these experiments will be useful in designing neural prosthetic devicesto restore movement in paralyzed humans.3ERFOFIMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Department of Neuroscience, Brown University, Providence, RIKEY PERSONNEL.

      "for three different endogenous pathways that may negativelyregulate PPAR activity. These mechanisms will be studied by examining their modulation of well-establishedin vitro and in vivo models of PPAR activation.LPL-mediated PPARa activation suggests the discrepant endothelial effects of structurally diverse fatty acidsmay be due to differential PPARa activation, including antagonism. In Aim 1, PPAR activation and inhibitionby specific fatty acids will be studied in vitro and in vivo, contrasting omega-3 fatty acids to saturated andtrans-fatty acids. Hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4a) is a poorly understood but critical fatty acid-activated receptor that regulates lipid metabolism, thrombosis, and glucose control. By using themanipulations of lipid metabolism employed in our LPL/PPARa studies, we have identified novelmechanisms of HNF4a modulation and divergent responses between PPARa and HNF4a to pathways oflipid metabolism. In Aim 2, this divergence between HNF4a and PPARa will be explored. A novel butpowerful mechanism for PPAR modulation would be the existence of a direct endogenous PPAR antagonist.While symmetric cleavage of beta carotene generates natural ligands for the RXR nuclear receptor, we haveidentified that asymmetric beta carotene cleavage produces a specific apocarotenal that directly antagonizesPPAR responses. In Aim 3, this direct antagonist will be characterized in vitro and in vivo. Together, thesestudies integrate biochemical, biologic, and in vivo models to better understand how endogenous modulationof PPAR activity may determine biologic responses.KEY PERSONNEL:NamePlutzky, Jorge, MDGaziano, J.

      "Fatty acids (FA) and monoacylglycerol (MG), the hydrolytic products of triacylglycerol (TG), providea major source of dietary energy. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in understanding the basicmechanisms of MG and FA assimilation. These include a molecular level understanding of the individualfunctions of two highly expressed enterocyte fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP), intestinal FABP andliver FABP. In addition, the mechanisms of differential trafficking of MG and FA added to the apical(AP) vs. basolateral (BL) poles of the enterocyte, where AP lipid is more highly incorporated into TG,and BL lipid into phospholipid, are not understood. In this proposal, we will use an integrated approach toaddress the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the polarity of intestinal FA and MG transportand metabolism, and the specific roles of the two enterocyte FABPs in FA transport, lipid metabolism, andlipoportein secretion. Further, we will explore the regulation and function of monoacylglycerol lipase(MGL), which we have recently shown to be expressed in rat intestine. The specific aims are 1) Todetermine the functions of IFABP and LFABP in cellular transport and metabolism of FA and MG:Structure-function studies in model systems, analysis of the apo- and holo-LFABP tertiary structures, anddirect protein transfer of wild type and specific FABP mutant forms into cultured Caco-2 enterocytes, willallow us to determine the individual functions of IFABP and LFABP, and the structural basis for thesefunctional properties; 2) To determine the cellular basis for metabolic compartmentation of FA and MG in theentcrocyte. Studies in rats, mice null for specific enzymes and transport proteins, and Caco-2 cells, will allowus to examine the role of plasma membrane transporters, intracellular FABPs, and specific intracellularenzymes, in the underlying mechanisms of this metabolic divergence; and 3) To explore the role of intestinalmonoacylglycerol lipase, using studies in rodents and cultured cells, MGL is higher in neonatal intestine anddeclines to lower levels in the adult animal, thus we will examine the mechanisms that underlie changes inMGL expression. The ultimate aim of this research program is to understand how to control the rate andextent of dietray lipid assimilation by modulating specific transport and metabolic processes. Suchmodulation has important implications for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemias. PERFORMANCE SI-_E(S) (organization, city, state) 1.

      "Mashl is an essential transcription factor in neural development throughout multiple regionsof the central and peripheral nervous systems. Mashl expression is tightly regulated; it isexpressed in proliferating neural stem cells and is downregulated as the cells become post-mitotic and mature into neurons. Synthesizing results from multiple investigators on Mashlexpression and function, we hypothesize that 1) Mashl expression is controlled by signalsinstructing stem cells to begin the differentiation program, 2) the specificity of function for aparticular bHLH involves interacting factors, and 3) in a neural progenitor cell, Mashl functionsin transcriptional control of some but not all pathways required for neuronal differentiation.Experiments here will address these hypotheses, and identify specific molecular componentsupstream and downstream of this essential neural differentiation factor. We will identify!transcription factors that bind the Mashl enhancer to control Mashl expression in the spinalneural tube. We will identify structural domains in Mashl required for specific functions inneurogenesis and screen for interacting factors that modulate these functions. And finally, wewill identify the specific: regulatory pathways during neuronal differentiation controlled byMashl by analysis of gene expression profiles in multiple loss- and gain-of-function paradigms.Success in this research program will increase our understanding of molecular mechanisms!involved in neural precursor proliferation, differentiation, and specification.

      "The overall goal of this component is to develop and test new alignment medium for dipolar couplingmeasurement and new strategies for obtaining structural restraints in large proteins and protein complexes. In the first phase of this component, we will focus on developing DMA nanostructures for weakly orientingprotein complexes that are solubilized in harsh buffer conditions. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) arecrucial experimental restraints in structure determination of large proteins when long-range NOEs areinsufficient. RDCs are also very useful in orienting domains within protein complexes. Based on our initialsuccess in making DNA nanotubes that can form stable liquid crystal in the presence of high concentration ofdetergents, we will establish a robust protocol for aligning detergent-protein complexes. The membraneprotein systems to be tested include a number of ~30 kDa a helical, polytopic membrane proteins. We willalso test the alignment of the EIF4e-4g complex, an important translation initiation interaction previouslystudied by Wagner and colleagues. This protein complex can only reach NMR-feasible concentration in thepresence of a detergent known as CHAPS. In the second phase, we will develop methods of measuring structural restraints for large helical proteins.Hydrogen bond length has very small variation and serves as extremely stringent distance constraint fordefining secondary structures. Measurement of the small 3JNCg couplings is perhaps the most straightforwardand unambiguous method for determining protein sidechain xi angles. We will implement the relaxationoptimized pulse elements (ROPE) to enable measurement of 3hJNc' across hydrogen bonds and 3JNCg thatdefines sidechain rotamer for large deuterated proteins. We will also develop 4D NOESY and 13C detectionscheme for resolving resonance overlap. For helical proteins larger than 300 amino acids, it is usually notpossible to resolve most of the short-range NOEs in the conventional15N-separated NOESY due to strongoverlap of amide resonances. However, they can be resolved in a 4D 15N- and 13C'- edited NOESY (NOESY-HNCO). We will work with Jeff Hoch's group to significantly shorten the experimental time of 4D NOESY-HNCO by implementing nonuniform sampling and maximum entropy reconstruction methods so that it canbe of practical use. We will also develop 13C-observation strategies for resolving resonance overlap andapply them to the measurements of 15N relaxation rates and RDCs.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MAPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 236 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wagner, GerhardKEY PERSONNEL.

      "We have made the novel discovery that MARCKS protein (Myristoylated Alanine-_Rich C Kinase Substrate) is a key molecule regulating mucin secretion from human bronchial epithelial ceils in vitro, and in mice in vivo. In this renewal, we propose to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms whereby MARCKS controls the secretory process in airway epithelium, utilizing both in vitro and in vivo models. The hypothetical mechanism is a new paradigm for exocytotic release of preformed, membrane-bound secretory granules from airway epithelium. In this mechanism, membrane-bound secretory granules containing pre-formed mucin exist in the cell, associated with a number of specific fusion and docking proteins, as  secreto_ modules.  Each secretory module is fully equipped for fusion with the plasma membrane and resultant exocytotic release of the granule contents into the airway lumen. However, the module lacks the necessary apparatus to tmnslocate to the plasmalemma. This is where MARCKS is critical: MARCKS, phosphorylated by PKC, moves to the cytoplasm, where it is brought to the secretory module by binding to the chaperone, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70). The Hsp 70/MARCKS complex binds to the secretory module via the N-terminus of MARCKS by interaction with a specific granule membrane protein, cysteine string protein (CSP). After its PKG-mediated dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), MARCKS binds to actin/myosin while still attached to the secretory module. Thus, MARCKS links mucin granules to the contractile cytoskeleton. Upon translocation to the plasma membrane, fusion and docking proteins associated with the secretory module (Rab 3, VAMP 2 and VAMP 8) in conjunction with target proteins in the plasmlemma, position the granules for exocytosis. Critical aspects of this mechanism will be addressed utilizing 3 model systems: 1. primary human airway epithelial cells; 2. a human airway epithelial cell line (HBE1); and 3. an in vivo murine model of mucin hypersecretion. The aims will def'me the mechanisms whereby MARCKS binds to Hsp70, how the MARCKS/Hsp70 complex binds to CSP on granule membranes, and specific fusion and docking proteins of the secretory module involved in exocytotic release ofmucin both in vitro and in vivo.PERFORMANCESITE(S)(organizationc, ity,state)North Carolina State UniversityCollege of Veterinary MedicineRaleigh NC, 27695KEYPERSONNEL.SeeinstructionsU.secontinuatiopnagesasneededtoprovidethe requiredinformationintheformast hownbelow.StartwithPrincipaIlnvestigatorL. istallotherkeypersonneilnalphabeticoarlderl,astnamefirst.Name Organization Roleon ProjectKenneth B.

      "Overweight and obesity are increasing rapidly in the U.S., particularlyamong low-income minority populations. Whilegenetic factors no doubt play an important role, environmental and behavioralfactors must surely be drivingthe epidemicgiven its rapid increase in the past decade (Hill and Peters 1998). Recent research suggests that care and feeding stylesduring childhood may be related to subsequent risk of obesity (Johnson and Birch 1994; Birch et al 2000; Black et al 2001)yet little is known about the period when infants make the transitionthrough the weaning period to a family diet or howspecific parenting styles or environments may influencethe development of obesity in very young children(Kumanyika1993). The obesity literature has focused primarily on children during the adiposity rebound period or older, and fewstudies describe risk factors in the first two years of life, when patterns first develop and are under parental or caregivercontrol. This research will examine: 1) household factors that influence parenting and infant feeding patterns; 2)relationship of feeding styles to infant diet; and 3) relationshipof dietary intake to infant fatness. We will conduct the studyamong African American mothers and infants in North Carolina, a group at high risk for the development of obesity. In Phase I, we will conduct in-depth ethnographicresearch that defines culture-specific features of parentingandfeeding and to identify household and contextual factors that may either prevent or promote infant obesity developmentin this population. This is a critical part of the research because it will allow us to define specific indicators related to ourecological model. We will also adapt an existing instrument, the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) (Birch et al 1998;in press), to be culturallyand age-appropriate for administrationamong mothers of African-Americans infants during thelongitudinal study. In Phase II, we will conduct a longitudinal, observational study of 200 mother-infant African-American dyads,Followed from 3-18 months of age. The study is designed to identify the constellation of household, caregiver, andchildcharacteristics associated with the risk of obesity. Infants will be followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months throughassessments in their home environments. We will assess relationships among feeding styles, dietary intake, and infantFatness, while taking into account the role of activity, maternal BMI, and other risk factors.PERFORMANCE S1TE(S) (organization, city, state)Carolina Population Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel HillKEY PERSONNEL.See instructions on Page II.

      "The general objective of the proposed research is to combine a new computational approach withcomplementary NMR methods for characterizing binding of small ligands to proteins. This will address awide need for defining interactions of proteins with natural ligands, such as peptides, non-peptidicbiomolecules, or with non-natural ligands, including drug leads or other chemicals. While this Component 2 is on interactions of small ligands with proteins, this approach can readily beapplied to protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. This connects this research to Components 1and 4. Thus, both aspects address the problem of characterizing weak but specific iinteractions of proteinswith small molecules and other macromolecules in situations where experimental constraints are sparse. We proposeto develop an approach that will build on the recently developed TreeDock algorithm andwill combine it with information from NMR spectroscopy on small-molecule inhibitors of protein-proteininteractions obtained from high-throughput library screening. To define structures of weak protein-inhibitorcomplexes, TreeDock can search the docking space very fast by eliminating up front all configurations inwhich the components to be docked have no contact or penetrate each other. This is achieved with kdsearch trees. The algorithm uses complete enumeration of the search space at high resolution and canhandle ligand mobility by querying a database of docked rigid subgroups. TreeDock can be ideally interfaced with sparse data from NMR experiments. We propose NMR methodsthat can provide few specific protein-ligand contacts even under difficult experimental conditions, such asintermediate exchange or poor solubility. The combination of the computational and experimental NMRmethods will also be capable of dealing with structural changes of receptor proteins upon ligand binding. The research will be pursued four Specific Aims:1: Development of a flexible docking algorithm (TreeDock II) that is capable of screening compound libraries efficiently, docking peptides and DNA/RNA to proteins.2: Development of a compiler (parser, classifier) of chemical compound libraries.3. Experimental methods for measuring NOEs in the intermediate exchange regime and defining anchors for TreeDock - Application to inhibitors of Bcl-2 type proteins.4.

      "Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Greenberg, Harry B. Program Function 8RESEARCH EDUCATION AND TRAININGA. INTRODUCTION AND TRANSFORMING INTENTFor the past five years, the overarching mission of the Stanford University School of Medicine (SoM) hasbeen the translation of discoveries into medical practice. A plan developed in 2001-02 has encouragedtransforming efforts in clinical and translational (CT) education and research by providing the resources tosupport such endeavors. The vision and goals of this plan, Translating Discoveries, are closely alignedwith those of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) effort. The CTSA program hasgiven the SoM an important opportunity to reassess, refine and refocus these efforts and move to anotherlevel in our effort to transform the practice of CTR across the University. The result will be anadministrative home, the Stanford Center for Clinical and Translational Education and Research(SCCTER, pronounced ske-ter), which will totally reshape and focus our efforts in enabling andaccelerating translational medicine while minimizing overlap and maximizing efficiency.More specifically, we have made substantial strides in creating enhanced education and trainingopportunities in clinical and translational research (CTR). Three examples of new and innovativeeducational initiatives include our scholarly concentrations for medical students, our multidisciplinaryBiodesign program for engineers, physicians and other biomedical investigators, and our Masters ofScience in Medicine (MOM) degree for PhD candidates. The scholarly concentration program isembedded in our new medical student curriculum. Of the seven concentrations, the two most popular(clinical research and community health) are directly relevant to CTR education and training. OurBiodesign program represents a unique CTR training opportunity built around teams of physicians,engineers, and postgraduate students learning how to successfully invent medically useful devices. OurMOM degree affords PhD candidates at Stanford the opportunity to matriculate with our first and secondyear medical students, integrating their basic science training with the critical foundations of health andhuman disease and the practice of medicine to provide these students a more fundamental understandingof translational and clinical medicine.In addition to these three recent initiatives, we are attempting to address the future need for well-trainedCT researchers by engaging students earlier in their educational pathway. For example, we host severalsummer science enrichment courses for gifted and disadvantaged high school students. We consider itessential to reach out specifically to low-income and ethnic minority youth, because they are oftenoverlooked by outreach programs. We also are making efforts to encourage more Stanford Universityundergraduate students to enroll in seminar courses directed by faculty with research interests in CTR andto increase opportunities for these students to work on human health related research projects with ourfaculty. Early exposure to CT education and training programs will encourage more of these students toconsider a CTR-related profession.Numerous didactic courses have been developed by many of our CTR stakeholders, including the Department of Health Research and Policy, several clinical departments, the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs,the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC, now the Clinical and Translational Research Unit, Program Function 4), the Center for Biomedical Ethics, and the Stanford/Packard Center for Translational Researchin Medicine (SPCTRM, now the Support Portal, Program Function 3). In addition, our NIH-funded training programs related to CTR (Table 8.1), including 22 T32s, 4 R25s, and 3 K12s, each have developed manyseminar courses and journal clubs. Furthermore, all trainees and faculty have access to Masters degreeprograms in Epidemiology, Health Services Research, and Public Policy, on our campus, and we have ajoint MPH program with the School of Public Health in Berkeley. Other joint degree opportunities areavailable across the University in the School of Humanities and Science (Biological Sciences andBiophysics), the School of Engineering (Bioengineering, Biomedical Informatics, and Biomechanical Engineering), the Graduate School of Business, and the School of Law.Despite our rich educational environment and concerted efforts to develop a wide range of discipline-specific and interdisciplinary education and training programs, the preparation of this application hasstimulated the development of a plan for accelerated improvement. This plan, described below, hasPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 592 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): . Greenberg, Harry B.resulted from a faculty-wide survey and deliberations of a CT Education and Training planning committee.The overall goals of our plan are: ¿ To utilize the considerable faculty and student talent at all seven of Stanford's Schools to improve CT research and education across the enterprise ¿ To recruit, educate, and train a continuum of outstanding future CT investigators ¿ To promote awareness of the value and necessity of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team research ¿ To facilitate and coordinate all of our education and training initiatives in the area of CTR.CTR at Stanford has been carried out primarily by faculty at the SoM, with limited but very fruitfulinteractions with faculty in our other Schools. Our first goal is designed to apply the expertise at Stanford'sseven Schools to CTR by educating faculty and trainees at our other Schools in the importance andmethodology of CTR. Conversely, we also will utilize the considerable expertise at the other Schools tohelp educate the next generation of CT investigators in the SoM. The CTSA will allow us to developprograms to facilitate this cross-School and cross-discipline pollination; this will be transformative for CTresearch and education at Stanford and, potentially, in the country.Our second goal, to support a continuum of trainees, is critical for several reasons. Engaging traineesearly in their career will encourage them to pursue careers in CTR, thereby ensuring the development of asteady pipeline of CTR investigators. Trainees along the continuum will be able to assist the next tier oftrainees by acting as near-to-peer role models. Trainees late in the continuum will develop leadershipskills while assuming oversight responsibilities for more junior colleagues. The continuum also will providea defined pathway, from novice to expert, affording trainees the opportunity to increase their level ofknowledge and expertise as they advance academically.Our third goal is to conduct meaningful multidisciplinary exercises that include affiliated nurse scientistsand allied health researches, and to build research projects that will encourage and foster collaborationsboth within and outside the SoM. Since translational medicine is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinaryby nature, a comprehensive educational program should include participation of students from both theMD and PhD pathways and should integrate these programs so that trainees receive maximum exposureto other disciplines. We plan to teach this multidisciplinary approach through participation in our six-weekteam-building practicum exercises. These teams will be composed of members from multiple disciplineswith varied educational backgrounds.Our fourth goal, to facilitate and coordinate all current education and training initiatives, will be critical tosupporting our continuum of trainees, building our multidisciplinary programs, and eliminating unnecessaryduplication of efforts. A key component of this goal is to take advantage of  teachable moments  in thestudy design process (Program Function 3: Support Portal) as opportunities for training and as sources of didactic material. , A.1. InnovationThe organization and structure of the education and training programs that we propose will transform theCTR learning environment at Stanford through an integrated and cross-pollinating design. We will recruitprofessionally diverse trainees along the continuum from high school students to junior faculty, withspecial outreach to under-represented young adults, and with multiple interactions between the traininglevels. We will foster individual and collaborative learning by creating innovative multidisciplinary teams.We will support innovation by creating new advanced degree programs at the Masters- and PhD-level;these programs will train MD and PhD investigators who understand the importance of, and methods for,translating basic scientific discoveries into improved human health for the community at large. Most importantly, we will bring the greater Stanford community's considerable assets and expertise to bear on CTR and CTR-related education. B. SPECIFIC AIMSOur CTR Education, Training, and Career Development Programs will address the critical shortage of well-trained CT investigators and the need for multidisciplinary CTR teams by devoting programs to each level of trainee. Our five specific aims are: Aim 1. To engage the broader Stanford University community in CTR education, training, and career development.PHS 398/2590(Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 593 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First. Middle): Greenberg, Hairy B.Education and training in CTR at Stanford University primarily has involved pre- and postdoctoral studentsin the SoM. Although Stanford does not have other health professional Schools, such as nursing, dentistryand pharmacy, we do have world class discipline-specific Schools of engineering, law,business, earthsciences, education, and humanities and science, as well as a strong tradition of Interdisciplinary Centersthat leverage expertise across the campus to approach specific interdisciplinary subjects such as CTR.With CTSA funding and the development of SCCTER, we intend to develop programs and projects thatincrease the interconnectedness of students and faculty across the seven Schools of our University withthe goal of bringing the broad interdisciplinary expertise available at Stanford to bear on CT research andeducation. Aim 2. To develop a T32 predoctoral comprehensive CTR training program that will include an MS in Medicine and an MS and PhD in Epidemiology or Health Services Research.The objective of Stanford's Predoctoral Clinical Research Training Program will be to provide theenvironment and educational infrastructure that will offer medical students and PhD candidates anunderstanding of, experience with, and appreciation for, CTR. This program also will support their trainingin the principles and practice of CTR. The program will offer students of varied professional backgroundsthe knowledge and skills necessary to: ¿ Understand how basic laboratory discoveries can be translated into clinical application and how critical clinical problems can be identified and cycled back to the bench for solution ¿ Appreciate how basic science tools can enrich the design and conduct of clinical research ¿ Comprehend the scientific principles underlying the design, conduct, and analysis ofCTR ¿ Understand the public health issues, and how epidemiology and health services research can complement clinical research ¿ Understand the process by which important research findings are translated into best practices and how these practices can be most effectively introduced into the community ¿ Realize the value of conducting research as members of interdisciplinary teams ¿ Appreciate problems faced by research study patients both before and during a studyThe predoctoral training program will be comprised of several components including: Masters of Medicine(MOM) for PhD students, Scholarly Concentrations for medical students, Masters and PhD degrees inEpidemiology and Health Services Research, and a design team program. Aim 3. To foster resident interest in careers inCTR.The decision to pursue a career in CTR often is made during residency training. However, becauseresidency is heavily focused on the mastery of clinical skills, there is limited time to participate in clinicalresearch education programs or to conduct research projects. We will transform the traditional residencytraining experience to stimulate and foster resident interest in CTR by: (1) embedding CTR education inresidency curricula, (2) offering a one-week intensive CTR course, and (3) developing a pilot program inthe Department of Pediatrics that affords the opportunity for meaningful research involvement during residency. Aim 4. To support the development of both MD and PhD scientists interested in careers in CTR.The overarching goal of our proposed K12 program is to recruit MD and PhD postdoctoral trainees into amultidisciplinary CTR training program that stimulates their interest in academic careers in the field. Theproposed training will provide candidates with strong mentorship, didactic training in clinical research methodologies, and practical research and writing experience.To realize their full potential, CTR Scholars will be trained to work in close collaboration with partners fromdifferent fields. This has become increasingly important as the methodology of clinical research has become substantially more sophisticated and the tools to produce, manage and analyze resulting scientificdata have become more powerful and complex. Additional challenges have resulted from the proliferationof regulatory guidelines governing clinical investigation.As part of our K12 initiative, we plan to expand our unique and highly successful, cross-disciplinaryBiodesign program. In addition, we will initiate the Advanced Residency Training Program at Stanford(ARTS), affording MD clinical fellows the opportunity to pursue a PhD in a research area that complements their clinical interests and fosters translation of new discoveries to clinical medicine.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04. Reissued 4/2006) Page 594 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Greenberg, Harry B. Aim 5. To centralize and coordinate Stanford CTR education, training, and career development programs.We plan to create a CTR Education and Training Coordinating Office to provide oversight and efficientmanagement of all of our programs, on behalf of all levels of trainees. This office will be responsible formaintaining a database of students and clinical research personnel who are interested in participating inany of our education and training programs. A comprehensive and centralized mentoring program will bedeveloped, in coordination with the Council of Mentors in the CTRU (Program Function 4) and the Centerfor Innovative Study Design (CISD; Program Function 1). Finally, with the assistance of the TranslationalInformatics Program (Program Function 2), a database will be developed that will include all mentors andtrainees in CTR along with descriptions of their research interests. This will be used for matching mentorsand trainees in addition to tracking and evaluating the program.The CTR office will serve as a single source of information for seminars, courses, training programs, andexisting opportunities to join interdisciplinary clinical and translational science research teams. In additionto tracking all existing opportunities to participate in research projects, this office also will be responsiblefor developing and overseeing our innovative multidisciplinary. design team exercises. These exercises willafford all trainees the chance to work in a team environment. Through this centralized and coordinatedeffort, any gaps in CTR education and training will be identified and addressed in a timely manner.Importantly, the CTR office that we envision will foster synergies by bridging Stanford's academic andclinical enterprises, linking investigators, faculty, students, trainees, clinicians, and affiliated students whoshare a commitment to CTR education, training, and research.The CTR office also will serve to coordinate and expand several successful Stanford University and SoMeducation and training programs designed to expose low-income and gifted high school students to CTR.This will (1) stimulate long-term interest in a career in the biological sciences or medicine, therebyexpanding the pipeline of available investigators, (2) prepare the students for the transformation ofbiomedical research, which increasingly focuses on team-based, interdisciplinary efforts, and (3)encourage a more diverse CTR workforce.C. BACKGROUNDC.1. Progress to DateDuring the past five years, we have taken important steps towards enhancing and expanding theeducation, training, and career development of clinical and translational investigators at Stanford. Our nextstep is to create a seamless and fully integrated program that is accessible to all levels of trainees fromacross our University and Medical Center. Furthermore, we will use our success at building meaningfulmultidisciplinary collaborations (e.g., Biodesign Program) to formally frame other synergies between thewealth of programs that exist across Stanford's seven discipline-specific Schools and 15 InterdisciplinaryCenters (see Overall Approach section). The formation of SCCTER will allow us to build an academichome and facilitate the integration of our educational programs, while enhancing accessibility andcoordination and assuring long-term and sustained success on behalf of our continuum of professionallydiverse trainees.Some of the key educational initiatives that have been developed at Stanford include high school scientificenrichment programs, a multidisciplinary Biodesign effort to teach innovation and inventorship, theScholarly Concentration program for medical students, and a Masters of Science in Medicine degreeopportunity for PhD candidates. We also have expanded the breadth and depth of short courses in clinicalresearch for ail members of our clinical and translational research community, including MD and PhDstudents, clinical (MD) and basic science (PhD) postdoctoral trainees, clinical research nurses, researchassociates, and faculty across the University. The expansion of these educational efforts and theintegration of these current and proposed efforts into a coordinated CTR training and career development program under SCCTER is described below. C.2. Institutional CommitmentStanford University is committed to multidisciplinary education and research programs that enhance collaboration across the University. In 2004, our University President, John Hennessy, formed a Commission on Graduate Education (CGE) to review graduate programs and consider how Stanford couldcontinue to evolve graduate education in light of the changing challenges and opportunities facing ourPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued4/2006) Page 595 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Greenberg, Harry B.graduate students. In his charge to this Commission, President Hennessy stated:  Our challenge as aleading educational institution is to prepare our graduates to be leaders in finding solutions for the large-scale, complex problems of the 21st century. Dealing with the issues of our day, such as globalization, theimpact on society of rapid scientific and technological advances, emerging and chronic health careproblems, and the effects of human activities on the environment, demands new approaches that arecreative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary. A report of the Commission delivered to the University Senate in the spring of. 2006 concluded that ourgraduate education programs, in addition to providing students with deep and rich disciplinary expertise,needed to offer both students and faculty ample opportunities (and incentives) to  interact with a diversegroup of colleagues from across the University, building networks of contacts who can assist them while atStanford and throughout their careers and to develop the knowledge and skills needed to be effectiveleaders in their chosen fields.  Stanford has embraced this interdisciplinary approach and is poised toboth support the training of individuals interested in pursuing academic careers as CTR investigatorsacross the enterprise and to utilize the resources throughout Stanford to educate CT researchers. Inparallel, the leaders of our non medical professional Schools have encouraged their students to engage insome of the research and training opportunities at the SoM. For example, engineering and businessstudents actively participate in the Biodesign research teams; law students matriculate with medicalstudents in a biomedical ethics certificate program; and undergraduate students frequently participate inCTR projects under the direction of faculty members from the SoM.These efforts by the Commission on Graduate Education are well-aligned with the SoM comprehensivestrategic plan, Translating Discoveries, which has put translational research as its foremost researchmission and education as its centerpiece. Evidence that our School is committed to facilitating CTR andthe education of CTR investigators includes: ¿ Aligning the leadership of medical education at the SoM with oversight of the CTR education and training programs, by the appointment of Charles Prober, MD, as Senior Associate Dean for Education. ¿ Revision of the medical school curriculum to include required scholarly concentrations, including concentrations focused on translational, clinical, and health services research. ¿ Funding the Medical Scholars Program, which provides support for medical students to pursue hypothesis-driven research projects ranging in duration from three months to one year. ¿ Making Master degrees in Epidemiology and Health Services Research accessible for undergraduates, medical students, graduate students in other disciplines, and postdoctoral fellows. ¿ Approval of Masters of Science in Medicine program for PhD students. ¿ Allowing students from other schools to attend courses offered through theSoMD. PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONBecause translational medicine is inherently both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary in nature, acomprehensive CTR education program should include trainees from both the MD and PhD pathways,should work towards filling the gaps in each pathway, and should integrate these programs so thattrainees receive maximum exposure to other disciplines and to each other. Our goal is to create a fullyintegrated, University-wide, CTR community that stimulates and educates all levels of trainees interestedin investigational careers focused on human health. The continuum of trainees extends from studentsparticipating in our high school summer programs to faculty supported by NIH Mentored Patient-Orientedand Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Awards (K23 & K08,respectively). Trainees alongthis continuum include: high school students interested in biomedical careers; Stanford Universityundergraduates interested in careers in medicine (premedical students), basic biology, or other healthrelated disciplines like public health or health policy; medical students focused on future academic careersin clinical and translational science; PhD students pursuing advanced training in a biological science; MDresidents and fellows; PhD postdoctoral fellows seeking training that enhances their ability to work onmultidisciplinary translational research teams; and a variety of other professionals such as law,psychology, anthropology, economics, and business students with an interest in health related issues. TheCTSA will coordinate oversight of our existing programs serving this broad spectrum of trainees and thedevelopment of several new advanced degree programs.

Since Stanford University does not have Schools of nursing, dentistry, public health, orpharmacy, our approach to education of these critical partners in the CTR enterprise will be distinct frommany other CTSA efforts. These allied health professionals will have access to all of our training andcareer development opportunities and will be key members of our research teams. Career developmentand training opportunities will include areas such as leadership (Program Function 11: CareerDevelopment and Diversity), ethics (Program Function 7: Ethics), and regulatory issues (Program Function3: Support Portal). Furthermore, a database of mentors and trainees and their research will be availablefor mentor matching.SCCTER will support enhanced coordination and oversight of our existing programs serving this spectrumof trainees and the development of several advanced degree programs focused on expanding the pipelineof clinical and translational scientists. The integration and coordination of these disparate educationalprograms will be transformative at Stanford, where a concerted effort to link health related issues acrossmultiple disciplines and all levels of training has not existed previously. This effort is described below.Aim 1 is a broad aim designed to focus the vast expertise present at all of Stanford's seven Schools andits various Independent Centers on the challenge of educating the next generation of CT investigators.Aims 2-4 of our program are sequentially organized according to the progression of trainees along theireducational pathway.

DO NOT EXCEEDTHE SPACEPROVIDED. n 2007, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (DAB) and its affiliates completed three important, large-scale strategic planning efforts. Together, these processes generated a  blueprint for our research future :hat lays the foundation to transform our substantial clinical and translational research enterprise throughntegration and innovation across all disciplines, Schools, and our health care system. This transformationwill be driven by the DAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS).The CCTS vision is to transform the DAB environment by building productive and efficient interdisciplinaryresearch teams through educational ingenuity, regulatory reorganization, resource coordination, andmethodological innovation. The mission is to develop a transformative infrastructure that spans the spectrumfrom preclinical research to bench-to-bedside translation (T1 research) to community implementation (T2research), and will meet 5 goals: 1) transform the Investigator; 2) transform the Training Environment; 3)transform the Resource Infrastructure; 4) transform the Approach to Interdisciplinary Research via anemphasis on outcomes research and health disparities research; and 5) establish a new Research Modelthrough the Self-Monitoring and Improvement Program.To meet these goals, the CCTS will rely on: 1) a re-organized reporting structure that assures the PI fullinstitutional support in implementing the CCTS roadmap; 2) a revised CCTS leadership that includes facultyfrom the Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Nursing, Health Professions, and Optometry; and 3) innovativepartnerships involving UAB, Southern Research Institute (ouraffiliated, not-for-profit research organizationfor preclinical drug discovery/development), the Children's Health System, the HudsonAlpha Institute forBiotechnology, the greater Birmingham community, and a long-standing collaborative network that involvesHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and underprivileged communities in our region.UAB, the Health System, Health Services Foundation, Research Foundation, and Southern ResearchInstitute have made substantial commitments to the CCTS including: 1) significant new funding for theclinical and translational research infrastructure (~$150 million, of which over $18 million are directly forCCTS activities and programs); 2) a redesigned and enhanced biomedical informatics infrastructure; and 3)over 20,000 sf of prime clinical and administrative space. When combined, the re-organized CCTSgovernance and leadership, the substantial commitment of funds and resources, the interdisciplinary cultureof UAB, and the new CCTS programs, will create a transformed environment for clinical and translational research that will benefit our trainees, investigators, patients, community, and the national CTSA effort.\n",

We believe these targeting agents, when radiolabeled (e.g. with Y) or conjugated to liposomes containing chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin (e.g. Doxil(R)), can be used as highly specific therapeutic agents for ovarian cancer. Through screening one-bead one-compound combinatorial peptide libraries, we have already identified peptide ligands that can target ovarian cancer in the xenograft model. In this application, we propose to use combinatorial chemistry, molecular modeling methods, and other biophysical techniques to further optimize our lead compounds, and to characterize the compounds with respect to binding specificity and affinity of, as well as their biochemical effects on normal and malignant ovarian cancer cells. We believe these peptides, when conjugated onto the surface of Doxil(R), will be able to facilitate the delivery of doxorubicin to the tumor, and therefore will preferentially kill the tumor cells.Research performance locations:UC-Davis Cancer Center, Research III, 4645 2nd Ave, suite #1300 Sacramento, CA95817KEY PERSONNEL.

The control of trophoblast differentiation was alongstanding area of both interest and activity in our lab,in which we had used primary cultures as well asestablished human choriocarcinoma cell lines. In collaboration with James Thomson, we had previouslyshown that nonhuman primate ESC have an enhanced ability to differentiate into trophoblasts in comparison tomouse ESC (14, 15), an observation subsequently also determined for human ESC (13). However, thisdifferentiation was still found to be of low efficiency in hESC. Thus, during this time period, we initiatedindependent studies in the laboratory to determine whether we could devise alternative experimental systemsin which the ability to differentiate into trophoblasts was enhanced. Soon after we obtained resultsdemonstrating the instructive effects of extracellular matrix on trophoblast differentiation (below), werecognized that the embryoid body paradigm represented an opportunity to develop a unique model forstudying early events in placental morphogenesis, and we began to collaborate with Dr. Zheng in the P01 todevelop the background data and the tools for the studies proposed in Projects //, III and IV. Thus, we are nowfocusing our efforts on the hESC paradigms we have developed for modeling placental morphogenesis andPHS 398/2590 (Rev.09/04) IV-21 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director(Last, First, Middle): MagneSS, R.R.

Although hCG secretion is detectable in spontaneously differentiating ESCcultures (18,and Gerami and Golos, unpublished), the typically modest levels of hCG secretion indicate thatspontaneous trophoblast differentiation, while consistently detectable, is not extensive. We consideredembryoid bodies (EBs) as an alternative model to evaluate trophoblast differentiation from hESC. EBs wereprepared generally as previously described (32). Within 2 days after the initiation of suspension EB culture,the secretion of hCG, progesterone and estradiol was detectable in the culture medium, in comparison withunconditioned medium (Fig. 3).Reasoning that the EBs may be a good model for not only trophoblast differentiation, but also perhapsplacenta! morphogenesis, we initiated pilot studies to evaluate EB cell growth in an ECMenvironment as a firstapproximation of implantation in the uterine endometrium. We cultured EBs in suspension for 9 days, andtransferred them individually to 50-100 ul volume drops of growth factor reduced (BD Biosciences) Matrigelwhich had been allowed to gel at 37¿C. The Matrigel  rafts  containing the EBs were then transferred to freshPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04) IV-22 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Magness, R.R.

Pleasesee Core B for details on embryoid body formation and culture in Matrigel.Fig. 5. Trophoblast-like outgrowths projecting from thesurfaces of representative EBs explanted to Matrigel rafts. With these cultures, we noted a frequent appearance of projections from the surface of the EBs (Fig. 5). Although the appearance of the outgrowths was heterogeneous, virtually all EBs exhibited outgrowths into the Matrigel environment. These Matrigel-embedded EBs were maintained in culture for up to 50 days, and we determined hCG secretion into the culture medium (Fig. 4). Replicate cultures had medium replaced every 1, 3 or 5 days. While hCG secretion was detectable but relatively modest for the first 20 days in culture, there was a dramatic increase in hCG secretion that occurred reproducibly at approximately day 20 (three independent experiments are shown in Fig. 4). High levels of hCG (andprogesterone and estradiol-17p) secretion were sustained for at least 4 weeks, and daily medium changepromoted the highest level of hCG secretion. Additional experiments with delayed transfer to Matrigeldemonstrated that exposure to matrix and not age of the EB was the critical element in the initiation oftrophoblast differentiation (Appendix). Comparing secretion rates in suspension vs. Matrigel culture, anincrease of > 10,000-fold induction is typical. Thus, the dramatic increase in hormone secretion followingMatrigel explantation suggests that in suspension EBs, trophoblasts are relatively undifferentiated but thatMatrigel exposure promotes cells from a progenitor/stem trophoblast, to a committed cell undergoing terminaldifferentiation. IHC studies demonstrate readily discerned populations of cytokeratin/hCG-positive cells. Weconclude that trophoblast-like cells differentiate in EB cultures.Given these results, we wished to determine if association of EBs with Matrigel under  two-dimensional conditions was sufficient to promote long-term hormone secretion. This is particularly important with regards toour ability to evaluate differentiation on diverse matrix surfaces. We conducted experiments with suspensionEB cultures transferred to culture dishes and allowed to adhere to a thin coating of Matrigel on the culturesurface (Fig. 6, also Appendix). .EB plated on Matrigel coated plates12001000E 800 [IO 600 [¿400 .200 ' T J A n n n fi H III 1 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 25 Day of CultureFig. 6.

Pjt.IV PI: GolOS, T.G.The results demonstratethat hCG, progesteroneand estradiol-17p secretion beganto increaseapproximately10 days after attachmentto the culture surface and was sustainedfor 2-4 weeks, depending on the thicknessofthe Matrigel.For several of the replicate wells in this experiment, we wished to determine if the outgrowths could bepassaged and replated and would sustain proliferation. Cellular outgrowths were resuspended followingtrypsin treatment and were replated on Matrigel-coated plates. Cells were readily adherent and continued toproliferate, and passagedcells in all wells exhibited at least some syncytiumformation (Fig. 7), characteristicof both primary human villous cytotrophoblast cultures as well as BMP4-treated hES cells (16,33). Inaddition, hCG, progesterone and estradiol secretion was maintained through at least two passageswith thesecells (not shown). Similar results have been obtained in experiments with cytokeratin-positive cells dispersedfrom suspension EBs with limitedtrypsin digestion.EB outgrowths on individual ECMcomponents. Wehave begun to conduct preliminary experiments onthedifferentiation of trophoblastic outgrowths from hESC-derived embryoid bodies, as assayed by hCG secretion.Initial results are shown in Fig. 8, which presents hCG levels in EBs plated in 2-dimensional culture onMatrigel, laminin, and poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. While culture on Matrigel promotes the highest secretion ofhCG, laminin (Fig. 8) and collagen IV (not shown) also promote substantially higher levels than other surfaces,includingpoly-l-lysine. Hormone secretion is not due to substantially different EB adhesion (cell number, day2)or proliferation (cell number, day 24) (Fig.9).

      "The goal of our work is the structural elucidation of the large multiprotein assemblies involved in RNApolymerase II transcription. We have isolated and performed preliminary structural studies on a chromatin-remodeling complex (RSC), general transcription factors, and Mediator. Specific aims for the project period arestructure determination of (1) general transcription factor H, (2) RNA polymerase II - general transcription factorcomplexes, (3) Mediator and Mediator - RNA polymerase II complexes, and (4) RSC and RSC - nucleosomecomplexes. Our efforts will culminate in the structure determination of a complete 48-protein RNA polymeraseII transcription initiation complex, and of a RSC-nucleosome complex in the transcriptionally activated state. Inview of the size of these complexes, almost all greater than one million Daltons, structures will be determined bycryoelectron microscopy and image processing. Wherever possible, 2-D crystals will be formed on lipid layers,permitting image processing by Fourier analysis. In the absence of crystals, image processing will be done bysingle particle analysis. The results should reveal the molecular basis of transcriptional activation, initiation,andregulation. They will be directly relevant to human disease. For example, mutations in subunits of factor H areresponsible for a number of inherited human disease syndromes. Mutations in RSC or RSC-related proteins areimplicated in oncogenesis.=>ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Stanford UniversitySchool of MedicineStanford, California 94305-5126KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Bacterial pathogens have evolved adaptive responses to the environmental changes encountered when theyenter a host from an external reservoir. These responses include modifications of the bacterial cell envelopethat enhance the ability to colonize, spread to different tissues, and avoid the hosts' normal defenses. Thesynthesis of accessory structures such as antiphagocytic capsules, adhesive fimbriae, and new integralmembrane proteins are examples of host-associated surface modifications. Modifications to essential cellmembrane components such as lipid A [the hydrophobic membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], areimportant for pathogenesis. These and other virulence-related adaptations are often coordinately regulatedvia two-component signal sensing and transduction systems that respond to environmental changes (e.g., oftemperature, osmotic pressure, pH, and concentrations of specific ions). In preliminary studies, we foundthat in response to a change of temperature during growth, from 21¿C to 37¿C, to mimic the bacterial  flea tomammal  (or external environment to mammal) life cycle, Yp synthesized unique lipid A structures. Theseenvironmentally-regulated lipid A structures conferred resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAP),and promote altered host inflammatory responses. Thus, temperature-dependent alteration of lipid Astructure (to a less endotoxic form) upon entry into the mammalian host may represent a pathogenesisstrategy common to the Yersiniae.This proposal contains experiments to define and to elucidate the mechanism of the synthesis ofenvironmentally-regulated lipid A structures from Yersinia pestis, and to also define the lipid A structures ofFrancisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei, potential agents of bioterrorism. In addition, the roleof these specific lipid A structures in affecting the innate immune system of the host will be determined.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Obesity has reached epidemic proportions and its secondary health consequences are dependent on whiteadipose tissue (WAT) distribution with visceral fat increasing their incidence and severity. We study anaturally occurring photoperiodic obesity in Siberian hamsters because it shares the differential regulation ofvisceral vs subcutaneous WAT distribution with humans. This obesity is reversible by moving hamsters fromlong 'summer-like' to short 'winter-like' days (SDs) and is mediated by pineal melatonin (MEL). SDs trigger agreater increase in lipolysis by visceral vs subcutaneous WAT through the sympathetic nervous system(SNS) innervation of WAT. We continue and broaden our focus on this obesity to include other lipolyticstimuli and ask: How does the SNS control the differential mobilization of lipid from WAT? In Aim 1, we testfor convergence of brain SNS outflow projections to different WAT pads, brown fat and adrenal medullausing multiple variants of a transneuronal viral tract tracer (pseudorabies virus [PRV]). We also test for co-localization of neurons activated by acute lipolytic stimuli (cold, glucoprivation) using c-fos, with PRV-labeledWAT SNS outflow neurons. We test for co-localization of neurotransmitter receptors involved in lipolysis,using in situ hybridization with PRV-labeled WAT SNS outflow neurons. We test for differences in SNS drivepatterns across WAT pads by these acute lipolytic stimuli via norepinephrine turnover (NETO). In Aim 2, weitest if implants of a MEL receptor antagonist at MELla receptor + PRV-labeled WAT SNS brain sites blockiSD-induced lipolysis. We test if SNS WAT denervation blocks SD-induced increases in WAT lipolysis/lipidutilization gene expression. We test which fat cell adrenoceptor subtypes underlie SD-induced SNS lipolysisby in vitro glyerol release assays in isolated adipocytes. In Aim 3, if WAT sensory denervation exaggeratesacute- (cold, glucoprivation) and chronic (SDs)-induced WAT NETO. These studies will provide newlinformation on the role of the WAT SNS innervation in lipid mobilization and obesity reversal. )ERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Department of Biology, Kell Hall and Natural Science Annex, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Over the last decade systematic data on long term care (LTC) use in the U.S. has become increasinglyavailable. This has made it possible to create person-level data files of LTC patients linked to pertinentcharacteristics of providers and local health care markets. The availability of such linked  micro  level dataaggregated to the provider, market and state levels enables powerful novel hypothesis testing and policyanalysis of how frail older patients are served by the health care system in ways. Furthermore, primary data,when properly connected to a set of analytic questions, makes it possible to greatly enhance the utility andvalidity of the secondary data that is already available. The PDC Core unifies the LTC P01, will serve all four proposed research projects in the first three yearsof the program project, and will contribute to data dissemination efforts undertaken by the Leadership andAdministration Core. This will be done by designing, testing, and implementing integrated nationally-representative surveys of nursing home administrators and Directors of Nursing (Provider Surveys) andimplementing a survey of state policy makers. The primary data will then be transferred to the Statistics,Measurement, & Data Management Core for integration into the overall program project data base.Aims of the Primary Data Collection Core are to: 1) Design, test, and implement interrelated surveys of long-term care providers to allow linkage with extant patient, provider, market, and state policy data; 2) Create a stratified random national probability sample of nursing home facilities for surveys of long- term providers; 3) Determine the non-response error in the interrelated surveys of long-term care providers; and 4) Design, test, and implement surveys of state Medicaid agencies for linkage with extant patient, provider, market and state policy data. Lay Summary: Primary data in the form of surveys will be collected from Administrators and Directors ofNursing from up to 2150 nursing homes and from state Medicaid officials in the 48 contiguous states toevaluate the impact of state policies on nursing home providers' choices and the outcomes that patientsexperience.Brown UniversityCenter for Gerontology and Health Care ResearchBox G-StProvidence, Rl 02912PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page Form Page 2 180 Clark, Melissa A.

The Program is administered by the SPORE Director, Dr. David Sidransky.The emphasis is on recruitment of young or less established investigators from the talented pool throughoutthe Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions to direct their research career focus upon translational progress in headand neck cancer.The positions are advertised in official Johns Hopkins University and Hospital publications and in memorandato department and division heads. Moreover, we use informal networking among the faculty throughout theinstitution which is also emphasized. The advertisements consist of the following: A. A description of the position (career development of new or established investigators that wish to redirect their efforts specifically in the area of translational research into head and neck or thyroid cancer) B. A statement that two-three positions are available, each offer approximately $50,000/year of salary support C. A statement that candidates will be selected by the Career Development Committee with approval by the SPORE Steering Committee. D. A list of selection criteria and of the Committee members (see below). E. Applications are due by a set date each February, for starting dates of the following July 1. This distribution of dates has encouraged departments to cooperation with the SPORE to plan ahead, in order to protect the research time of the awardee and maximize their translational career F. Inquiries should be made to David Sidransky MD, Professor of Oncology, Otolaryngology, and Pathology, CRB II 5N.03, The Johns Hopkins Univ. School of Medicine, 1550 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231; Phone 410-502-5155, Fax 410-614-1411, email dsidrans@jhmi.edu G. The Johns Hopkins University is an Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action Employer. Minorities, women, Vietnam-era veterans, disabled veterans, and individuals with disabilities are encouraged to apply.In addition to the advertisement, a letter including the advertisement is sent to each of the departmentchairpersons in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and School of Public Health as part of ourrecruiting approach to identify candidates. Recruitment of qualified women and minorities is a high priority ofthe Program, and such prospective candidates are approached and encouraged to apply. Such candidatesare sought by annual inquiry of department/Division chairs from Medicine, Oncology, Otolaryngology,Pathology, Radiation Oncology, Endocrinology, and Public Health and from personal contacts of the CareerDevelopment Committee and Steering Committee. For example, in the history of the program, of nine awardrecipients, two female and seven males were selected, representing (in terms of country/ethnicity of theiryouth) Korean, Canadian, and Chinese origin. In each selection process, the best candidates based on merithave been the award recipients, a testament to the comparable quality of minority applicants.We have added Dr Jean Ford from the school of public health to help us to continue to build the program andto recruit additional minority applicants.Additional resources have always been made available due to the flexible funding of the SPORE, as in thecurrent year, to expand the program to include additional highly attractive candidates. Often, the primarydepartment contributes heavily to the recruitment and start up of these investigators. However, it s oftenSPORE funding that encourages these researchers into Hopkins and the translational HNwork.Prospective candidates are requested to submit a Biographical Sketch on NIH PHS form 398, and a one to oneand a half page description of their career goals and interests in translational research, past experience, and aBiographical Sketch of the proposed mentor. The submitted materials are reviewed by the CareerDevelopment Committee.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 371 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Sidransky, David Career DevelopmentMemberDavid Sidransky,MDArlene Forastiere, MDMartin Abeloff, MDCharles Rudin, MD PhDWilliam Westra, MD PhDJean Ford MD, MPHCareer Development Committee Position Major PerspectivePI, Career Develop.PI, Project 4PI, Cancer Center Core GrantCo PI UAD programPI, TissueCoreBloomberg School of Public HealthSPORE DirectorCO Director SPORECancer Center DirectorTranslational clinical trialsTranslational laboratory scienceHealth Policy, minorityrecruitmentThe criteria for selection of individuals for supportare: A.

Not responsive to Program guidelinesIn addition, Committee members rank the applicants in overall order of preference for funding. The meanrating and mean rank of each applicant are calculated and the Committee then meets to discuss theapplicants. The two individuals selected must be approved by unanimous vote of the Career DevelopmentCommittee. The successful applicants and their chairmen are notified in writing.Careful records of the proceedings are maintained to document the search process with the assumption thatthe Committee may need to defend the final decision. Notes on telephone contacts with candidates or theoutside reviewer are made and filed. The genderand race/ethnicity of the applicant pool is always formallydiscussed in relationship to the candidates who areselected.We are aware that the quality of the proposed science is not necessarily the only predictor of the relativebenefit to be conveyed by our Career Development program. We also recognize, however, that moderninstitutions do not readily invest in even the most selective candidates and that the most attractive candidatesare often lost to private practice and industry, andthus we maintain the quality of the science as our maincriterion. As discussed below, the absence of significant independent funding is also an indication that acandidate represents a productive use of Career Development investment, and is used in the decision process.The potential for growth within the program and for interactions within the translational environment areadditional major considerations.The Evaluation of Progress is conducted yearly for each awardee. The Career Development Program-fundedindividuals submit a yearly progress report that isformally reviewed by the Committee. In addition, the mentoris interviewed to discuss the progress of the individual. The Program's success is convincingly shown whenthese individuals achieve independent funding fortheir translational research. In some cases, successfulPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 372 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Sidransky, David Career Developmentcareer growth occurs when an awardee is successfully recruited to an attractive outside position, a sharing ofthe translational research cultures among institutions.Changes in Candidates may be necessitated because of progress to significant independent funding status.Poor progress is also possible, but unlikely due to the stringency of the selection process. As part of the yearlyprogress evaluation, the Committee will consider the current status of each candidate. Candidates will be ableto request a change in status, expected to be made in consultation with their mentor. Changes in the statuswill be made by a four-sixths vote of the Career Development Committee with unanimous approval of theSPORE Steering Committee.A Requirement for Full-Time Research was part of Request for Application that led to the initiation of thisProgram. Although we have selected full-time research faculty for receipt of the $44-50,000 in CareerDevelopment support, we have been flexible to address the disparity between required effort and availablesalary support, and to allow clinical activities that foster translational science. We do not now follow a strictrequirement for full-time research. For example, Dr. Moon began his faculty appointment in Otolaryngology asa research-only position, but later added occasional oncology services as part of his translational research, afeature that took advantage of his being a board-certified medical Oncologist.Indicate the prospective mentors/consultants who have experience in translational research and whowill interact directly with career development candidates.Our prospective mentors are drawn primarily from our Internal Advisory Committee, Steering Committee, andall Project Principal Investigators. For many of these prospective mentors, details of their research interestsare best gleamed from the Research Projects described in other pages of this application and theirbiosketches. However, Dr Sidransky is always involved in the development of each candidate and meetsformally with them every quarter to assess their progress, relationship with the main mentor, and to discussimmediate and longer term career plans. Dr Sidransky is eminently qualified to lead this program as aninternational leader in translational research, well versed in both clinical and basic career advancement.2. Describe any candidates that have already been selected for support under this program and the rationale for these selections (this cycle)PATRICK HA, M.D.Dr. Ha will start on his career development award and as an Assistant Professor of the Department ofOtolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery andOncology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine thissummer. His career goals stem from a desire to treat patients suffering from head and neck cancer by allmeans possible. Surgery is clearly one aspect of treatment, but he understands that we may have reached ourlimits of therapy by simple extirpation. Although a combination of medical and radiation treatment has greatlyexpanded treatment options and sometimes offers a better chance of survival with less functional morbidity,much remains to be done. As a young clinician-scientist, he is dedicated to not only treating patients in theoffice and operating room, but also to the laboratory. He intends to examine the basic biology of head andneck cancers including salivary gland tumors and make special efforts to understand the epigeneticprogression of these cancers. Form these studies he will identify cancer-specific promoter methylation eventsand generate new biomarkers of cancer. He will focus on translating these discoveries into efforts aimed at theearly detection, molecular progression, and targeted therapy of head and neck cancer.As a practicingsurgeon, he will play a unique role in these discoveries and possess the ability to implement these newtechniques into the care of his patients. He will be mentored by Drs Califano and Sidransky.Rationale: Talented surgeon with several years of molecular biology experience under Joseph Califano. A rarebreed that needs to be cultivated in this environment more than ever.Sara Isabel Pai, MDPhDDr. Pai is trained in Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery. She obtained doctoral training in tumorimmunology, molecular biology, gene therapy, and cancer vaccine development in the MD/PhD program at theJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her mentors were Drs. Drew Pardoll. T.-C. Wu, Robert Silicianoand David Sidransky. She also received fellowship training at the National Institutes of Health in the molecularbiology/immunology laboratory of Dr. Paul Plotz, Chief of Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch. During herPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 373 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/ProgramDirector (Last, First, Middle): Sidransky, David Career Developmentgraduate training, she was a principal investigator in a clinical trial evaluating HPV specific immunologicresponses in patients with HPV-associated pre-cancerous lesions within the cervix. She also worked with theRapid Access to Interventional Development (RAID) program of NCI in the development of the pNGVL4a-Sig/E7/LAMP-1 and pNGVL4a-E7/HSP70 DNA vaccines that are currently being used in several ongoingclinical trials at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Pai is a principal investigator in a clinical trial evaluating HPVspecific immunologic responses in HPV-associated head and neck cancers at the Greater Baltimore MedicalCenter. She is also a co-investigator in the HPV clinical trial in Project 3 of the previous Head and NeckSPORE program. She currently participates in the Clinical Trials Working Group at the Johns Hopkins Hospitalheaded by Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee. She will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Otolaryngology/Headand Neck Surgery and will be a co-principal investigator with Dr. T.-C. Wu in the HPV clinical trial in Project 3of the current SPORE application.Rationale: Practicing surgeon with a PhD in immunology under TC Wu and Drew Pardoll. Also a woman with astrong desire to compete and succeed. As above, a rare breed that needs to be cultivated in this environmentmore than ever.3. For competing renewal applications, list all of the individuals supported by this program during the past term of the grant, how the SPORE has contributed to their careers in translational research, and the process by which a career development project has been promoted or incorporated into the full translational research projects within the SPORE.Seven candidates have or will receive $44-50,000 awards from the Career Development Program since 2000.One of our Career Development awardees at Hopkins became the leader of a Research Project (Califano fromthe Lung SPORE), Two are CO-PIs of a SPORE clinical supplemental grant (Califano and Gibson), and onewas elevated to status of investigator in a Core (Xing). Elevation to the status of Research Project occurs whena budgetary opportunity occasions a solicitation for new Research Project(s) in the SPORE; thus, theawardee's proposal is required to out-compete all other alternative projects if it is to become a ResearchProject. In other words, a successful career development award can be a means to prepare an application forthe SPORE, and the Career Development Program remains keenly aware that a successful awardee can be auseful addition to the SPORE even beyond the award period.Chul-So Moon MD PhD received his career development award form 2002-2005. He is currently an AssistantProfessor in the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology at the Johns HopkinsSchool of Medicine. In 1991, he came to Johns Hopkins Medical School for the human genetics Ph.D.program. At Hopkins, he discovered the human AQP structural gene and stayed in Peter Agre's lab to furtherstudy gene expression regulation. After finishing his medicine training, he went to MD Anderson for aHematology-Oncology fellowship where he finished under the tutelage of Dr. W Hong and Dr. Li Mao. At theend of his fellowship training at MD Anderson, Dr. Moon was recruited to the Head and Neck Cancer ResearchCenter at the Johns Hopkins University Oncology Center where he is involved in the care of upper aero-digestive tract cancer patients. Presently, his research interests are focused on the biology and translationalapproaches for head and neck and lung cancer including functional studies on the aquaporins and the searchnew methylation markers in lung and head and neck cancers. He was recently mentored by Drs Agre andSidransky. His studies have been funded in part by a pilot grant form this SPORE and are the basis of an RO1submission on aquaporin biology.¿ Kim MS, Yamashita K. Baek JH, Park HL.

ReviewDr. Anthony Alberg PhD MPH received his career development award form 2002-2003. He is anepidemiologist in the Bloomberg School of public health with broad interests in cancer research at thecommunity level. On one hand, his research interests include the bridge between epidemiology and thebehavioral sciences for cancer prevention and control activities. Previous and current work in this regardincludes research concerning tobacco use, skin cancer prevention behaviors, and community cancer control.On the other hand, Dr. Alberg's work has also emphasized the bridge between epidemiology and thelaboratory, including etiologic research that incorporates the relationship between biomarkers (e.g., serummicronutrients, hormones, and tumor markers) and genetic polymorphisms in relation to cancer risk. Dr.Alberg wanted to focus his research on tobacco-associated cancers, primarily head/neck and lung cancer.The SPORE support offered him tremendous career development opportunities to engage in multidisciplinaryresearch devoted to better understanding the etiology of head and neck cancer and the development of earlydetection strategies. He continues to focus on population based studies predominantly in head and neck andlung cancer and remains a strong collaborator with Dr Califano in molecular etiology and detectionapproaches. He was mentored by Drs. Samet and Califano and is an NCI K07 awardee.¿ Masayesva BG, Mambo E. Taylor RJ. Goloubeva OG. Zhou S. Cohen Y. Minnas K. Koch W. Sciubba J. Alberq AJ. Sidranskv D.

He is currently a surgeon andAssistant Professor in the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology at the JohnsHopkins School of Medicine. After discovery of Braf mutations in thyroid cancer as part of this SPORE grant,his work focused on testing for the BRAF mutation in indeterminate thyroid fine needle aspirates as a meansfor directing extent of surgery. It involved a coordinated effort between radiology and cytopathology and strongcollaborations with Drs Xing and Umbricht. A designated study coordinator was responsible for setting upultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsies. A designated research assistant was responsible forcollecting specimens to be run for the BRAF assay in the CLIA approved cytopathology lab. The study beganaccruing patients since the beginning of March of 2004 and all endocrine physicians who treat thyroid diseaseand see these patients are participating. Five out of eight patients eligible for the study have elected toundergo this research protocol since its inception. It is expected to accrue approximately 50-75 patients thisyear with a final sample size of at least 125 to provide the power to assess the primary outcome variables.

Int J Cancer. 2006Christopher Umbricht, MD, PhD received his career development award from 2003 -2005. Originally fromCanada, he is currently a researcher in the department of Surgical Oncology at the Johns Hopkins School ofMedicine. His investigation delved into the epigenetic silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation inthyroid cancer. AS a collaborator with DrXing, he made significant progress in investigating the modulation ofgene expression profiles of thyroid cancer cell lines by pharmacological intervention and quantitative analysisof 11 gene methylation profiles in a large cohort of clinical thyroid tumors. After assessing the baseline statusof several tumor and differentiation markers by RT-PCR as well as methylation markers, he determined thedose-response characteristics of these cell lines to various combinations of demethylating agents such as 5-Azacytidine, ISA,and EGCG, the active component in green tea extract, with vitamins A, D, and E. Heperformed studies on clinical tissues using QMSP of RassflA, TSHR, RAR-beta2, DAPK, S100, p16, CDH1,CALCA, TIMP3, TGF-beta, and GSTpi in a cohort of 82 thyroid tumors and 5 thyroid cancer cell lines,Hypermethylation was found in cancers for the following markers: RassflA (15%), TSHR (33%), RAR-beta2(22%), CDH1 (22%), TIMP3 (22%), and TGF-beta (33%). Hypermethylation was also detected in adenomasfor TSHR (30%), DAPK (16%) and TGF-beta (29%). A trend toward multiple hypermethylation was evident incancer tissues, with hypermethylation of 2 or more markers detectable in 25% of hyperplasias, 38% ofadenomas, 48% of thyroid cancers, and 100% of cell lines. A rank correlation analysis of markerhypermethylation suggested that at least in thyroid tissue, a subset of these markers are epigeneticallymodified in concert, independent of histological tumor type, which may reflect an organ-specific regulationprocess.

He successfully competedfor R01 funding last year based on work generated in this SPORE. Following his Ph.D. training in Physiology &Biophysics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, and a research postdoctoral training atUniversity of California, San Diego, Dr. Xing completed his medical residency/endocrine fellowship training atGBMC/Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. He was recruited to the Division ofEndocrinology & Metabolism at Johns Hopkins University as an Assistant Professor in 2003 and promoted toAssociate Professor in 2006.

He is now Co-Investigator on project 5 which is direct result of his findings under this career development award. His overallresearch interest is to discover novel molecular mechanisms in tumor genesis and progression and to translatethem into clinical use in patients. He is particularly interested in the genetic, molecular, and cellularmechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, the most common endocrine malignancy Severalprojects in his laboratory involve efforts to elucidate the role of major genetic alterations, such as BRAFmutation, Ras mutation and RET/PTC rearrangements, and epigenetic alterations, such as gene methylationand chromatin/histone modifications in thyroid cancer. He remains particularly interested in the role of thesegenetic and epigenetic alterations in the regulation of various thyroid-specific genes, such as TSH receptor andiodide transporter genes as well as certain tumor suppressor genes in thyroid tumors. Efforts are being madeto identify the specific molecular events (potential therapeutic targets) involved in the connection between MAPkinase pathway activation and aberrant gene methylation and silencing, triggered by some of the geneticalterations. One important goal of these studies is to elucidate how these molecular events affect some of theunique functions of thyroid cancer with radioiodine. His mentors were Dr David Sidransky and Dr PaulLadenson. Dr. Xing is currently supported, as the PI, by a FAMRI grant, an American Cancer Society ResearchScholar Award, and a NIH RO-1 grant.¿ Xing M, Westra WH, Tufano RP, Cohen Y.

      "A fundamental problem in bone cell biology, is how bone-specific genes are rendered competent forexpression and steroid hormone responsiveness at appropriate stages during the osteoblast developmentalsequence. This program established that Runx2, the key transcription factor required for bone formation,plays a critical role in the assembly of active chromatin at the osteocalcin (OC)promoter during phenotypeprogression and is required for steroid hormone responsiveness. The long term goal of this project is tounderstand how dynamic reorganization of the chromatin of bone-specific genes at subnuclear focicontributes to activation of the osteoblast developmental transcription program in response to physiologicregulatory cues. Importantly, during the current award period, we have demonstrated that activity of theSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is also essential both for expression and vitamin D enhancement ofthe OC gene in osteoblastic cells and for osteoblast differentiation. We now propose to extend our excitingfindings to address the hypothesis that induction of the osteoblast phenotvpe must involve histonemodifications and ordered remodeling of chromatin in an osteoblast-specific manner in response to tissue-specific factors and multi-component enzymatic complexes that bind sequentially to activate and regulatetranscription and mediate vitamin D responsiveness. To understand more broadly how gene expression isregulated during skeletal development, we will pursue a highly collaborative approach to characterize: 1. theRunx2-dependent and vitamin D responsive program of binding events and chromatin remodeling at theosteocalcin promoter; 2. epigenetic marking and chromatin remodeling of bone phenotypic genes inresponse to Runx2 and vitamin D during osteoblast differentiation; and 3. the Runx2 and Vitamin Dresponsive gene expression program required for establishment and maintenance of the mature bone cellphenotype. These studies will reveal the role of Runx2 and key co-factors for developmental expression andvitamin D dependent regulation of genes required for osteoblast differentiation. Collaborations withProjects 1 and 2 will provide novel insights into the function of Runx2 in supporting local architecturalorganization of gene promoters and co-regulators for bone-specific transcriptional control.Clinical Relevance: Defining mechanisms that control chromatin organization is compelling for understandingactions and consequences of inhibitors that target chromatin for the treatment of diseases that affect boneturnover in the adult skeleton.University of Massachusetts Medical School55 Lake Avenue NorthWorcester, MA 01655PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 240 Form Page 2Project 3 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Stein, Gary S.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The goals of Project 3 are to develop and apply methods for expanding transplanted human cells in apediatric nonhuman primate model that can be readily monitored and tracked using in vivo imaging. Toincrease the quantity of cells available for transplant we will obtain hematopoietic cells differentiated fromhuman embryonic stem cells (hESC) that will be expanded by co-culture with human endothelial progenitorcells (EPC) based on protocols developed in Project 1. Transplant of early hematopoietic cells, rather thanmature cells, may be central to the success of cell-based therapies. To improve the levels of engraftmentand increase the quantity of cells post-transplant, we will transduce cells with a drug resistance gene.Therefore, one of the goals of these studies is to use differentiated hESC in a side-by-side comparison withadult human peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). These investigations will allow us to focus on methods toexpand stem and progenitor cells in infant monkeys which could have significant clinical utility. Thetransplant of cells differentiated from hESC in this pediatric nonhuman primate model will also addressconcerns related to the in vivo transplantation of these cells. In addition, our prior studies have shown thatwe can monitor gene expression in fetal and infant monkeys using reporter genes, microPET, and opticalimaging. Based on these findings we will use similar protocols to inject, image, and track transplantedhuman stem and progenitor cells expanded postnatally in this model. Preliminary studies have shown thatlabeling of cells with radioactive copper does not harm the cells and permits cell tracking for several days.While these studies provide a crucial step towards developing techniques for human cell trafficking, safe,sensitive, and efficient methods for monitoring cells longitudinally and over time that can be translated tohumans are needed. These investigations will allow us to focus on semi-quantitative methods for cellimaging, and the use of selection and in vivo imaging protocols simultaneously in infant nonhuman primates.If imaging technologies with sufficient sensitivity to detect small quantities of cells can be used, this wouldprovide a very powerful tool for assessing the safety and efficiency of cell-based therapies in humans.California National Primate Research Center, University of California, Davis CAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 166 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Tarantal, Alice F (Project 3)KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The long-term objectives of this project have been to investigate the roles of viral DMA replication,replication proteins that serve as targets for antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, and gene expression in theinteraction of herpes simplex virus (HSV) with the mammalian nervous system, especially virus latency.Latency is the most fascinating biological property of the virus and its most important clinical feature as itpermits the virus to remain in the host and subsequently reactivate to cause disease. Understanding HSVlatency is sure to reveal novel features of HSV and the nervous system. Such information is highly relevantto antiviral drugs that target DMA replication, vaccines, and potential agents to cure HSV infections. The proposed research will study the mechanisms by which acyclovir-resistant mutants retainpathogenicity, in particular the ability to reactivate from latency (aim 1). The relative contributions of lowthymidine kinase (TK) expression and reversion will be assessed in experiments in which acyclovir will beadministered to mice using implantable pumps during establishment of latency. Bacterial artificialchromosome methods will be used to map alleles of clinical isolates that compensate for loss of TK inreactivation. How viral gene expression is regulated during latency will be explored (aim 2). Quantitativereverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays will be used to measure expression ofdifferent classes of transcripts during latency and reactivation. Knock-out mice will be used to test thehypothesis that immune effectors such as inteferon y repress the expression of viral genes. Why latetranscripts accumulate during reactivation in the presence of acyclovir will be explored. A third set of studieswill investigate whether the latency-associated transcript (LAT) locus represses viral gene expressionthrough short intefering RNAs and microRNAs that can be expressed from this locus. The presence of theseRNAs will be assayed in latently infected ganglia and, in collaboration with project 1, chromatin. Mutantviruses will be constructed to test the importance of these mechanisms for repression. Changes in hostgene expression, which may affect latency, will also be investigated (aim 3). Array technologies, RT-PCR,and knockout mice will be used to identify whether observed changes in host gene expression are due toimmune effectors such as interferon y. Viral mutants will be used to examine the role of viral factors (e.g.microRNAs) in these changes. The proposed experiments should shed light on viral and cellular factorsinvolved in the establishment, maintenance, and reactivation of HSV latency. Latency is why herpesviruses cause diseases for which there are no cures. Understanding how latency isestablished, maintained, and reactivated could lead to a cure for HSV.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MAPHS 398(Rev. 09/04) Page Form Page 2000135Project 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Schaffei , Priscilla A.KEY PERSONNEL.

Specific Aims The long-term objectives of this project have been to investigate the roles of viral DNA replication andreplication proteins (especially those that serve as targets for antiviral drugs), and gene expression in theinteraction of herpes simplex virus (HSV) with the mammalian nervous system. These studies haveimplications for the biology of the virus and the nervous system, and for antiviral drugs and drug resistance.The goals are a subset of the overall goal of the program, which is to identify viral and cellular factors involvedin the establishment/maintenance, and reactivation of HSV latency. The studies are very much incollaboration with the other members of the program. During the previous grant period, studies of thymidine kinase (tk) mutations that cause acyclovir-resistance(ACVr) in drug-resistant clinical isolates, have illuminated three different general ways by which the virus mayevade drug therapy, yet retain pathogenicity. Studies detecting and quantifying HSV transcripts have raisedthe possibility of a specific block in late gene expression during latency, and revealed unexpected behaviors oflate gene transcripts during reactivation. Other results from these studies and our recent detection of HSV-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs), have suggested mechanisms for how the latency-associated transcript (LAT)locus mediates repression during latency. Studies using array technology have revealed specific changes inneuronal gene expression in latently infected ganglia. These previous studies provide the basis for the currentproposal whose specific aims are:1. To study how ACV tk mutants from clinical isolates retain pathogenicity, focusing on the interplay of lowlevel TK activity with reversion of frameshift mutations, and on alleles in genes other than tk that permitreactivation from latency in the absence of TK.2. To investigate regulation of viral gene expression during HSV latency in mice, in particular to investigateregulation of late gene expression during latency and reactivation, and how repression may be mediated by theLAT locus and by immune effectors such as interferon (IFN) y.3. To study changes in host gene expression during HSV latency in mice and how host and viral factors effectthese changes.B. Background and Significance. The interaction of HSV with the mammalian nervous system that results in virus latency is the mostfascinating biological property of the virus and its most important clinical feature. How does a virus that is soaccomplished at productive infections completely alter its program of gene expression and replication toestablish a silent, yet reactivatable infection of a neuron? Answering this question seems certain to uncovernovel aspects of HSV and the nervous system. Such information is highly relevant to strategies to prevent andtreat HSV infections and might even lead to agents to cure HSV infections. Moreover, studies of virus mutantswith alterations in TK not only shed light on latency, but on mechanisms of gene expression and, because TKis a drug target, have implications for the use of antiviral drugs. Background information relevant to thisproposal will now be reviewed:1. HSV productive cycle ( lytic ) gene expression. HSV is a large, enveloped virus containing a -150 kbplinear genome whose sequence predicts -70 protein coding genes (84). After entry of HSV DNA into thenucleus of cultured cells, a cascade of gene expression ensues [unless otherwise cited, see (97)].Transcription of the first class of genes to be expressed (immediate early, IE, a) is stimulated by a virioncomponent, VP16, and does not require prior viral protein synthesis. IE gene products include ICP 4, 27, 0,and 22, which are regulators of gene expression, and ICP47, which antagonizes antigen presentation. ICP4and 27 are essential for viral replication. ICPO, ICP22, and ICP47 are non-essential. However, ICPO isespecially important at low multiplicities of infection in resting cells and ICP22 is more important in some celltypes than in others. The subsequent two classes of genes to be expressed are termed early (E, (3) and late(L, Y),respectively, based on when in the infectious cycle their expression peaks. E genes mainly encodeproteins involved in DNA replication. These include enzymes that directly participate in DNA synthesis and arePHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04) Page Continuation Format Page000137\n",

      "CP1.  Administrative Core Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Schneewind, OlafPI, Olaf Schneewind, University of ChicagoThe organizational plan of the Midwestem RCE is designed to achieve multiple scientific objectives bymarshalling the resources of its diverse Region V participants. These participants include universities, anational laboratory, corporations, hospitals, and Regional or National Biocontainment Laboratories. TheMidwestem RCE Administrative Core (AC) is designed to: maintain scientifically objective and bias-freedirection and coordination of the projects; enable RCE management to identify opportunities and to attractintellectual or infrastructural resources (whether within the Midwestem RCE or elsewhere); recruitqualified women and minorities into biodefense research; create an open and flexible environment torespond quickly to new developments within Region V, other regions, and elsewhere; monitor progress ofall Midwestern RCE activities toward their goals; provide quick review of proposals in order to attract highqualitysubmissions; and remain responsive to the needs of all its constituencies, ranging from basicresearch, to medical research, to corporations, to first responders. The organization of the AC linkspharmaceutical and biotech companies with federal, state, and local agencies, as well as otherinvestigators, to foster translational research and promote maximal use of the core facilities. In the caseof a biodefense emergency, the Midwestem RCE will rapidly realign its activities and resources to assistlocal or national response efforts. In so doing, it will maintain fluent communications with its participantsand their respective communities. The Midwestem RCE has already defined (and published on itswebsite) mechanisms for monitoring and self-evaluation of its research activities, as well as identifyingand responding to new opportunities. The committee-based management scheme of the MidwesternRCE, and its web- based collaboration tools, will ensure information flow from top to bottom and viceversa.The Administrative Core is designed to assure the financial and administrative integrity of the MidwestemRCE. The AC has been operational since August 2002, when the University of Chicago emerged as thePI institution of the Midwestem RCE. The proposed structure of the AC is shown in the Organization Chart(Figure 1 below). The AC is responsible for the general administration and coordination of researchactivities across the departments, programs, and schools of the participating universities of federallydesignatedRegion V. The core is accountable for planning and priority setting for all researchers in thecenter; it works towards this goal by conducting ongoing assessments to identify needs and opportunitiesand seeking routine advice from oversight committees inside and outside the center. The AC creates anintegrated work environment that functionally links basic and clinical researchers from different disciplinesto each other and to key resources and new technologies. Through support of its research programs, thecore will expand the capacity of scientists to work together in newly developing areas of biodefenseresearch. The goal for the AC is to sustain a research framework to stimulate and support scientificdiscovery and its clinical application to the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.The specific aims are to:provide leadership in setting research goals for the center;develop and implement strategies for achieving the center's research, education, humanresource/diversity, and emergency response goals;¿ foster the universities' commitment to biodefense research and emergency response;¿ capitalize on the interdisciplinary strength of the center investigators to expand the researchportfolio;¿ sustain a basic and clinical research infrastructure for enhanced collaboration, advancedtechnology support, emergency response, and access to key resources; and¿ ensure that the research infrastructure is robust and responsive to the expanding and everchangingneeds of center investigators.The Administrative Core supports the members of the Midwestem RCE by providing a centralizedgoverning organization to ensure the intelligent use of resources to meet the center's goals for research,service and education. In this way, the AC is responsible for an organizational plan that helps realize themultiple scientific goals of the Midwestem RCE. This organizational plan will facilitate the MidwestemRCE to overcome typical obstacles associated with modern scientific research, including distancebetween collaborators, scarcity of available facilities and institutional delays. From the beginning, theoverarching vision of the consortium has been to weave together the superb existing resources of RegionV, building momentum to accommodate and utilize the support of a Regional Center of Excellence in theAutumn of 2003. For the last year, the backbone of the consortium has been its rapid and fluentcommunication with scientists and institutions in Region V and beyond. Over the next years, theconsortium intends to bring this proficiency in administration to its associations with the NIH/NIAID and thegeneral public as the federally-sponsored Midwestem RCE. The Biological Sciences Division (BSD) at theUniversity of Chicago has provided substantial support for the Administrative Core and will continue toprovide ongoing support for the AC. In particular, the BSD will provide ongoing support for half-timesalary support for the Grant Administrator and office student support, supplies and services, researchdevelopment/program activities, staff development, and telephone and network costs. In addition, theBSD will provide dedicated space for the AC and state-of-the-art teleconferencing/video conferencingcapabilities. The fiscal 2004 BSD contribution to the AC will be approximately $400,000The staff of the Administrative Core (and the responsibilities of the AC) have steadily grown, along withthe consortium itself. The current and proposed AC is comprised of eight staff members (four of whom arefull-time), each charged with distinct duties integral to the successful administration of the MidwestemRCE. The specific duties assigned to each AC staff member represents a prioritization of the center'smany and diverse activities. Each AC member is committed to supporting the Midwestem RCE's fulltransition from a spirited consortium to a federally-funded center. All Midwestem RCE participants areeligible to use the resources of the AC. If future demand for services exceeds available staff time, theDirector will establish priorities based on the needs of the center.\n",

      "by Dia-Sorin. The assay begins with samples (zero and incubated)and standards being incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in antibody coated tubes with I125 tracer added.After removing the elluent, antibody coated tubes are counted in a gamma counter and sample valuesobtained by comparing those of samples to those of the standard curve. The zero sample is then subtractedfrom the incubated sample to determine the amount of angiotensin I generated (Figsl ,2)(3,4). In mice, due toPHS 398/2590 (Rev.09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 315 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Romero,J.Carlos): Romero, J. Carlos COTG Cproblems with measuring PRA, we will instead measure PRC. Briefly for PRC generation we will use themethods of Carretero and Beierwaltes (5,6). This involves incubating our mouse samples for 2 hours at 37 ¿Cwith nephrectomized rat substrate in the presence of a peptidase inhibitor. To terminate the reaction, samplesare boiled for 10 minutes then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm's. The supernatant is then removed andstored at -20 ¿C until assayed using the same kit as used for PRA measurement (Dia-Sorin). Anaiotensin II plasma and tissue: To extract Ang II from the tissue, we will first smash the tissue at-80'|0C, then homogenize in cold MeOH. Samples are then centrifuged at 20,000 G's, the MeOH supernatantsample removed, lyophilized, and stored at -80¿C until reconstituted into assay buffer for extraction.Reconstituted tissue samples and plasma sampleswill use the same methods for extraction and assaying.Basically samples will be extracted on a pre-washed phenyl extraction column washed with dH2O and elutedwith MeOH. The MeOH is removed by lyophilization and the samples reconstituted in assay buffer. TheEnzyme Immunoassay (EIA) kit used is provided by SPI-Bio and distributed by Cayman Chemical. It involvesan incubation of sample and standard with a monoclonal antibody immobilized to the wells of a 96 well plate.After immunological reaction the wells are washed and the trapped ANG II molecule is covalently linked backto the antibody complex with gluteraldehyde. After washing and denaturing the bound ANG II can react withthe acetylcholinerase-labelled antibody (tracer). After washing to remove unbound tracer, the tracer bound tothe ANG II complex reacts with Ellman's reagent to slowly develop a yellow color that is read on aspectrophotometer plate reader at the wavelength of 405 nm. Readings of samples are compared to those ofstandards to obtain a value. This value is given as pg per mg protein for the tissue samples and pg/ml for theplasma samples. This assay exhibits a 2-7% intra- and inter-assay coefficient when measuring from 20-100 pgof Ang ll/ml and 2-5% variation when estimating 2-5 pg of Ang II (Fig 2) (4,7,8,9). Nitrotvrosine - tissue: The principle of this assay is based on the fact that NO is the only biologicalmolecule produced in high enough concentration to out-compete SODfor superoxides to form ~OONO. Thiscompound modifies tyrosine in proteins to create nitrotyrosines leaving a marker detectable in vivo.Monoclonal antibodies to nitrotyrosine can then be used to determine immunohistochemically the~OONO-dependent tyrosine nitration. Kidney tissue froze in liquid nitrogen will be homogenized in 20 mM Hepes, pH7.5, containing protease inhibitors, and will be centrifuged 600 xg to remove cellular debris. Gelelectrophoresis analyses for nitrotyrosine residues will be performed on the supernatant as previouslydescribed using the anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Cayman,Ann Arbor) as the primary antibody.Following size separation and electrophoretic transfer of kidney proteins to nitrocellulose, Western blot willbe performed as described by the vendor for the ECL plus kit (Amersham)for chemiluminescent detection.Bands on exposed films will be quantitated by densitometry. Nitrotyrosine from the vendor will be used as apositive control and GAPDH will be used as the loading control (10). Isoprostane (ISOP)- plasma and tissue: We will measure in plasma samples free levels of ISOP andin tissue samples total levels of ISOP using an enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA, Cayman). Basically allsamples are thawed on ice prior to extraction, to reduce the likelihood of further production of ISOP. Tissuesamples must first be homogenized in assay buffer with a polytron homogenizer, then undergo an alkalinehydrolysis with 15% potassium hydroxide to release the lipoprotein bound ISOP. Samples are then dilutedwith absolute ethanol (2X) and centrifuged to remove the precipitate. All samples are then diluted withdistilled water, pHed to 3.0 with 1.0 HCI, and added to a Sep Pak C-18 extraction column (Milford, MA).Here they are washed first with distilled water and then Hexane, and eluted off the column with 99/1% EthylAcetate/Methanol. The organic solvent is evaporatedfrom the sample, which is reconstituted in assaybuffer. For the assay, samples, tracer, and antiserum are added to wells pre-coated with mouse monoclonalsecondary antibody and incubated overnight at room temperature. After incubation, plates are washed toremove all unbound ISOP and Ellman's Reagent (containing the substrate to acetylcholinesterase) is addedto the wells. Absorbencies produced by this enzymatic reaction will be determined using aspectrophotometer set at 405nm and sample readings will be compared to the standards to obtain values(Fig.3) (4,8,11). Total Anti-oxidant Capacity - plasma This is afast andeasy assayfor measuring the combined actionsof all antioxidants in biological fluids and there ability to reduce reactive oxygen species. The assay (AOP-490,Oxis Research) is based on the capacity of the antioxidants in the sample to reduce copper++ to copper +.Basically samples and standards are diluted 1:40 with Bathocuproine Reagent (combines with Copper + toform a compound that absorbs at 490 nm) then added to a microplate with baseline absorbance read at 490nm. A copper ++ reagent is next added to the samples and standards and jncubated for 3 minutes.

Carlos COFG Cabsorbencies are read at 490mn and net absorbance is recorded. Sample absorbencies are then compared tothose of standards with known quantities of uric acid to obtain Total Antioxidant Capacity for each sample. NADPH-oxidase (p47) - tissue NADPH (p47) is assayed using the western blot analysis. Brieflytissue samples are smashed at -80¿C and homogenized in lysis buffer. The homogenates are thencentrifuged and supernatant removed. For the western blot, 50 ug sample supernatant (as determined byLowry protein analysis) is loaded onto a 12.5 % Tris-HCI gel, then transferred to a PVDF membrane.Membranes are then blocked with 5 % milk in TBS-T and incubated overnight at 4¿C with primary p47-NADPHantibody (1:1000) (Cell Signalling). The next day membranes are incubated for 2 hours at room temperaturewith secondary (goat anti-rabbit) antibody (1:1000), fluoresced with ECL solution and intensities of the bandsrecorded on x-ray film. Finally membranes are stripped with guanidine hydrochloride solution, blocked with a5% milk solution and incubated with B-actin antibody. Upon completion of all western analysis, intensities ofp47 NADPH bands are quantified and values are computed relative to the intensities of B-actin(12). GSH/GSSG Assay - tissue (OXIS International. CA) Tissue samples are homogenized in lysis bufferadded with 20 ul 1-Methy-2-vinyl-pyridium trifluoromethane sulfonate (M2VP), a thiol-scavenging reagentwhich rapidly scavenges GSH but does not interfere with glutathione reductase, since GSH oxidation likelyoccurs rapidly in disrupted tissues. Samples are vortexed with 5% metaphosphoric acid for 20 sec, and thenadded with assay buffer or GSSG buffer for final measurement. At the time of measurement, 200 pi ofstandards, blank or samples are added into the cuvettes, mixed with 200 ul Chromogen and 200ul glutathionereductase at room temperature for 5 min. 200 ul of NADPH is added to each cuvettes, the change ofabsorbance at 412nm recorded for 3 min. A six-point standard curve is constructed, and GSH or GSSGconcentration, GSH/GSSG ratio was calculated following the instructions. DHE. In situ production of super oxide anion is measuredin 30-um frozen kidney sections using theoxidative fluorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE). Cytosolic DHE exhibits blue fluorescence, but once oxidizedby super oxide to ethidium bromide it intercalates within the cell's DNA, staining its nucleus a fluorescent red(excitation at 488 nm, emission 610 nm). Serial sections areequilibrated under identical conditions for 30 minat 37¿C in Krebs-HEPES buffer. Then, fresh buffer containing DHE (2 umol/l) is applied to each tissue section,cover slips added, and tissues incubatedfor 30 min in a light-protected humidified chamber at 37¿C.Quantification of each tissue section for levels of DHE is evaluated using fluorescence microscopy (13). Creatinine will be determined in plasma and urine by means of the Jaffe rate method. Sodium/Potassium will be measured in plasma and urine by flame photometry.StatisticalAnalysis Results will be shown as mean ¿ SEM. Comparisonswithin groups will be performed by use of pairedStudent's t test, and among groups by ANOVA, with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons,followed by unpaired Student's t test.Literature cited1.

      "This subproject is one of many research subprojects utilizing theresources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR. The subproject andinvestigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source,and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed isfor the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator.The RCMI Program at The University of Texas at San Antonio continues to enhance the neuroscience and proteomics capacities in South Texas.  Changes in the organizational structure of the RCMI Program began in March of 2005 when Dr. Matthew Gdovin was named the Interim Program Director and continued to evolve to include the appointment of a new Principal Investigator, Dr. Robert Gracy, Vice President for Research.  Dr. Gdovin began to immediately address all concerns, suggestions, and criticisms in the NIH Summary Statement.  The culmination of progress of the RCMI Program at UTSA was documented in an Administrative Report submitted to NCRR prior to the December 4, 2006 NIH Administrative site visit at UTSA.  The subsequent report by NIH following the site visit was very positive regarding the changes that the RCMI Program instituted in response to the NIH Summary Statement and the scientific progress of the RCMI Program at UTSA.OverviewUTSA is now second only to the Austin campus in student enrollment (over 28,500). Research growth in the past year was 37% over the previous year and UTSA now ranks third in research of all the UT System Universities. The UTSA this year launched a strategic plan for becoming a premier research university. The goal of this strategic plan is to become nationally ranked as a premier research institute. To that end, major administrative changes have already taken place. The University hired its first Vice President for Research (Dr. Robert Gracy) and major infrastructure upgrades are underway. Already, a new Biotechnology Science & Engineering building (230,000 sq. ft.) has been opened and Science and Engineering building (190,000 sq. ft.) is scheduled for groundbreaking in early 2007. A Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) and a full time veterinarian/laboratory animal staff are committed to achieving AAALAC accreditation.  A new Technology Transfer Office has been added in collaboration with the University of Texas Health Science Center, and an Assistant VP for Technology Transfer and Commercial Ventures is currently being sought.  New faculty continue to be hired at a record pace (up to 50 per year) and other new administrators (e.g. new Deans for the College of Sciences, Engineering, and Provost) have been added in the past 6 months.This research growth is taking place while UTSA continues to build its leadership in minority education. Currently, 60% of our students are composed of minorities (44% Hispanic; 7% African American; 6% Asian and 3% International). UTSA ranks third in the number of undergraduates degrees awarded to Hispanic students and ranks 1st in number of biological science degrees awarded for 9 of the past 10 years. The RCMI program is a critical element in these achievements. UTSA has made major changes and renewed commitments to management of the RCMI program.  UTSA administrators have frequently met with NIH NCRR to restructure the RCMI program.RCMI Organizational StructureThe organizational structure of the RCMI Program at UTSA consists of Administrative and Scientific divisions.  The Administrative division includes the Principle Investigator, the Program Director, Program Manager, and an Institutional Administrative Support Team.  The Scientific division includes the External and Internal Advisory Committees, Scientific Advisor, Core Leaders and Research Project PI's.   Formative and summative evaluations of both the administrative and scientific progress of the RCMI program at UTSA are provided to the PI by an external evaluator.  Table 1 illustrates the Organizational chart for the RCMI program at UTSA.\n",

      "The broad, long-term objectives of this proposal are to evaluate the global potential of amino acid transporterATB¿/ASCT2 as a selective therapeutic target in human hepatocellular carcinoma {HCC) and to elucidate thesignaling mechanisms linking it to liver cancer cell growth and survival. Currently, there are no effective therapiesfor this cancer and its incidence continues to rise in the United States. ASCT2 is expressed in all human livercancers examined to date, but is not expressed in normal human hepatocytes. Suppression of ASCT2expression by inducible antisense RNA in the SK-Hep HCC cell line leads to cell death by the intrinsic apoptoticpathway via a mechanism that is attenuated by osmotic cell swelling. Therefore, the working hypothesis is thatASCT2, via its role in substrate delivery and cellular hydration (swelling) is linked to mammalian target ofrapamycin (mTOR)- and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)- dependent survival signaling pathways,respectively, that impinge upon proteins responsible for apoptotic suppression in all human liver cancer ceils.The aims of this proposal thus arddress the universality and mechanisms linking ASCT2 to hepatoma survival:Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of ASCT2 post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) on the growth andviability of six human hepatoma cell lines, representing a broad spectrum of differentiated phenotypes.Research Plan: Several individual candidate small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to ASCT2 will be transfectedinto all six human hepatoma cell lines, and assessed for effects on growth, viability, ASCT2 expression andcaspase activation, compared to appropriate control siRNA. Subsequently, adenoviral DMA vectors encoding forcontrol and effective siRNA's (ideally 3) will be constructed and employed in signaling experiments. Off-targetsiRNA effects in ASCT2 silenced cells will be assessed by examination of a select panel of mRNA, microarrayanalysis and by the ability of reintroduced ASCT2 to  rescue  them. Alternative/corroborative approaches includeuse of PTGS methods such as morpholino antisense oligonucleotides or an inducible antisense RNA system.Specific Aim 2: To elucidate the signaling pathways linking ASCT2 silencing to hepatoma apoptosis.Research Plan: Signaling via PI3K-linked (PKB/Akt) and amino acid-dependent (mTOR) pathways as they relateto the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad, or other  mitochondrial gatekeepers , will be investigated pre- andpost-ASCT2 silencing through the use of selective biochemical inhibitors and western blot analyses. Putative linksestablished through this approach will be later confirmed by the expression of dominant negative or constitutivelyactive variants of Akt or other signaling proteins. The impact of ASCT2 silencing on cell volume will be assessedby flow cytometry analysis, and reciprocally, the ability of artificial cell swelling and shrinkage to modulate thesesignaling pathways will also be investigated to better understand the mechanistic link between amino acidtransoorter function and cancer cell survival.

State the application's broad, long-term objectives and specific aims, making reference to the health relatedness ofthe project (i.e., relevance to the mission of the agency).  Describe concisely the research design and methods for achieving these goals. Describethe rationale and techniques you will use to pursue these goals.In addition, in two or three sentences,  describe in plain, lay language the relevance of this research to public health. If the application is funded, thisdescription, as is, will become public information. Therefore, do not include proprietary/confidential information.  DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACEPROVIDED.Consumers' knowledge, values, and preferences are being recognized as drivers of health care utilization.With the therapeutic advances in the last decades, there are usually multiple options for a given clinicalproblem with different risk-benefit ratios; yet, patients spend less and less time with their physicians, andoften get information from alternate sources, such as the media or direct-to-consumer advertising.  Wepropose the creation of a comprehensive interdisciplinary Patient Awareness and Consumer EducationResearch Center with an overarching vision of supporting and empowering consumers of healthcare throughinformed decision-making. The mission of the RC will be to develop a program of excellence to improveconsumers' awareness of the benefits and risks of therapeutics through research, education, anddissemination, targeting consumers and their providers. Our strategic plan for the next five years has thefollowing specific aims:Aim 1  To establish the infrastructure for an interdisciplinary RC of excellence to conduct and supportresearch and educational initiatives related to health communication for patients and consumers.Aim 2  To develop a comprehensive research program to evaluate methods, application and outcomes ofhealth communication strategies. This aim will be achieved by:  (i) Developing the methodologicalinfrastructure to support investigator-initiated efforts in these areas (e.g. assistancewith grant proposals,collaborative efforts, contribution of resources);  (ii) Conducting four demonstration projectsAim 3  To establish a Consumer Health Advisory Information Network (CHAIN) to deploy a system for rapidresponse to emerging therapeutic issues.Aim 4  To disseminate and implement the information developed by the RC.These operationalaims will be achieved through the creation of three cores within the RC: (i) Research andTraining Core; (ii) Methods Core; and (iii) Education and Dissemination Core (including CHAIN).We have identified four major themes which will guide our strategic research, education and disseminationplan: (i) Health communication  and consumer education;  (ii)Clinician-patient interactions; (iii) Healthdecision-making; and (iv) Patient adherence to therapeutic recommendations.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Michael E.

      "Although the President's Commission identified schools as promising sites for early intervention with children manifesting aggressive behavior problems, the available evidence-based violence prevention programs (EBPs) are not readily adopted by schools. It is critical that we work in partnership with schools and school districts to bridge the gap between efficacy and effectiveness research by facilitating the process of EBP implementation and optimizing their impact in real world settings. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will enable Dr. Catherine Bradshaw, a developmental psychologist, to design and conduct research that will increase the use and effectiveness of school-based violence prevention programs. The training takes place within a robust research environment that utilizes resources from 2 federally funded research centers, the CDC-funded Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence, directed by Dr. Philip Leaf, and the NIMH/NI DA funded Center for Prevention and Early Intervention, directed by Dr. Nicholas lalongo. The proposed training focuses on: 1) Developing skills and expertise in the design, implementation, and analysis of school-based violence prevention trials; 2) Applying formal decision-making models to the selection and implementation of EBPs to prevent youth violence. Drs. Leaf and lalongo will provide mentorship on youth violence and school-based prevention trials, Dr. David Murray will provide training on the design and analysis of group-randomized trials, and Dr. Harold Lehmann will provide training on informatics and decision support. The research plan builds on a CDC/NIMH-funded group-randomized trial of the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) school-wide universal prevention model and a state-wide network of over 600 schools implementing PBIS to: 1) Create a web-based risk and protective factors screening instrument to guide an adaptive preventive intervention for children with aggressive behavior problems not responding to the universal PBIS program; 2) Implement and pilot a school-based adaptive preventive intervention for children with aggressive behavior problems. The objective of this research is to prevent youth violence by increasing dissemination and optimizing the effectiveness of school-based violence prevention programs. This award will prepare the PI for a career as an independent researcher focused on the implementation and effectiveness of school-based violence prevention programs.

      "The proposal aims at addressing the burden of disease, risk factorsfor and potential to intervene against neonatal and maternalperi-partum sepsis in a developingcountry setting with a high prevalence(29%)of maternal HIV infection. The study site is a secondary-tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. The primary aim of this proposal is to complete a currently underwaydouble-blind randomizedplacebo controlled trial studying the efficacy of chlorhexidine (0.5% solution) intavaginal washes during labor in the mother and subsequentcleansing of the newborn with full-body chlorhexidine wipes, to prevent early -onset (within 72 hours of birth) neonatal sepsis and peri-partum (within 14 days of birth) sepsis in the mother. Based on an estimatedincidence rate of 30 cases of sepsis/1000 life births occuring within 72 hours of birth, we proposeto randomise 8 000 women during labor into one of two arms (chlorhexidine vs. autoclaved tap- water inetnmittent vaginal washes) to detect at least a 40% reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis, with 80% power and 95% confidence. The study-outcome measureof neonatalsepsiswill include culture confirmed disease and/or a clinical diagnosis of sepsis based on an algorithm that has been agreed upon by experts in the field. We also plan to measure in a subset of mother-infant pairs the prevalence of vaginal colonisation by bacteria in the mother during labor and the impact of the study-intervention on the incidence of colonisation of the newborn with vaginal bacterial flora. The study will evaluate the effect of the intervention on the incidence of the following specificoutcomes: Primary objectives: 1. Early (within 72 hours of birth) microbiologiocally confirmed and/ or clinically diagnosed neonatalsepsis. 2. Decrease in vertical transmission of colonization with Group B Streptococcus from the mother to the newborn. Secondary objectives: 1. Incidence of community-acquired neonatal sepsis/meningitis between72 hours and 28 days of life. 2. Incidence of peripartum culture-confirmedor clinically diagnosed maternal sepsis within 14 days fo birth. 3. Incidence of colonization of the newbornwith Klebsiela pneumoniaeand E . coli. 4. The burden of disease and risk factors for maternal peripartum infection and serious neonatal infections in SouthAfrica with emphasis on the impact of maternalHIV infection on these outcomeswill also be studied. Relevance: The findings from this study may contribute in sari to realising one of the Millenium goals of the United Nations; i.e. to halve childhood mortality by2015.The leading cause of neonatal deaths, which contribute to at least one-third of all infant deaths, in developingcountries are sepsis and birth asphyxia. Logistical and resource constraints in developing countries prohibitthe implementation of strategies that have been successfully in developed countries to reduce neonatalsepsis, therefore a more practical and affordable solution is required for developing countries. PERFORMANCE S(TE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Witwatersrand/Medical Research Council Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens ResearchUnitChris Hani Baragwananth Hospital, Old Potch Road, Soweto, Gauteng, South AfricaThe study is to be done in Soweto, which is situated in central South Africa in a province called Gauteng.This is an urban African township with an estimated population of 1.2-1.5 million people in an area of 78square kilometers. Soweto is the largest Arican township in South Africa and has 29 districts withapproxiamtely 50-300 000 people residing in each district. Most residents reside in a variety of dwellingsranging from single sex hostels and informal shack settlements (26%) to formal brick housing (58%).Residents in Soweto have access to potable water in their yards (59%), or homes (35%), or community taps(6%). One in 10 adults in Soweto has no formal education and a quarter have a maximum of seven years ofeducation. Nearly 42% of adult Sowetans are unemployed. The community has been highly affected by HIV,with 30% of pregnant women that attend antenatal clinics testing positive for HIV. Annually there are 30000births in the area, with at least 18 000 of these occuring at the only public hospital in the area, viz. Chri Hani-Baragwanath hsoprtal (CHBH). Over 90% of expectant mothers have at least one antenatal visit prior todelivering, of whom more than 95% consnet to HIVtesting.

State the application's broad, long-term objectives and specific aims, making reference to the health relatedness of the project (i.e., relevance to the mission of the agency). Describe concisely the research design and methods for achieving these goals. Describe the rationale and techniques you will use to pursue these goals. In addition, in two or three sentences, describe in plain, lay language the relevance of this research to public health. If the application is funded, this description, as is, will become public information. Therefore, do not include proprietary/confidential information. DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACE PROVIDED.Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen of tuberculosis (TB), has a cell envelope with chemically complex lipids that are closely related with its virulence and multi-drug resistance. Acyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) provides the building blocks for these complex lipids, and the importance and validity of ACCase as a drug target is well recognized. The M. tuberculosis ACCase include six ACCase subunits (accD1-6), and that AccD4, AccD5 and AccD6 play major roles in providing the building-blocks to cell wall lipid biosyntheses. However, very little is known about the substrate specificity or biological functions of these pathogen ACCases. Our long-term goal is to discover a library of novel anti-TB therapeutics against new M. tuberculosis protein targets. The objective of this particular application is to elucidate the substrate specificities, sequence-structure-function relationship, and biological roles of AccD4, AccD5 and AccD6, using X-ray crystallography, enzyme inhibition assays, and computer-assisted inhibitor design. The rationale is that, once we identified inhibitors of AccD4-6, we will be able to inhibit cell wall lipid biosynthesis, leading to pathogen death. This rationale has been validated by past genetic data, which indicate that mutations of AccD4 and AccD6 lead to pathogen death. In the next two years, we will persue three aims: AIM 1. Determine the molecular basis of substrate specificities in AccD4-6: (1.1) Refine the co-crystal structures of AccD5 bound with propionyl-CoA and biotin analogs. (1.2) Refine the co-crystal structures of AccD6 bound with acetyl-CoA and biotin analogs. (1.3) Solve the crystal structure of apo AccD4, and cocrystal structures of AccD4 bound with long chain acyl-CoA and biotin analogs. AIM 2. Determine the inhibitor-binding specificities of AccD5-6: (2.1). Screen in silico Sulfa, Propeller and andrimid (three identified inhibitors) analogs against AccD5-6 using UC Irvine's ChemDB and cross-validation with two docking softwares. (2.2) Screen in vitro the inhibitors predicted from 2.1 and elucidate the AccD5-6 enzyme mechanisms by inhibition kinetics. (2.3) Refine co-crystal structures of AccD5-6 bound with Sulfa, Propeller or andrimid. AIM 3. Compare the active site geometries and substrate binding pockets of AccD4, AccD5 and AccD6, and define the substrate/inhibitor binding residues by site-directed mutagenesis: (3.1) Systematically mutate AccD5 residue 437 to evaluate its importance for substrate specificity. (3.2) Mutate residues in the Acyl-CoA binding pocket to probe for AccD5 specificities for acyl-CoA and Sulfa analogs. The feasibility of the proposed studies are strongly supported by strong preliminary data, including diffracting crystals of all proposed structural studies (AIM 1 and AIM 2.3), as well as established enzyme assays, identification of more than 50 potent inhibitors in AIM 2, and complete construction of half mutants proposed in AIM 3. The proposed research is scientifically significant because, for the first time, the substrate/inhibitor specificities of these unique M. tuberculosis ACCases will be critically evaluated and dissected. Such findings are original, because no ACCase from any other organisms has such a uniquely diverse, yet precisely controlled substrate specificity. The outcome from this proposal will identify potent ACCase inhibitors. Therefore, the completion of this project will also have health significance on the development of new TB therapeutics. The proposed research will retain and increase job opportunities for two graduate students and two postdoctoral researcher, and the outcome will enable us to provide new building blocks for downstream polyketide biosynthesis in an one-pot, environmentally friendly fashion that completes multi-step total syntheses by turning the bacteria into drug-manufacturing factory.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA REVISED ABSTRACT SECTION\n",

      "Type-1 diabetes (T1D) is hallmarked by autoimmune attack on the insulin-producing p cells of the pancreaticslets. Infiltration of the islets by autoimmune/inflammatory cells, or insulitis, occurs in a percentage of geneticallysusceptible individuals, and a fraction of these subjects progress to clinically overt diabetes. Our view of T1Dpathogenesis, especially in humans, remains clouded and controversial in many regards. The main reasons for:his unsatisfying picture are the complexity and heterogeneity of T1D, and the fact that it is not usually diagnoseduntil very late, when most initiating and propagating autoimmune phenomena have already played out. Oneapproach to surmounting the latter problem would be to develop a method to non-invasively image the pancreaticslets in vivo in real time, which has been one of the prime objectives of the collaborative JDC/MGH imagingprogram. The overall goals of this component of the program, Project 2, has been and remains first, to help evaluatethe applicability of novel imaging methodologies (developed within Project 1 and the Core) to mouse models ofT1D; second, to exploit successful visualization strategies to answer currently unresolved questions aboutdisease pathogenesis in these models (certain in concert with Project 3); and third, to perform proof-of-principleexperiments for translation of successful strategies to human T1D patients (under the auspices of Project 4). During the past funding cycle, Project 2 successfully developed a method to non-invasively image isletinflammation in murine T1D. This technique is based on visualizing, via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ofmagnetic nanoparticles (MNP), the microvascular changes (vessel dilation, vascular leakage) that routinelyaccompany inflammation, coupled with uptake by neighboring macrophages. A mock clinical trial on recent-onsetdiabetic mice clearly established the power of the MNP-MRI technique to distinguish between individuals thatwere or were not responding to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody therapy. These promising results promptedinitiation of a collaborative clinical trial to assess the ability of an analogous MNP, Combidex, to reflect vascularchanges in association with human T1D (Project 4). For the next funding cycle, Project 2 proposes to apply the MNP-MRI technique to additional questionsconcerning the pathophysiology of T1D, but mostly to capitalize on exciting recent advances in fluorescent proteintomography (FTP) made by Project 1 and The Core. At the cutting-edge of whole-body live-rodent imaging, thistechnique permits non-invasive visualization of proteins and cells of interest in deep tissues (eg the pancreas) ofliving mice. The Specific Aims are:1. To develop a system to co-image islet p-cell mass and p-cell activity non-invasively in vivo. A triple-transgenic mouse approach will be taken, exploiting the newly engineered red fluorescent proteins, mRaspberryand dKeima, in conjunction with FTP. Also under this Aim, a series of calibration and validation experiments willput the systems utility to the test.2. To exploit the p-cell mass/activity co-imaging system to tackle outstanding issues concerning type-1diabetes in mouse models. Questions to be tackled include: a) How does p-cell mass/activity change during thenatural history of T1D in the NOD mouse model? b) How do genetic factors impinge on the mass/activity curves?c) Can the residual level of p-cell mass or activity predict onset of overt diabetes? d) Do different therapeuticregimens influence p-cell mass/activity?3. To exploit MNP-MRI to guide dissection of the cellular and molecular elements predicting developmentof clinical diabetes in individual NOD mice. The novel capability of predicting if and approximately when agiven mouse will convert from insulitis to diabetes will be used to address the influence of a NK cells b T helpercell subsets and c CD4+25+Foxp3+Treg cells within the infiltrate. Successful achievement of these Aims should provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of T1D, as well asfurnish proof-of-principle for human imaging endeavors.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MAPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) PageM Form Page 2Project 2: Imaging p-cell attack in mouse models of type-1 diabetes PI: MathiS, Diane PD: Mathis, DianeKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This proposal describes the genetic analysis of the Gag and Pol proteins of the Moloney murineleukemia virus and of the cellular host proteins with which they interact. We have used the yeasttwo-hybrid system to identify novel mammalian proteins that bind to various specific domains ofthe Gag and Pol gene products. We will now focus our ongoing efforts on several of these newtargets: the IQGAP proteins, which interact with the MA portion of Gag; two components of theSUMO transferase system, which interact with the CA portion of Gag; and the ribosomal proteinS3a, which binds the RNA pseudoknot at the Gag-Pol border. Biochemical methods will be used toconfirm and characterize the interactions between the viral and cellular proteins both in vitro andin vivo. To determine the role of these proteins in virus replication, mutations in the viral genes willbe identified that specifically abrogate the interaction with the host protein. These mutations will beintroduced into the viral genome and the effects on virus replication in cell culture will bedetermined. Reversion analysis will be used to further define the requirements for the interaction,and to confirm the importance of the interaction for virus replication. Dominant interfering allelesand RNAi methods will be used to document the requirement for the interaction, and to define thestage of the life cycle at which the proteins act. The generality of the results will be tested byexamining the effects of the genes on the replication of a panel of retroviruses of other families.These experiments will significantly extend our understanding of retrovirus replication, and mayprovide important new targets for antiviral intervention.PERFORMANCE StTE(S) (Ot_lanizagon, city, state)Columbia University70t W. 168th StreetNew York, NY 10032KEY PERSONNEL.

      "PROJECT 1: HDL AND CELLULAR CHOLESTEROL METABOLISMThis project will focus on the cellular and serum factors that affect cholesterol transport between cells andhigh density lipoprotein (HDL)/ apoproteins. Several cell types will be used but study of macrophages will beemphasized. In Specific Aim 1 cellular factors affecting cholesterol efflux will be studied. The hypothesis tobe tested is that the expression level of transporters and the contribution of aqueous diffusion in cholesteroldonor cells together with the concentration/distribution of acceptor HDL particles optimal for these pathwaysdetermine efflux efficiency. We will quantify the contributions of aqueous diffusion and the SR-BI, ABCA1and ABCG1 transporters to efflux from cells exposed to serum, isolated lipoproteins and reconstituted HDL.Protocols using both genetic manipulation and pharmacological inhibitors to measure pathway contributionsto total efflux that were developed during the current grant cycle will be employed. We will also study ifremoval of the cholesterol produced by cholesteryl ester (CE) hydrolysis in macrophage foam cells occursvia specific efflux pathways and how oxidation of CE by lipoxygenases affects clearance. Serum factors thataffect cholesterol flux will be considered in Specific Aim 2. These experiments will test the hypothesis thatHDL remodeling by LCAT, CETP and PLTP alters the relative contribution of different pathways. We predictthat there will be a reciprocal relationship between the effects of serum factors that increase small/lipid poorHDL and serum factors that increase large phospholipid-rich HDL.Specific Aim 3 is designed todemonstrate that the efflux capacity of human serum HDL depends on HDL  quality  and not just total HDLcholesterol. We will use the serum HDL fraction from specimens having similar total HDL-C but differentefflux capacities to understand how macrophage cholesterol efflux is affected by HDL composition. InSpecific Aim 4 we will use an assay we developed to simultaneously measure efflux and influx of cholesterolwhen macrophages are incubated with serum or lipoproteins. These assays will yield values for influx, effluxand net flux when macrophages are exposed to a variety of cholesterol acceptors. The studies proposed inProject 1 arise from close collaborations established in the past with Projects 2 and 3, and will continue to bewell integrated with studies proposed in those projects.The accumulation of cholesterol-loaded macrophages in the arterial wall is an early event in formation ofatherosclerotic plaques. We know this process is reduced by the presence of high circulating HDL levels butdo not understand why. These studies will add to our understanding of HDL function.Children's Hospital of PhiladelphiaPediatrics/GI-Hepatology-NutritionJoseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute3615 Civic Center BoulevardPhiladelphia, PA 19104-4318PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Form Page 281Principal Investigator / Program Director (Last, First.

      "PROJECT 3: MOLECULAR REGULATION OF HDL METABOLISM AND REVERSE CHOLESTEROLTRANSPORT High density lipoproteins (HDL) and their major protein apolipoprotein A-l (apoA-l) are thought to protectagainst atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at least in part by promoting reverse cholesterol transport(RCT), whereby excess cholesterol is removed from the periphery (such as the vascular wall) and returnedto the liver for excretion. The broad goal of this project is to generate greater understanding of the molecularphysiology of HDL metabolism as it relates to reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by using integrated in vivomodels in mice and extending experiments where possible into humans. It has become clear that theplasma concentration of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is not an adequate surrogate for anti-atherogenic effects,and that measures of cholesterol flux through the RCT pathway and of HDL function are more critical withregard to effects on cardiovascular disease. Specific Aim 1 will involve the use of mouse in vivoexperiments to study the structure-function properties of apoA-l, in studies that complement the physico-chemical studies in Project 2 and the cell-based studies in Project 1. ApoA-l variants will be inserted intoAAV8-based gene expression vectors, which will be used to express these variant apoA-l molecules inapoA-l knockout mice and effects on HDL metabolism, RCT, and in selected cases, atherosclerosis will bedetermined. Specific Aim 2 will address, using mouse models, the roles of lecithin:cholesterolacyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP)in modulating the rate of macrophage RCT and the relationship to atherogenesis. Specific Aim 3 willextend concepts and approaches developed in mice into the human setting, with the specific goal ofmeasuring RCT using new methods in humans with Tangier disease (ABCA1 deficiency) and with LCATdeficiency. While high levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease, it isnot clear that simply raising levels of HDL cholesterol are sufficient to reduce cardiovascular risk. Themechanisms by which HDL is altered and the impact on the process of reverse cholesterol transport is likelyto be a more important determinant of cardiovascular risk. This project will seek to understand the regulationof reverse cholesterol transport in living mice and humans.University of Pennsylvania School of MedicineInstitute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics654 BRBII/III421 Curie BlvdPhiladelphia, PA 19104PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Form Page 2173Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Phillips, Michael C.PROJECT 3KEY PERSONNEL.

      "V(D)J recombination defects underlie diseases ranging from immunodeficiency and auto-immunityto cancer. Human SCIDs result either from defects in T cell development or both T and B cell development.The latter disease, referred to as T'B'SCID, generally results from V(D)J recombination defects. Nullmutations in RAG-1 or RAG-2 are the basis for about half of the human TB'SCIDs. Hypomorphic RAGmutations also cause Omenn syndrome (OS), a rare autosomal recessive SCID that often presents as a complex  immunodeficiency with an auto-immune component. Mechanisms by which RAG mutations leadto OS are unknown. A major aim of this application is to elucidate normal RAG functions and aberrant RAGactivities that could lead to complex immunodeficiency and cancer by characterizing RAG mutant mouselines. We have generated mice that lack both the  non-core  RAG1 and RAG2 regions implicated insuppressing transpositions and a mouse carrying a RAG1 point mutation that has a potential joining defectthat may predispose to oncogenic translocations. We will continue analyses of these mice and alsogenerate additional RAG knock-in mutations including several proposed to allow RAG cutting but impairedjoining. We also will employ a novel Abelson Murine Leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed pro-B cell linesystem as a rapid in vivo screen for mutations of interest and as a basis for mechanistic analyses of RAGprotein functions. The other half of human TB'SCIDs have normal RAG proteins; but show V(D)Jrecombination defects and increased ionizing radiation-sensitivity. The defects underlying this subset aremutations in genes that encode the Artemis, XLF and DMALigase 4 non-homologous DMA end-joiningfactors. Human Artemis mutations completely inactivate the gene; whereas human Lig4 mutations are allhypomorphic. It is not yet clear whether known human XLF mutations completely inactivate the gene. Wepreviously generated a mouse model for Artemis deficiency and recently generated mouse models for bothXLF and hypomorphic Ligase 4 deficiency. The other major aims of this proposal are to characterize thesenew models to elucidate normal functions of these NHEJ factors and, again, to determine how mutations inthese genes contribute to various human immunodeficiency syndromes and potentially to cancer. Our immune system recognizes and eliminates a vast array of foreign invaders based on a processin which limitless numbers of antibody genes are formed by cutting and pasting gene cassettes. Defects inhuman genes that code for proteins that carry out this cutting and pasting process cause immunodeficiency(susceptibility to infection). Our proposed research seeks to make mouse models for such human diseasesto better understand the functions of the cutting and pasting proteins and to develop better therapies.Children's HospitalKarp Family Research Laboratories9th FloorOne Blackfan CircleBoston, MA 02115PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): TeitlOrst, ComeliS P.I Alt, Frederick W.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Synaptic strength must be regulated in the face of changing levels of input in order to ensure that total strength I of all inputs are controlled so as to maintain output finng within reasonable limits and these mechanisms must I work in conjunction with mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Its clinical importance can be best illustrated by the I condition of epilepsy where these mechanisms are disrupted at the extreme. The association of epilepsy with l numerous forms of inherited disorders of cognitive function such as Fragile X and Down Syndrome and the l increasing use of anti-epileptic drugs for the treatment of mood disorders highlight the importance or-thesel mechanisms in maintaimng normal brain function. This grant proposes to study the underlyingmechanisms by l which synaptic- adaptation is achieved in the face of changing levels of input and the effects ot this adaptation I on plasticity, building on recent progress in the lab. The first two parts will use strategies to describe morel completely the signaling events in the pathway from synaptic input to synaptic modification, taking advantage I of the ease of manipulation and measurement in the primary culture system. This part of the study will begin I with a careful dissection of the sources of electrical input and calcium entry responsible for the induction ot the I key signaling events, followed by an elucidation of the mechanisms of regulation of key intermedia_ signaling ] products, examining the regulation of their enzymatic activity, stability, transcription, translation and transport I to the synapse. In addition, a more complete description of the signaling cascade will be drawn out trom l microarray studies comparing results from disruption of the signaling pathway at various points. The next part l of the study will look closely at the microphysiology of this phenomenon (a) to elucidate the elements ofl adapation that are cell-autonomous, by comparing effects of network changes and manipulations !n only one I cell (b) to describe adaptive changes at the level of single synapses, and (c) to determine the pre- or l postsynaptic locus of induction of the various elements of adaptation. These studies will take advantage of long / standing expertise in the lab in studying the physiology of single synapses involving focal stimulation and t measurement of synaptic responses at unitary sites. The Iast part of the project will apply the knowledge gained I in the previous sections to try to understand the impact of adaptation m intact hippocampal circuits, using the I organotypic slice culture. Primary questions addressed will be differences in the expression of adaptation at two 1 different sets of afferents and consequences of this adaptation on the induction and expression of LTP. We will I look for forms of LTP not previously found in pyrmnidal neurons and for changes in the performance of/ preexisting mechanisms of LTP.

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Moore, JohnPROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This application is for the renewal of R01 AI45463  Modified envelope glycoproteins for HIV-1 vaccine , a grant first awarded in 1999, re-awarded in 2004, and now being re-competed. Our goals remain the same: To design vaccines intended to induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), based on accumulated and emerging knowledge of structure-function relationships within the HIV-1 Env complex. In this application for 2 years support under the ARRA funding program we have revised our Specific Aims to focus on two sub-projects that we believe can be successfully accomplished within 2 years, and that do not overlap with a HIVRAD Program Project award that will soon be made and in which we direct Project 1 (P01 AI082362-01; Structure and immunogenicity of cleaved, stabilized HIV-1 envelope trimers; Principal Investigator, William C. Olson). We now propose 3 shortened and simplified Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: SOSIP gp140 proteins based on CCR5-inhibitor resistant variants with altered Env configurations. We will make SOSIP gp140 proteins based on resistant variants CC101.19 (with gp120 V3changes) and D1/85.16 (with gp41 fusion peptide changes), study their ability to form trimers and presentNAb epitopes, provide them to Dr. Sriram Subramaniam for structural studies, and prepare them forimmunogenicity studies in mice (Aim 3).Specific Aim 2: To study in vitro how to overcome immunosuppressive effects of gp41 sequences by theuse of adjuvants and TLR activators. We will collaborate with Dr. Min Lu to design, synthesize andevaluate soluble peptide mimetics of the  immunosuppressive peptide  (ISP) region of gp41, in vitro. Ourendpoints will include the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the release of potentially suppressivecytokines. By modifying the ISP sequence, we will identify the residues that are responsible for thesuppressive effects we observe. We will also evaluate whether the suppressive effects of ISP motifs can beovercome in vitro, by the use of TLR activators and other adjuvant-associated molecules.Specific Aim 3: Evaluating the immunogenicity of the novel SOSIP gp140 proteins and theimmunosuppressive effects of the gp41 ISP domain in mice. We will conduct immunogenicity studies inmice that are intended to explore whether the novel SOSIP gp140 proteins based on CCR5 inhibitor-resistant viruses (see Aim 1) are superior immunogens, compared with their parental strain. We will alsoexplore whether the optimal ISP peptide sequence identified in Aim 2 can suppress immune responses toco-administered Env and Gag proteins, and whether any such suppressive effect can be overcome by theuse of an appropriate adjuvant or TLR activator (see Aim 2).RELEVANCE (See instructions):PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name: Weill Cornell Medical CollegeDUNS: 060217502Street 1: 1300 York Avenue Street 2:City: New York County: State: New YorkProvince: Country: USA Zip/Postal Code: 10065Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts: 14Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 11/07) Page 2 Form Page 2\n",

      "Epidemiological studies have shown that the _4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is associated with an increased risk forAlzheimef's disease (AD) while the _2 allele is associated with a decreased risk. ApoE has 3 common isoforms inhumans, E2, E3, and E4. Genetic, biochemical, and animal studies strongly suggest that apoE is likely to influence ADpathogenesis via effects on the metabolism of the 38-43 amino acid amyloid-[3 (Al3) peptide. By crossing amyloidprecursor protein (APP) transgenic mice that develop AD-like pathology with Apoe / mice and transgenic mice thatexpress human apoE isoforms, we have found that the presence ofapoE is critical in the process by which A[3 convertsfrom soluble to fibrillar forms (amyloid) with neuritic plaque formation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Theexpression of human apoE (as compared to murine apoE or no apoE) markedly delays Al3 deposition suggesting thatapoE also plays an important role in A_ clearance. New data suggest that the LDL receptor (LDLR) should be re-explored as a potential modulator of apoE/A_ clearance in vivo. Determining the effects of altering the levels ofdifferent apoE isoforms on At3 in vivo as well as the mechanism(s) underlying these effects is likely to lead to importanlinsights into AD and CAA pathogenesis and treatment. Thus, we hypothesize that the level and composition ofhuman apoE isoforms will alter both the timecourse and amount of AI3 deposition in an isoform-specific fashionvia effects on AI3 clearance and that human apoE isoforms play a role in CNS A[3 clearance in part via LDLR.These hypotheses will be tested in the following aims: Aim 1: To determine if the level of expression of the humanapoE isoforms (via different techniques) influences A]3-related pathology in APP transgenic mice. Aim 2: To assess themechanism(s) by which apoE influences CNS A[3 metabolism in vivo we will use a novel CNS to blood A[3 effiux assayand a new brain A[3 microdialysis technique. Aim 3: To investigate the role of the apoE receptor, LDLR, in A_3metabolism and related pathology in vitro and in APP transgenic mice. Aim 4: To determine the role of the cholesteroleffiux pump, ABCA 1, in modulating the levels and metabolism of apoE, cholesterol, phospholipid, and A[3 in the brain.PERFORMANCE StTE(S) (organization, city, state)Washington UniversityDept. &NeurologyMacMillan HospitalSt. Louis, MO 631 t 0KEY PERSONNEL.

Ms Moore will serve as technical support for all surgical procedures and data analysis. 1. Long term measurement of intravascular pressure using telemetry devices and osmotic mini-Dump implantation: When experiments in this Program Project require rats prepared for chronic directmeasurement of arterial pressure, animals will be instrumented with telemetry catheter transducers purchasedfrom Data Sciences International. This method of blood pressure recording has two distinct advantages. First,it facilitates the continuous monitoring of blood pressure for periods of time up to six months. The rats arehoused individually and minimally impacted since they have been instrumented with a catheter transducer thattransmits blood pressure signals to a receiver unit below the rat cage. Second, the continuous measurementof blood pressure permits the reliable detection of small changes in blood pressure (~5 mm Hg). Further, sinceanimals are chronically instrumented with a telemetry transducer, this method of blood pressure measurementfacilitates experimental deigns that take advantage of statistical analyses utilizing repeated measurementsANOVA. Thus, one can assess the blood pressure before and after experimental manipulations such as drugor dietary treatments (Projects 1 and 5) or induction of pregnancy (Project 5). Publications and experimentsusing telemetry devices are detailed in Projects 1 and 5. To prepare animals for the telemetry measurement of blood pressure, rats or mice are anesthetizedwith ketamine/acepromazine (40-80/2.5 mg/kg) or isoflurane (1-2%) as appropriate with the aims of theparticular experiment. The animal is prepared for aseptic surgery, shaved, and a ventral midline incision ismade in the abdomen. The intestines are displaced to facilitate exposure of the abdominal aorta. A section ofthe aorta 1-2 cm proximal to the terminal aortic bifurcation (in the case of rats) is separated from the venacava. A small hole is made in the aorta with a 23 gauge needle and the telemetry catheter (rats: TA11PA-C40;mice: TA11PA-C20) is inserted into the vessel. A small piece of Dacron  material is inserted between theexternal portion of the catheter and the aorta; Vetbond  (biocompatible super glue) is applied to the incisionsite to help anchor the catheter to the vessel. The other end of the catheter which is connected to thetransducer and telemetry battery pack is sutured to the abdominal wall as the abdominal incision is closed.The abdominal muscle layers are approximated with interrupted sutures and the skin incision is then closed.The animals are treated post-operatively with penicillin G (30,000 units) and an analgesic (buprenorphine; 0.1-0.5 mg/kg). The health of animals with a telemetry catheter is checked regularly to insure that the abdominalincision is healing well. Rats and mice are permitted to recover for a minimum of 10 days before collection ofblood pressure data is begun. Our experience in rats has shown that regular diurnal fluctuations in bloodpressure and heart rate do not return until 10-12 days after implantation of the telemetry catheter. Thetelemetry system that will be used includes a data acquisition interface so that continuously acquired bloodpressure and heart rate as well as animal activity is stored on a computer. The data acquisition systemprovided by Data Sciences International permits the analysis of blood pressure and heart rate over userdefined intervals. Thus, it is convenient to monitor the diurnal variation of blood pressure and heart rate. Osmotic mini-pumps will be used in all 5 projects of the Program. Osmotic minipumps (ALZETmodels) will be implanted for subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intracerebroventricular, intrauterine, andintravenous infusion. In all cases, the surgical implantation site will be prepared by aseptic techniques in ratsanesthetized with ketamine/acepromazine (40-80/2.5 mg/kg) or isoflurane (1-2%). For subcutaneous andintravenous infusions, a small (1 cm) incision will be made in the skin overlying the area between scapulae anda pre-loaded pump will be inserted through the incision into a subcutaneous pocket prepared by bluntdissection. When intravenous infusion accompanies the subcutaeous implantation, appropriate size cathetertubing will be attached to the pump portal after guidance and fixation into a jugular vein or lateral ventricle.Catheterization will be performed through a small (1 cm) skin incision overlying the jugular vein; approximately2 cm of tubing will be fixed within the vein, and the remainder will be tunneled under the skin for attachment tothe pump portal. Lateral ventricle cannulae will be placed as described in Project 4.Skin will be closed with 3-0non-absorbable suture. Intraperitoneal placement of pumps will be performed through skin and abdominal wallincisions (1 cm each). Both incisions will be closed individually with 3-0 non-absorbable suture. 2. Long-term Measurement of Cardiac Output or Regional Blood Flow: Ascending aortic orregional blood flows will be measured by implantation of flow probes manufactured by Transonic Systems, Inc.This type of flowmeter system measures blood flow by ultrasonic transit-time technology and, thereby, providesa direct measurement of volume flow in ml/min. Chronic measurement of cardiac output will made inPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 11/07) Page 438 Continuation Format PageProgram Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): FerrariO, CarlOS Mariaexperiments of Project 5 that focus on systemic hemodynamic regulation during pregnancy. Rats will beanesthetized with ketamine/acepromazine (40-80/2.5 mg/kg) or halothane (1-2%) as appropriate with the aimsof the particular experiment, prepared for aseptic surgery, and the trachea intubated. The rat is then placed ona ventilator and ventilated at a rate of 90 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 1-2 ml per stroke. Anincision is made in the right thoracic wall and the thoracic cavity opened via the third intercostal space. Theright lung is compressed with a neurosurgical sponge and the ascending aorta visualized. Adventitial tissue isdissected away from the ascending aorta. A flow probe (Transonic Systems Inc.;2PSB) is placed around theascending aorta and the electrical cable from the flow probe brought out through the second intercostal space.The neurosurgical sponge is removed, the lungs reinflated, and thoracic cavity closed. The thorax isevacuated via a chest tube introduced through the sixth intercostal space. The cable of the flow probe istunneled subcutaneously, brought out through the skin button between the shoulder blades, and led throughthe stainless steel spring. When the above surgical procedures have been completed, the rat will be treatedpost-operatively with penicillin G (30,000 units). The animal is then placed in its home cage, the leads from theflow probe connected to an electrical commutator (Dragonfly, Inc.;Model SL-36). The electrical commutator isconnected to a flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc.; Model TS420). In some experiments of Project 5 rats willalso be instrumented for the chronic measurement of blood pressure as well as ascending aortic blood flow.With this type of preparation, Dr. Brosnihan will be able to monitor changes in total peripheral resistance inaddition to alterations in blood pressure and cardiac output during the course of pregnancy. In otherexperiments blood flow to the mesenteric), hindlimb, or renal circulations will be made. In these experiments,rats will be anesthetized as described above and the vessel of interest exposed (mesenteric artery, terminalaorta, or main renal artery). In most cases a 1 mm flow probe (Transonic Systems, Inc.; 1PRB) will be used formeasurement of blood flow. 3. Assessment of Left Ventricular Structure and Function by Transthoracic Echocardioaraphv(TTE): TTE examinations is conducted on rats anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (50mg/kg/5mg/kg;i.m.)using a commercially available sector scanner equipped with a 12 MHz phased-array transducer (PhilipsMedical Systems,Andover, MA). Animals are place in a left lateral supine position and the TTE probe is placedcarefully to obtain the short and long axis as well as 4 -chamber apical cardiac views. From the short axis, anM-mode tracing of the left ventricle (LV) is obtained and measurement of LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDD), LVsystolic diameter (LVSD), posterior (PWT), and septum (SWT) diastolic wall thicknesses is made according tothe American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (1).The percentage of LV fractional shortening (FS), anindex of global systolic function, is calculated as ((LVDD - LVSD)/LVDD) x 100.To asses diastolic function,mitral inflow measurements of early and late filling velocities (E and A, respectively), deceleration slope (Edecslope), and early deceleration time (Edec time) are obtained using pulsed Doppler, with the sample volumeplaced at the tips of mitral leaflets from an apical four-chamber orientation. Doppler tissue imaging to assessearly mitral valve septal annular velocities (e1) is also obtained from the four-chamber view. This parameter isbelieved to be less influenced by ventricular load conditions. Ratio of E/e',an index of LV filling pressure, isalso calculated. All measured and calculated systolic and diastolic indices are represented as the average of atleast five consecutive cardiac cycles to minimize beat-to-beat variability. Representative examples areprovided in Figure 1. Figure 1. Representative echocardiographic images.

Analysis of Central Regulation of Blood Pressure by Evaluation of SpontaneousBaroreflex Sensitivity. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured directly through an indwellingcatheter in the femoral artery or telemetry probe situated in the aorta. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and RRinterval (RRI) files generated via the BIOPAC acquisition software (Santa Barbara, CA) or Datasciencestelemetry at 1000 HZ will be analyzed using Nevrokard SA-BRS software (Nevrokard SA-BRS, Medistar,Ljubljana, Slovenia) through the following methods. a. Frequency Method: Power spectral densities of SAP and RRI oscillations will be computed by 512 points Fast FourierTransform (FFT) and integrated over the specified frequency range (LF; 0.25-0.75 Hz) and (HF; 0.75-5.0 Hz).A Hanning window will be applied and the spectra of SAP and RRI series, and their squared-coherencemodulus, will be computed if the coherence is greater than 0.5 in accordance with reported criteria (8). Thesquare-root of the ratio of RRI's and SAP powers will be computed to calculate LF, HF alpha indices, whichreflect the baroreflex sensitivity. Power of RRI spectra in LF, HF range (LFRR| and HFRR|) will be calculated innormalized units and the ratio of LFRR|/HFRR| will be used as a measure of sympathovagal balance (9). Powerof SAP spectra is calculated as LFSAp will be used as a measure of blood pressure variability (BPV). b. Sequence Method: Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity calculated by this method is based on quantification of sequences ofat least three beats (n) in which SAP consecutively increases (UP sequence) or decreases (DOWN sequence),accompanied by changes in the same direction of the RRI of the subsequent beats (n+1). In order to beincluded in the baroreflex sensitivity estimate, each sequence must fulfill the following criteria(10): (1) minimalRRI change 3 ms; (2) minimal SAP change 1 mm Hg; (3) minimal number of beats, 3 or more, in thesequence; (4) minimal correlation coefficient of 0.85. The software scans the RRI and SAP records, identifiessequences, and then calculates linear correlation between RRI and SAP for each sequence. If the correlationcoefficient exceeds a pre-set critical value (0.85), the regression coefficient (slope) is calculated and accepted.The mean of all individual regression coefficients (slopes), which is a measure of sequence BRS is thencalculated. Overall, three parameters will be obtained by this method (Sequence BRS- SAP UP, DOWN andTOTAL). c. Time-Domain Analysis: Three time-domain SDRR rMSSD parameters will be used to measure C pre hemodynamic variability as in previous studies (11;12). Heart rate variability (HRV) is determined by computing the standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDRR) and the C pre C post 1-7 pre 1-7 post C pro C post 1-7 pre 1-7 post root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences in R-R interval duration (rMSSD). The Seq All standard deviation of the mean arterial pressure (SDMAP) is used as a measure for blood pressure variability (BPV). The Nevrokard software has been used in studies in sheep, rat Cpra Cpost 1-7 pre 1-7 post Cpra Cpost 1-7 pre 1-7post and humans and has been validated by us against classical measures of Figure 2. C pre (white bar), C post (gray bars) correspond to parameters before and baroreflex function in sheep and rats after intracisternal injection of the control fusion protein, whereas 1-7 pre (black bar) (13-15). The software allows and 1-7 post (gray bar) correspond to before and after intracisternal injection of Ang- analysis of blood pressure data(1-7) fusion protein. acquired by Biopac, Data Scienceand a variety of other commercially available systems.

Pregnantanimals will be anesthetizedwith isoflurane and positionedon a rat handling platform. Allof the hair will be removed fromthe abdomen and pre-warmedgel will be used as a couplingmedium. Maternal heart ratesand rectal temperatures will bemonitored. A Vevo 770  High-Resolution in vivo ImagingSystem (VisualSonics, Inc,Toronto, Canada) is available inthe laboratory of Dr. April Ronca(see letter of consultation forProject 5). Pregnant rats will beimaged with a RMV ¿ 71 OBHigh Frame Rate Scanhead(Real-time Micro Visualization)probe and a PW (Pulsed WaveDoppler) transducer. The high-pass filter will be set at 6 Hz,and the pulsed repetitionfrequency will be set at 20 kHz.A 0.2 -0.5 mm pulsed Dopplergate will be used and the anglebetween the Doppler beam andthe vessel will be set at <30¿.Doppler waveforms will beobtained from the proximal anddistal uterine artery and thearcuate artery. Peak systolicvelocity (PSV) and end-diastolicvelocity (EDV) will be measuredfrom 3 consecutive cardiaccycles that are not affected bymaternal breathing. Theresistance index will becalculated (RI=[PSV-EDV]/PSV.The flow in placenta bed veinswill also be monitored.

The maternal placenta (mesometrial triangle) and fetalplacenta (labyrinth) are shown. A blood vessel (white arrow) that traverses the fetal placenta is also present,from which vessel diameter and flow can be determined.Progress Report A subset of (mRen2)27 TG rats that exhibit heritable malignant hypertension was identified during thefinal years of the previous grant cycle; we are currently in the process of creating a colony of these rats throughselective breeding and offspring phenotyping techniques under separate funding. A subset of Hann SDfemales was identified that that when bred with homozygote (mRen2)27 males allow increased hemizygoteoffspring expression of the malignant hypertensive phenotype. This subset of (mRen2)27 TG rats developmalignant hypertension at about 8 weeks of age; these animals generally succumb to stroke, aneurysm, oracute heart/renal failure. Expression of the phenotype is related to the Hann SD background, since previousreports by Whitworth et al. (16)showed that the phenotype was eliminated or intensified depending on strainbackground. Currently, there are no specified experiments or funds required within the grant application foruse of this model; we believe, however, that this is an important model that may provide future experimentalapplications.National Significance of the Breeding Colonies The success of the Transgenic Animal Colony to provide animals for significant research efforts isreflected by the number of publications in which Colony animals were used (see individual Projects for thesereferences). In addition, the importance of the Colony as a national resource for transgenic rats isdemonstrated by the fact that approximately 50% of rats produced in Grant Years 13 and 14 for researchpurposes were shipped to outside investigators at cost. The Lew.mRen2 congenic rat colony is in productionand remains the sole source of this unique hypertensive rat model; several publications resulted from use ofthis new genetic model during the grant year; production of this model represents an increasing percentage oftotal production. Finally, the identification of a subset of (mRen2)27 with heritable malignant hypertension andestablishment of a colony with the phenotype will provide the single world-wide source of this model ofhypertension.

      "a general prescription for treating disease. Drugs are theprimary tools for this purpose, and the synthetic organic chemistry required to fashionthem today is much the same as it was a century ago. Finally, the economic hurdlesassociated with drug discovery are daunting. This Pioneer proposal addresses a technology that can close the gap between basicresearch discoveries, and the application of such insights to medicine. The approach,called  chemical evolution  (see below), provides the means to breed drugs out ofenormous synthetic small-molecule populations. It has the potential to transform drugdiscovery from a process requiring hundreds of chemist-years and the infrastructure of alarge pharmaceutical company, to something a graduate student with knowledge of basicmolecular biology can accomplish in a month. Chemical evolution is closely related tonucleic-acid and protein evolution techniques with proven track records in academia andindustry. Moreover, our recent pilot studies have definitively established the feasibility ofevolving small molecules[1-3]. These studies were the subject of two Science andTechnology review articles in Chemical and Engineering News over the last year, andthey were named a  Chemistry Highlight  for 2004 (a short annual compilation by theAmerican Chemical Society of key advances in chemistry)[4-6]. Despite its enormouspotential and the excitement it engenders, three different federal agencies have declinedto fund further development of the technology on the grounds that it is too ambitious andtoo risky.Shaping Small Molecules A single paradigm has dominated drug development in the modern era. Discoverybegins with lead compounds, which are either known medicinal agents or moleculesidentified by high-throughput screening of compound collections. Variants of the leadcompounds are synthesized by an army of medicinal chemists, and retested for biologicalactivity. Efficacy, specificity and pharmacological profiles are incrementally optimizeduntil derivatives can be found that perform adequately in animal models. The optimizedmolecules are then tested in human beings through three stages of clinical trials. Recenteconomic studies put the total cost of this process in excess of 800 million U.S. dollarsfor the development of a single successful drug, with the price tag for the pre-clinicalphase falling in the range of 300-600 million dollars[7]. Paradoxically, the traditionaldiscovery process is becoming increasingly inefficient. Gross expenditures on drug R&Din the U.S. increased from $15 billion in 1996 to $25 billion in 2002, while the number of2005 Pioneer Application --- 1new molecular entities approved yearly by the FDA dropped from 56 to 17 over the sameperiod[8]. A radically different paradigm for molecular discovery, based on mimickingevolution in a test tube, is beginning to challenge the traditional approach. Thetechniques, collectively termed in vitro evolution1, utilize diverse libraries of geneproducts, each of which is physically associated with a corresponding DNA blueprint.The library mixtures are subjected to affinity purification over an immobilizedmacromolecule, to physically isolate gene products with a desired binding property(many alternative functional selections have also been applied). The DNA blueprints inthe isolated pool are then amplified and translated to produce a second-generation library.Over multiple iterations of this selection, amplification and translation process,high-affinity and high-specificity binders to the macromolecule target emerge from thepopulation. Isolation of nucleic acid and peptide ligands from libraries of up to onequadrillion different molecules has become a routine practice that is widely used in basicscience labs[9]. The approach is simple, effective and inexpensive. Aside from cost and speed, in vitro evolution methods have a huge numericaladvantage over traditional screening strategies. Large numbers translate into qualityadvantages in the products that are isolated[10]. Estimates based on the human antibody,T-cell receptor and olfactory receptor repertoires suggest that libraries with complexitiesexceeding 1010 should generally provide ligands with nanomolar affinities[11]. A typicalsmall-molecule collection at a pharmaceutical company comprises one million differentcompounds, and is analyzed at a rate of 300,000 compounds/day. By comparison, in vitroevolution libraries generally comprise 109-1014 distinct molecules. To put the differencein perspective, a bead-based2 library of 1014 compounds would flood an Olympic pool,would weigh hundreds of thousands of kilograms, and would require several hundredmillennia to screen at a state-of-the-art facility. The impact of in vitro evolution approaches on drug discovery has been quitelimited because the techniques are restricted to biopolymer libraries. Nucleic acidaptamers and peptide ligands generally lack the membrane permeability and metabolicstability required of medicines, although special cases are beginning to appear in theclinics. However, two new technologies, DNA display (developed in my lab) and DNA-templated synthesis (DTS), have recently changed the fundamental nature of the game[1-3, 12]. DNA display and DTS facilitate direct chemical translation of DNA genes intocovalently attached synthetic small-molecule gene products. Thus, in vitro evolution ofcombinatorial chemistry libraries is now possible. We proved the point by chemicallytranslating a DNA-encoded library of one million synthetic pentapeptides, and affinitymaturing it over two generations against the [Leu]enkephalin-specific 3E7 antibody toproduce a nanomolar ligand (Figure 1). This accomplishment currently represents one ofonly two chemically translated libraries (ours being greater than four orders of magnitudelarger than that of Liu et. al.[12]), and it is the only chemically translated library to havebeen propagated over multiple generations through DNA blueprints. We have developedgeneral, highly efficient methods for synthesis on DNA supports, and have carried out in1 Examples of in vitro evolution methods include aptamer selection, SELEX, phage display, polyribosomedisplay, RNA display and peptides on plasmids.2 Synthetic libraries used in high-throughput screening are often prepared on inert polystyrene beads, withone compound per bead.2005 Pioneer Application --- 2vitro selections against multiple proteins. The work creates enormous, unexploredopportunities in chemical evolution. To transform these pilot studies into a useful tool,the chemical evolution approach must be adapted to operate on complex libraries of drugable  small molecules. Were this achieved, basic-science labs could rapidly andcheaply identify cell permeable ligands with nanomolar to picomolar KD's for thebiological entities they study, with tremendous benefits for medical research.Fig. 1. Left: The DNA display microcolumn splitting scheme used to encode synthesis. The DNA support library (top) is split byhybridization to anticodon microcolumns (colored), and then transferred to DEAE microcolumns (black and white). The DNAsupports in each sub-pool are coupled to a distinct chemical building block through the reactive group at the 5'-end of the support. TheDNA is then pooled and re-split based on the subsequent coding region. Right: Affinity maturation of a chemically synthesizedlibrary. Approximately 70 DNA genes from each round of translation, selection and amplification were sequenced, and the results aresummarized as a histogram plot. The x-axis indicates the number of amino acid residue matches to [Leu]enkephalin encoded by alibrary sequence. The y-axis indicates the round of library evolution (0: starting material, 1: after round one selection, 2: after roundtwo selection). The z-axis indicates the number of sequences encoding a particular number of matches (x-axis) in a particular round(y-axis). The critical attributes of chemical evolution are that it is inherently  low tech ,inexpensive and easy. Thus, it eliminates economic and technological barriers thatimpede molecular discovery. It can empower a wide range of scientists with minimalresources, and who lack a lifetime of prior experience in synthetic organic chemistry, toexplore  chemical space  for compounds with rare and desired properties. The reactionsused to build small-molecule populations, and to produce individual compounds on atherapeutic scale, are necessarily straightforward (no Mount Everest-type complexnatural product synthesis is involved). The cost of producing large quantities of theresulting small-molecule drugs is manageable, as opposed to the case for protein andnucleic-acid therapies.Forward Applications of Chemical Evolution Since completing our pilot studies last summer, we have worked on developing amassively parallel format to evolve drugable libraries of ~1011 compounds (thecompounds conform to the  Lipinski rules of five , an empirical set of physical chemicalcriteria characterizing successful prescription drugs with good oral bioavailability). Wehave organized a series of collaborations to test the technology in animal models.Selective kinase inhibitors - We are evolving inhibitors active against thefrequently occurring Gleevec-resistant mutant Bcr-Abl(T315I). The mutant kinasearises in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, and in chromic myelogenous2005 Pioneer Application --- 3leukemia patients experiencing blast crisis. In collaboration with David Lockhart(Ambit Biosciences) we will profile the kinase inhibitors against the entire humankinome, and determine whether we can evolve inhibitors with singular specificity.We have established a second collaboration with Charles Sawyers (UCLAMedical School) to test the molecules in a SCID mouse model of drug resistantCML.Dengue Virus protease inhibitors - In collaboration with Karla Kirkegaard(Stanford Medical School), we are evolving inhibitors of the Dengue Virus NS2/3protease. We will test the resulting molecules in an interferon ¿/¿ receptor-interferon ¿ receptor double knockout mouse model of Dengue infection.Interleukin-5 Receptor ¿ antagonists and asthma - In collaboration with GregBarsh (Stanford Medical School), we are evolving antagonists of the IL-5R¿receptor, which is exclusively expressed in basophils and eosinophils. We willtest whether coordinate pharmacological inhibition of the IL-5R¿ receptor and theeotaxin CCR3 receptor can reverse induced airway eosinophilia and airwayhyper-responsiveness in a BALC/c mouse model of asthma.Pathway-specific PET contrast reagents for early detection of cancer - Incollaboration with Pat Brown (Stanford Medical School), we are evolvingtyrosine-containing substrates that are selective for a single tyrosine kinase. Wewill test whether cells with dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity selectivelyaccumulate flourine-18 derivatives of these substrates, and whether we canexploit this phenomenon to non-invasively image aberrant growth signals by PETscanning.Countless applications of chemical evolution exist. Some ideas include creating cell-typespecific targeting reagents, evolving small molecule affinity tags for  omics  arrays,producing  smart sensor materials  that possess molecular recognition properties, andgenerating small-molecule catalysts for asymmetric and regioselective organic synthesis.Chemical evolution might accelerate the acquisition of knowledge in vertebratemolecular physiology by readily providing small molecule tools for experimentation inanimal models (zebrafish, mouse, primates etc.). In addition, chemical evolution couldpotentially solve the problem of engineering small molecules to disrupt protein-proteininteractions, and make small molecules ligands as accessible as antibodies, only cheaper. I consider each of our ongoing projects extremely worthwhile, but efforts tosecure funding for them have failed. Reviewers have commended the ideas ( clever  and state of the art ) while ultimately dinging the proposals as too risky. A Pioneer awardcould fund all of the projects at a high level.Protein Footprinting and Computational Design My lab at Stanford includes two research programs unrelated to chemicalevolution. One program aims to develop alternatives to x-ray crystallography and NMRspectroscopy for measuring protein structure  in the wild . A key goal is to obtainstructural data on proteins in biologically relevant environments, such as in a membrane2005 Pioneer Application --- 4bilayer, on a cytoskeletal filament, or as part of a large complexes. We have developed aprotein footrprinting approach called MPAX that combines quantitative aspects ofhydrogen deuterium exchange with the versatility of chemical modificationtechniques[13]. MPAX utilizes a novel translational misincorporation strategy tointroduce cysteine structural probes throughout a protein, and allows us to monitor inparallel the accessibility of the probes to solvent, and the identity of the residuesneighboring the probes. Early work with MPAX has provided the first detailed unfoldingpathway for a large protein, the (¿/¿)8-barrel triosephosphate isomerase[14]. In ongoingwork, we are adapting MPAX for de novo determination of protein three-dimensionalstructures. We are also developing kinetic footprinting reagents that will allowmeasurement of protein conformational changes on a sub-millisecond timescale. MPAXis a new and general structural tool that has been adopted by a number of labs in theUnited States, Europe and Australia. The ultimate goal of the third research program is to computationally engineerenzymes. As a graduate student, I designed the first protein sequence to adopt a backbonetopology not observed in nature[15]. My lab at Stanford has gone on to develop moresophisticated protein modeling algorithms, and we have applied them to the problem ofautomating the design of specificity in molecular recognition[16, 17]. A major aspect ofour work is to base all designs on physically rigorous molecular mechanics potentialswith a continuum treatment of solvation. This intellectual perspective runs counter to theprevailing trend in the computational design field, which relies almost exclusively onknowledge-based statistical potentials.Total Professional Effort: If I receive a Pioneer award, I will commit at least 75% of myprofessional effort to the science it supports. All of the projects I have tackled sincearriving at Stanford are high-risk/high-payoff; so finding funding has been a constantbattle.1. Halpin, D.R. and P.B. Harbury, DNA display I.

      "Combining a biomechanical approach and two unique animal model systems that mimic two differentaspects of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), our new proposal will focus on determining theconsequences of MMP inhibition at the cellular and structural levels. We will demonstrate that the abnormallevels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in AVMs and resultant vascular instability are due to acombination of two mechanisms high blood flow rate induced MMP expression in inflammatory andvascular cells and AVM vascular cell's intrinsic property to abnormally express high levels of MMPs. WhenMMPs, which originated from these two underlying mechanisms, are inhibited pharmacologically orabolished genetically, it results in restoration of vascular stability at the structural and cellular levels. SpecificAim 1: Roles of high blood flow induced-MMPs and inflammation on structural integrity of bloodvessels. We hypothesize that high blood flow rate will increase MMP levels in the vascular wall and causevascular instability. Structural instability of blood vessels caused by high blood flow induced-MMP expression/ activation can be reversed by inhibition MMPs. Specific Aim 2: Roles of abnormal expression of MMP-9from AVM vascular cells on maintenance of pro-angiogenic phenotypes. We hypothesize thatexpression of abnormally high levels of MMP-9 by AVM vascular cells is their intrinsic property and thatabnormally high levels of MMP-9 result in vascular instability. AVM tissues implanted in the brain and underthe kidney capsule retain intrinsic pro-angiogenic phenotypehigh levels of MMP-9 and MMP-9 associatedchanges in other angiogenic factors while control tissues (superficial temporal artery and normal braincortex samples) retain angiogenically quiescent phenotype. MMP inhibition changes the implanted AVMtissues from pro-angiogenic phenotype to quiescent and stable phenotype by decreasing the release andavailability of other angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Significance: This project will elucidate two potentialmechanisms for the abnormal expression of MMP-9 in AVMs. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that MMPinhibition can modify angiogenic phenotype of AVM tissues and restore structural stability of blood vessels.Findings from this study will be a basis for development of MMP inhibition treatment to restore vascularstability of AVMs in patients and prevent future hemorrhage.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 225 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director (Last. First, Middle): PI: Hashimoto, T / Director: Young, WL.IntroductionWe would like to thank the study section for many positive and constructive comments that enabled us to refineand focus our project. The original proposal for Project 2 submitted in May 2007 received a score of 1.9. Thecommittee pointed out that this proposal is  a good project with interesting ideas and using innovativemolecular tools  and that  the pilot data is relatively strong,  The committee also noted  the interactions withother projects and cores are very good .Four main suggestions for improvement from the committee included (1) the need to more carefully definehemodynamic conditions in the flow augmentation models, (2) the need to be careful with difficult controls inthe implantation models, (3) the need to carefully define how inflammatory baselines might alter outcomes inthe SCID mice, and (4) the need to pay some attention to consequences of long term MMP suppression. Inaddition, the committee noted some question regarding the appropriateness of the proposed models.We will address these five points raised by the committee, followed by specific critiques from each reviewer. Asshown in this paragraph, major changes in the text are denoted by a double line in the right margin of the textand identified by a bracketed marker (e.g., ).1. More detailed characterizations of hemodynamic conditions in the surgical augmentation modelsTo carefully define local and systemic hemodynamic conditions in flow-augmentation models, we performednew preliminary experiments. First, we established a blood pressure measurement method using a tail cuffsystem, by validating it against the intra-arterial catheter method that is considered to be a gold standard forblood pressure measurement. Using the tail cuff method, we found that neither unilateral carotid ligation norsham surgery causes any significant changes in blood pressure in mice, consistent with previous finding byothers.63 Along with our blood flow data, these data indicate that an increase in blood flow, not in bloodpressure, is a major triggering factor for outward vascular remodeling in our model. We will follow bloodpressure using a tail-cuff method in both the wild type and knock out mice during the experiments.Second, we performed preliminary studies to characterize differences in the flow-augmented vascularremodeling among different strains of wild type mice and knockout mice. There were baseline differences inthe vascular diameter among different strains of mice. However, there was no difference in the baselinevascular diameter between the knockout mice and corresponding wild type mice. Although the degree ofoutward vascular remodeling was slightly different among different strains of mice, outward vascularremodeling was found to be a universal phenomenon. These findings emphasize (1) the need for baselinemeasurements of local and systemic hemodynamics and vascular diameter, and (2) the necessity forappropriate control groups to control for baseline differences among strains.Third, we have established another method to characterize blood flow in the mouse common carotid arteryusing an ultrasonic transit probe (Transonic) as presented in Preliminary Studies. This technique allows us tomeasure acute changes in the blood flow in more details than the pulse wave Doppler-based technique. Weare currently applying the ultrasonic transit probe to the mouse basilar artery.We verified that there is an increase in basilar artery diameter after the common carotid ligation in mice. Thisfinding provides indirect evidence that common carotid ligation causes outward remodeling of the basilar artery(a true intracranial artery) presumably mediated by the increase in the blood flow. As noted above, we verifiedthat unilateral common carotid ligation does not change the blood pressure acutely or chronically.2. Control tissues in implantation modelThe reviewer raised a concern regarding the use of structurally normal cerebral cortex tissues obtained duringepilepsy surgery as a control in the implantation model. We have been using the structurally normal cerebralcortex tissues as control tissues, because these tissues are highly vascularized and have high density ofendothelial cells. In our previous report,45 we showed that endothelial cells in these control samples exhibitednormal morphology and were angiogenically quiescent and were indistinguishable from normal brain cortexobtained from the autopsy samples. Nevertheless, we agree that the microvasculature in cortex may bestructurally and functionally different from larger blood vessels in the AVM nidus. As the reviewersacknowledged, normal human intracranial blood vessels with the similar diameter and structure are notavailable. However, they made a constructive suggestion of using normal artery from the same human.Therefore, in addition to the normal cerebral cortex samples, we will use the superficial temporal arterysamples harvested during the surgical exposure. We currently have collected and snap frozen ten specimensfor other purposes. We estimate that at least five superficial temporal artery samples per year will be availablePHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 226 Continuation Format Page\n",

      "OF RESEARCH PLAN FOR MERIT EXTENSION (lALONGO, R37 DA11796) The central purpose of this MERIT extension is to extend through age 25 an examination of normal and pathogenic development and the impact of two, universal, first grade, preventive interventions on the distal targets of antisocial behavior, substance abuse/dependence, psychiatric symptoms/disorders, and successful adaptation to the relevant developmental demands of the educational, work, peer group, romantic relationships, and family (both family of procreation and origin/orientation) socialfields/contexts.This application capitalizes on the scientific value of two ongoing studies: 1) a prospective, developmental epidemiological prevention trial involving a population (N = 798) of urban, predominately African-American youth, who begin first grade in the fall of 1993 in 9 elementary schools in predominantiy low to lower middle-income Baltimore areas (lalongo et al., 1999) and 2) an ongoing study of allelic variants (Uhl et al., 2007, 2008) that predispose to addiction vulnerability in research volunteers drawn from many of the same Baltimore neiglnborhoods. Participants in the epidemiological prevention trial sample were randomly assigned to one of two universal, elementary school-based, preventive interventions (Classroom- Centered, CC, and Family-School Partnership, FSP), which targeted antecedents of later substance use/abuse/dependence, antisocial behavior, anxiety and depression: 1) aggressive/disruptive behaviors, and 2) poorschool achievement Annual data on mental health, educational, substance use, abuse, and dependence outcomesand the hypothesized moderators and mediators ofthese outcomes (including youth, family, peer group, school, andneighborhood characteristics) have been collected from 1(R)' grade through age 21. Participants in the ongoing studyof allelic variants among research volunteers that predispose to addiction vulnerability have had more than 500,000SNP allelic frequencies determined in African-American samples. In this application, we are requesting funds to extend through age 25 the annual follow-up assessments ofantisocial behavior, psychiatric symptoms/disorders, substance abuse and dependence, and successful adaptationto the relevant developmental demands of the educational, work, peer group, romantic relationships, and familysocial fields/domains. We are also requesting funds to annually assess the moderators and mediators ofthesedevelopmental and inten/ention outcomes, along with mental health and drug treatment services utilization and thefactors associated with unmet mental health and drug treatment need. The requested funds would also allow for acontinued collaboration between the JHU investigative team and Dr. George Uhl of the NIDA-IRP MolecularNeurobiology Branch to study candidate gene and candidate genomic markers of substance dependence in thewell-characterized participants in our developmental epidemiological prevention trial population. Dr Uhl's laboratoryhas identified markers for allelic variants that display nominally-significant differences in terms of substancedependence between both European- and African-American samples of research volunteers who come from manyof the same Baltimore area zip codes as the members of our current prevention trail sample. In his laboratory'sstudies of DNAs from more than 1250 individuals with the outlying phenotypes, he has assessed allelic frequenciesof more than 500,000 SNP markers in studies of more than 200 million genotypes. With this data In hand. Dr Uhlcan identify genomic markers that are likely to reproducibly distinguish substance dependent individual from controlindividuals in Baltimore populations. These underlying data are thus likely to provide some of the best genomiccontrols currently possible to avoid stratification artifacts, the major problem with association genetic studies thatmight otherwise be a significant issue with the admixed African-American populations identified in US urban centers. The knowledge gained over tfie life of the proposed research should serve to inform the field as to (a) forwhom these universal interventions work as a function of their pheno- and genotypic characteristics, (b) to whatdegree, (c) for how long, (d) in what contexts, (e) what else is needed in terms of mental health or drug treatmentservices or preventive interventions (e.g., selective interventions or indicated interventions), and (f) when in theelementary, middle, high school, and early adult years these additional interventions should be implemented. The unique scientific opportunities the proposed study provides are reflected in our specific aims:1. Modeling Intervention Impact and Variation In Developmental & Intervention Outcomes. To assessintervention outcomes through age 25 to determine the extent to which genetic factors influence variation ininten/ention outcomes through youth and family characteristics. To examine possible roles of interventions as wellas family, peer group, school, and neighborhood factors as moderators of potential genetic effects, seeking specificgene x environment interactions..2. Assessing the Incidence, Prevalence. & Antecedents of Emerging Mental and Substance Disorders. Touse genotypes from blood or buccal/salivary samples to model genetic influences on the onset, course andcomorbidity of psychiatric symptoms and disorders and substance use, abuse, and dependence through youth andfamily characteristics from 1¿' grade to age 25. To examine the potential roles of family, peer group, school andneighborhood factors as moderators of potential genetic effects (gene x environment Interactions) on the onset,course, and comorbidity of psychiatric symptoms and disorders and substance use, abuse, and dependence.3. Assessing the Degree of Unmet Need and the Factors Associated with It To assess the degree of unmetmental health and drug treatment need and the factors associated with it. This knowledge should determine theneed for interventions aimed at improving sen/ice utilization among urban, economically disadvantaged, African-American, young adults, and the factors targeted by those interventions.lalongo, NicholasProgram Director/Principal Invesligator (Last, First, Middle): lalongo, Nicholas CHECKLISTTYPE OF APPLICATION (Check ali that apply.)I I NEW application.

      "Intimal hyperplasia and/or constrictive remodeling are major causes of recurrent disease followingvascularreconstruction. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-P) is an important cytokine that has been found to be integrallyinvolved in both of these processes. The goal of this proposal is to explore the role of TGF-P signalingintermediates inthe pathophysiology of intimal hyperplasia and constrictive remodeling. We will specifically examine a family ofintracellular signalingproteins, termed SMADs, and their role in these two processes. Our laboratory and others haveshown that TGF-P inhibits smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and stimulates apoptosis; functionsthat would limitintimal hyperplasia. Conversely, TGF-P stimulates extracellular matrix production (collagen I being the predominanttype), an effect that enhances the formation of hyperplastic lesions. In preliminary experiments, we have found thatSmads selectively mediate the effects of TGF-p. Specifically, SmadS stimulates collagen expression but has no effect onSMC proliferation.These differential functions of SmadS in SMCs may allow us to design molecular tools that canselectively preserve the  inhibitory  effects but block the  stimulatory  effects of TGF-P on intimal hyperplasia. In thestudies detailed in this proposal, we will further define the role of SmadS and other Smad proteins in vascular SMCfunction. In specific aim I we will evaluate the function of Smads in SMC by transiently transfecting wild type anddominant negative mutant Smads as well as reporter genes for SMC function into SMC lines. We will then createadenoviral vectors that express selected Smads that appear to have a significant impact on SMC physiology and test theireffect in human primary vascular SMC. In specific aim II, we will explore the interaction of TGF-P with the promoter ofthe gene of type I collagen. The ultimate goal of these experiments will be to design an oligonucleotide decoy that can actas a selectivegenetic inhibitor of collagen transcription. Finally, in specific aim III we will test the hypothesis thatstimulation and/or inhibition of Smads or selective inhibition of the collagen promoter can limit the formation of intimalhyperplasia in a rat model of vascular injury. We anticipatethat the results of these studies will both enhance ourknowledge of the pathophysiology of intimal hyperplasia and also allow for the design of novel therapies to inhibit thiscomplex human disease process which affects thousands of patients each year.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Weill MedicalCollegeCornellUniversity1300 York AvenueNew York, NY 10021KEY PERSONNEL.

      "High blood pressure is a strong, modifiable, independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, and was a primary or contributing cause of 11% of U.S. deaths in 2003 (American Heart Association, 2006). The health burden of high blood pressure has persisted despite marked improvements over the past several decades in the identification and treatment of hypertension and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including high cholesterol (Hajjar & Kotchen, 2003). Psychosocial risk factors such as loneliness, hostility, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and low/ social support have also been shown to predict high blood pressure and/or hypertension, but distinctions among these psychosocial factors in the mechanisms through which they increase hypertension risk have not been well characterized. Understanding the specificity of associations between psychosocial risk factors and mechanistic pathways through which they act to increase risk of high blood pressure is another frontier along which to wage the battle for control of an ongoing and growing public health problem. In earlier research, we observed that lonely young adults exhibited chronically elevated levels of total peripheral resistance (TPR) relative to nonlonely young adults (Cacioppo, et al., 2002; Hawkley et al., 2003). Increases in TPR are the primary determinant of increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) until at least age 50. Faster rates of increase in TPR and SBP foster earlier development of arterial stiffening and further increases in SBP, suggesting that-the higher levels of TPR we observed in lonely young adults might, over time, accelerate the development of high blood pressure in lonely individuals. In support of this hypothesis, we found that loneliness was associated with elevated SBP in a population-based sample of older adults aged 50-68 years, and that this association increased as a function of participants' age (Hawkley et al., 2006). Moreover, loneliness was independent of a constellation of related psychosocial factors (i.e., depressive symptoms, perceived stress, hostility, and poor social support) in its association with SBP. In the present project, we propose a cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of young to middle-age adults (26-55 years old) to test whether loneliness is unique in its association with TPR, and to examine five physiological pathways through which loneliness might be related to TPR. We hypothesize that loneliness is associated with TPR through its association with (a) impaired endothelial function, (b) increased oxidative stress, and altered activity of the (c) sympathetic nervous system and (d) hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis. Identification of plausible mechanisms for the association between loneliness and TPR will set the stage for future longitudinal research that examines the causal role of these mechanisms in explaining how loneliness influences risk for elevated TPR and high blood pressure.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of Chicago, Chicago, ILPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page Continuation Fomiat PageProgram Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, fVllddle): Hawkley, Louise CDETAILED BUDGET FOR INITIAL BUDGET PERIOD DIRECT COSTS ONLYPERSONNEL (Applicant organization only) Months Devoted to Project ROLE ON Cal.

      "Persistent eosinophilic inflammation is a principal characteristic of asthma, with important physiologic consequences.The intensity of the allergic inflammatory response does not differentiate allergic subjects, with and without asthma.Inflammation in asthma, however, is prolonged. Therefore, signals that switch-off inflammation may be crucial inpromoting resolution of allergic inflammation. One putative switch-off factor is the cytokine interleukin-10 [IL-10], whichinduces eosinophil apoptosis, and suppresses TNF-  production. We have shown that lung expression of IL-10 inallergic asthmatics is virtually absent, in contrast to allergic non-asthmatics, in whom IL-10 levels are increasedcompared to healthy volunteers. We propose the following Central Hypothesis: IL-10 is a critically important to theresolution of allergic inflammation. A genetically-engineered IL-10 deficient  knockout  (IL-10i) mouse strain offers theopportunity to perform critical mechanistic tests of the role of IL-10 in the allergic inflammatory process. Accordingly, theSpecific Aims are to establish: 1) the pattern and timing of development and resolution of inflammation and physiologicchanges following allergen sensitization and challenge, and the degree and characteristics of allergic sensitization; 2) themechanisms which underlie the observations of Aim 1; 3) the specificity of IL-10 in mediating the anti-inflammatoryresponse after allergen challenge, and 4) the role of TNF-  in enabling the inflammatory response to allergen challenge.These cytokines have direct and demonstrable relevance to human asthma. IL-101mice and control strain animals willundergo allergen sensitization and challenge; allergen specific IgE, differentiation of Th1-Th2 lymphocytes,allergen-driven inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness will be key outcome variables. In addition, functionalknock-out animals will be produced by administration of neutralizing IL-10 antibody, and will undergo similar studies.This information will provide direct evidence of the role of IL-10 in regulating allergic inflammation, and will help toascertain the relationships between inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of PittsburghPittsburgh, PennsylvaniaKEY PERSONNEL.

      "UNAIDS estimates that 14,000 persons are newly infected with HIV every day throughout the world, of which one halfare between the ages of 15 and 24. New infections occur despite widespread awareness of the modes of HIV-1transmission, and the protection afforded by condom use. Novel concepts for HIV-1 prevention are urgently needed.We propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of chemoprophylaxis for HIV prevention in a randomized and blindedtrial of daily oral tenofovir 300 mg versus placebo among men in Peru, who have extremely high risk of acquiring HIVinfection. Daily oral tenofovir 300 mg is selected for evaluation because it is FDA-licensed for human use, allows once-a-day dosing, is well-tolerated, is active against many drug resistant HIV-1 strains, and was demonstrated to beeffective for prevention in non-human primate models. We propose to enroll 2100 men who will be randomized 1:1 toreceive daily oral tenofovir 300 mg versus placebo and followed for 13 months for HIV-1 seroconversion (aim 1),adverse events (aim 2), and viral load, drug resistance and CD4 T cell count after seroconversion (aim 3). Study sitesare selected in Peru because of their well-developed prevention research infrastructure and their demonstrated ability torecruit men at high risk for HIV infection with outstanding rates of retention. Recruitment will be derived from 3 citiesin Peru that had the highest incidence of HIV-1 infection in two recent surveys, have the required infrastructure tosupport a closely monitored clinical trial, and represent enormous genetic and geophysical diversity. The sample size issufficient to detect cost-effective levels of HIV-1 prevention. The trial also aims to evaluate the safety of this agent inHIV uninfected persons, including the incidence of mild renal insufficiency and liver inflammation. Chemoprophylaxismay involve durable benefits or risks as well, possibly leading to an attenuated course of infection due to earlyinhibition of viral replication or drug resistance. The proposed research addresses important gaps of knowledgedirectly, including the safety and efficacy of daily oral tenofovir chemoprophylaxis among men exposed to HIV afterrectal exposure. This unique and essential information bears directly on HIV prevention in the Americas and will notbe available after the completion of other studies planned for the United States, Asia and Africa. The safety andefficacy of chemoprophylaxis may differ in men and women due to differences in reproductive biology, the mucosalsurfaces that are typically exposed to HIV, behavioral differences, and pharmacokinetics. This research ultimately aimsto break the epidemic cycle of HIV-1 by protecting men at risk for HIV, and may spare their sexual partners and theirfuture children.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, Asociacion Civil Impacta Salud y EducacionThe J.

      "Chronic alcoholism increases the incidence and severity of respiratory diseases and infections.Indeed, alcoholics compared to non-alcoholic individuals have increased mortality and morbidityduring bacterialpneumonias. While much is known about the role that chronic alcohol plays inincreasing the severity of respiratory bacterial infections, much less is understood about howchronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption alters the severity of pulmonary virus infections. Interestingly,our preliminary studies indicate that chronic EtOH increases both the morbidity and mortality ofinfluenza A virus infections. Further our results suggest that the increased severity of disease mayrelate to defects or alterations in both respiratory dendritic cells as well as influenza-specific CDS Tcell responses. Given the current threat of both epidemic and pandemic influenza a betterunderstanding of the lesions within the pulmonary adaptive immune response in chronic alcoholicscould lead to methodologies to boost immunity to this Important human pathogen. Therefore ourlong-range goal is to determine what lesions chronic EtOH induces within the respiratory adaptiveimmune response. Within this application we will continue to use the Meadow-Cook chronic EtOHmodel as well as our mouse models of influenza virus infection to determine the EtOH associatedlesions that occur within respiratory dendritic cells and influenza-specific CDS T cells. Our centralhypothesis is that defects within both respiratory dendritic cell function and CDS T cell responsesare responsible for the observed increased severity of influenza virus infections in chronic EtOHmice. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determination of the lesion within the restingpulmonary immune system of chronic EtOH mice 2) Determination of the pathogenicity of influenza-infection in chronic EtOH mice 3) Detennination of the role of DC in chronic EtOH enhancedinfluenza-associated pathology 4) Determination of the rple of influenza-specific CDS T cellimmunity in enhanced disease in chronic EtOH mice. This proposal will not only define the defectsthat chronic EtOH creates In pulmonary adaptive immunity during respiratory virus infections butshould also increase our understanding of immunity during other (bacterial/fungal) respiratoryinfections. Furthermore, the insights learned from this proposal hold the potential to suggestmethodologies to restore and/or boost immunity in chronic alcoholics during these diseases.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, slate)University of Iowa, Carver College of MedicineIowa City, Iowa 52242PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 200 Form Pago 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (LasL First, Middle): Cook, Robert T., Research Component #2KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Long-temn alcohol consumption progressively leads to multiple immune defects. Chronic alcoholics displaylesions in both innate and adaptive immunity, and experience increased rates of bacterial and viral infection.Of particular interest, extended alcohol intake leads to abnormalities within the B cell compartment withreduced B cell numbers, poor antibody (Ab) responses and aberrant regulation. In addition to immunedeficiency caused by extended ethanol intake, children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) also displayimmunologic deficits and higher infection rates. Given the inherent difficulties in studying alcoholic patientsand FAS children, the utilization of animal models is essential to understand the extent of immunedysfunction after alcohol exposure, and the means by which ethanol mediates damage. In order to bettermimic chronic alcoholism, as well as fetal alcohol exposure, we have exploited the ethanol-in-drinking-watermouse model that allows for long-term alcohol consumption without nutritional deprivation or systemic stressImportantly, after months of ethanol intake, mice exhibit multiple immune abnormalities including reduced Bcell numbers in the peripheral lymphoid organs and compromised Ab responses. Of interest, these lesionsare accompanied by progressive disruption of lymphoid integrity in the spleen, suggesting alcohol to inducestructural damage within secondary lymphoid tissues. Using the ethanol-in-drinking-water model we havealso successfully bred mice and brought them to term with minimal loss of pups. While remaining on ethanol,the females nursed the same pups allowing for alcohol exposure during the entire gestational and neonatalperiod. After reaching adulthood, these fetal/neonatal ethanol mice exhibited both physical and functionalimmune lesions. Using this model, studies in this proposal will explore the means by which ethanol damagesperipheral lymphoid organs, whether adaptive immunity recovers after withdrawal arid if fetal/neonatalethanol exposure leads to permanent immune lesions. Aim 1 will therefore investigate which mechanismsessential for secondary lymphoid organization are disrupted after long-term ethanol intake. Aim 2 will test thehypothesis that oxidative stress induced by alcohol triggers damage in secondary lymphoid tissue. Aim 3 willtest the hypothesis that withdrawal from ethanol after extended consumption will lead to only partial recoveryof immune function. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that alcohol exposure during development leads topemnanent damage within secondary lymphoid organs and life-long immune deficiency. All four Aims willprimarily focus on the status of lymphoid integrity and B cell competence. Chronic alcohol abuse leads tosignificant lesions in adaptive immunity with accompanying mortiidity and mortality. FAS children likewiseexperience immune deficiency and increased rates of infection. The proposed studies will offer novel insightsinto the mechanisms by which long-term alcohol exposure injures the adaptive immune system, and whetherpotential therapies can be designed to help reverse damage and recover immune function.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of lowa, Carver College of Medicinelowa City, lowa 52242PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 240 I Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Cook, Robert T., Research Component #3KEY PERSONNEL.

      "The cerebral cortex is a highly interconnected sheet of neurons that are constantly active and interacting.This ongoing interaction allows context-dependent complex behaviors to be generated by providing amechanism for the rapid and dynamic modulation of neurdnal responsiveness and flexible coupling ofcortical neurons and networks. The generation and impact of cortical-cortical interactions depends upon aprecise balance of recurrent excitation and inhibition. In-addition, information processing in the cortexdepends critically upon the rate and timing of action potentials. The proposed projects will reveal thefunctional balance of recurrent excitation and inhibition in vivo and the cellular mechanisms by which the rateand timing of action potential generation is controlled, including during natural sleep and waking. The cortexis built to generate periods of persistent activity, such as during the operation of working memory, or inrelation to selective attention. The mechanisms through which persistent, but at the same time rapid,changes in neuronal activity and responsiveness are generated in cortical networks will be investigated. Theh-current has proven to be a very important contributor to network activity, through the control ofcommunication between the soma and dendrites of single neurons. The important role of the h-current inpersistent activity will be investigated. Finally, the mechanisms by which neuronal network discharge, suchas with epileptic seizures, spontaneously stops will be examined with recordings from synaptically connectedpairs of neurons. The possibility that synaptic depression or the activation of intrinsic ionic currentscontributes to the natural, but temporary, cessation of epileptiform or sleep-related cortical bursts of activitywill be examined. These studies will yield valuable information into the basic mechanisms by which corticalnetworks operate through recurrent excitation and inhibition and how this operation is prevented from beingconverted into the abnormal discharges of neurological disorders such as epilepsy.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state).Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CTKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Establishing the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) willfundamentally alter the nature of clinical and translational investigation at UIC and our partners (Advocate HealthCare, Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, Ul Peoria, Ul Rockford, Ul Urbana). Harnessing our diversity ofbackground, interests and expertise, the UIC CCTS will effectively catalyze collaborative thinking and innovation.The CCTS will organize, finance, and house the infrastructure, expertise, and resources of value to clinicaltranslational investigators within a single academic home, with leadership that reports to the highest levels of UICadministration. This reorganization crosses administrative boundaries to harness and enhance existing UICresources. A major element of UlC's vision for its future its operationalized by establishing the UIC CCTS, whichwill have the following Specific Alms. Specific Aim # 1: Create and develop an academic home for clinicaltranslational research at UIC. This home will provide a flexible and adaptable infrastructure to stimulatecollaborative thinking, generative discourse, and collective action to facilitate clinical and translationalinvestigation. The creation of this home will include establishing a robust Pilot Grant Program, a Clinical andTranslational Science Academy, a web-based and geographic single-point-of-access for investigators to makeuse of CCTS expertise and resources, and a CCTS Matchmaking service to identify and catalyze novelcollaborations. Specific Aim # 2 contributes to the academic home by establishing the research serviceinfrastructure (the 6 Research Service Cores) to provide clinical research support services required by clinical andtranslational investigators. Soecific Aim # 3 contributes to creation of the academic home by providingmultifaceted educational experiences for pre-and post-doctoral trainees, junior faculty, and established facultywishing to extend their thinking beyond their current disciplinary boundaries. Establishing the UIC CCTS willoptimize collaboration with our key clinical research partners, and allow us to facilitate new and innovativeinvestigation in pediatrics and community-based science. The administrative reorganization represented by theUIC CCTS will lead to rationalization and integration of significant and mature UIC resources for clinicaltranslational research. It will add to these resources to produce something better for clinical translationalresearchers and trainees at UIC and at key partner institutions.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, ILAdvocate Health Care, Oakbrook, ILJesse Brown VA Medical Center, Chicago, ILUniversity of Illinois, Peoria, ILUniversity of Illinois, Rockford, ILUniversity of Illinois, Urbana, ILPHS 398 (Rev. 11/07) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Mazzone, Theodore, MDKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The Tri-lnstitutional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine (CBM) takes advantage of theoutstanding educational and research resources of Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, the Weill Cornell MedicalCollege in New York City, and the Sloan-Kettering Institute (the research arm of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) to train computational biologists in the interdisciplinary approaches they need tosolve the complex problems that characterize biology and medicine.The CBM training environment is designed to address the unique challenges of training scientists in thisarea and is characterized by: (i) coursework in both quantitative and biological sciences; (ii) researchrotations to enable a well-informed thesis topic selection; (iii) journal clubs and research-in-progress series toenhance program cohesion and ensure fluency in relevant disciplines; (iv) thesis research in one of a diversearray of basic to translational computational and experimental laboratories; (v) both quantitative andbiological mentorship in order to ensure training balance and breadth; (vi) encouragement to engage inhybrid computational/experimental projects to foster connections between theory and experiment.The enthusiastic support for the CBM program by the Tri-lnstitutional consortium has enabled the program toenroll and support 6 students annually. However, now that the program is well established and entering itssixth year, it is clear that it would benefit from an increase in its most vital component - outstanding students.To that end, the goal of this T32 proposal is to receive funding to increase our annual admission to 9students. The justifications for such growth include: (i) an unmet demand by CBM faculty for students; (ii) theCBM applicant pool is deep enough to allow for an increase without either lowering quality or decreasing thepercentage of admitted domestic students; and (iii) a national need to train more computational biologists. Byenabling such growth, T32 funding would aid the CBM program in achieving its mission of training the nextgeneration of scientist to use computational and analytical methods, often integrated with experimental andclinical studies, to solve complex interdisciplinary problems in biology.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Multidisciplinary research at the Chemistry:Biology interface has expanded so rapidly in the past fewdecades that such cross-training is now crucial for the development of the next generation of chemists andbiologists. The objectives of the proposed training program at Texas A&M University is to train predoctotalgraduate students in the Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Biology departments in research atthe Chemistry:Biology Interface (CBI). Since its inception in 1994, this NIH-sponsored program has played amajor role in the successful training of our graduate students in the molecular life sciences. The programcurrently involves 27 faculty members, with highly diverse research interests including : a) mechanisticenzymology (Raushel), b) macromolecular interactions (Hu, Reinhart, Schultz); c) synthesis (Burgess,Connell, Darensbourg, Romo, Yang); d) bioanalysis (Cremer, Russell, Vigh); e) metabolism (Begley, Lindahl,Watanabe); f) structure/function relationships (Barondeau, Hilty, Sacchettini); g) computational reactionmechanisms (Gao, Singleton); h) chronobiology (Golden and Bell-Pederson); i) behavioral biology (Garcia)and j) chemical biology (Pellois, Liu, Ryan, Young). Such diversity is a major strength of our CBI program, asit makes it attractive to a wider range of students and affords for greater cross-training at theChemistry:Biology interface. Students in the CBI program choose one of these trainers as their primaryresearch advisor, and enroll in a core group of required courses in which training in quantitative biology isstressed. CBI students enroll in a weekly journal club in which research topics from these area arediscussed, emphasizing the connection to human health, physiology and disease. Students also enroll in aclass on the Ethical Conduct of Research. The CBI program sponsors an annual symposium in whichexisting trainees present their research results and new trainees are introduced into the program. Well-known external speakers are also invited as part of the training program. A former CBI student is invited tohelp current CBI students develop their careers. Towards the end of this 2-year program, students apply toattend a summer workshop course at an external location in which classroom and laboratory instruction arecombined in an intense scientific setting. The CBI program also supports CBI students to attend a scientificconference annually.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Texas A&M University, College Station, TexasPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Lindahl, Paul AlanKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which normal brain function is disrupted as a consequence of intensiveburst activity from groups of neurons. Synchronized population spikes are key concomitants to seizure, butthe phenomenon has remained a paradox because it cannot be explained by any known neuronal synapticmechanism. Several lines of evidence suggest a key role of glutamate in the pathogenesis of depolarizationevents, which in turn trigger synchronized firing. The observation that astrocytes release glutamate via aregulated Ca2+ dependent mechanism prompted us to hypothesize that glutamate released by astrocytesplays a causal role in epileptogenesis. Our recent study snowed that chemoconvulsive agents including 4-APand bicuculline triggered TTX-insensitive paroxysmal depolarization shifts in hippocampal slices which wereclosely correlated with astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations. Photolysis of caged Ca 2+ in astrocytes, but not inneurons, was sufficient to trigger local depolarization events. Furthermore, agents that blocked astrocyticglutamate release reduced epilepiform activity, with no effect on baseline EEC in adult rats.The next critical step is to expand the analysis to reactive astrocytes in epileptic animals. We propose hereto analyze astrocytic Ca2+ signaling in epileptic mice with cranial window using 2-photon imagingconcomitant with EEC recordings. We will correlate astrocytic signaling in reactive astrocyteswith neuronalfiring in epileptic mice. Reactive astrocytes are easily identified in live exposed cortex based upon theintensity of GFP emission in transgenic mice expressing GFP under the GFAP promoter. The hypothesisthat the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs is better correlated with the potency by which they reduce astrocyticCa 2+ signaling and glutamate release, than with their direct effects on synaptic transmission, will be tested.These experiments offer a new conceptual and operational approach to understanding the cellular basis ofseizure disorders. If a dysregulation in Ca2+ signaling in reactive astrocytes indeed proves causal inepileptogenesis - asourpreliminary data strongly suggest - then theimplications ofthis newperspective topharmacotherapy could be profound. By more specifically targeting the glial cause of neuronal excitability,we might be able to achieve more specific, less variable and less toxic treatment options for patients withepilepsy.University of RochesterSchool of Medicine and Dentistry601 Elmwood AveRochester, NY 14642PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Nedergaard, MaikenMiddle):KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Childhood obesity in the United States has dramaticallyincreased in the past decade. The proportion of children exceeding the 95lhand 85vhpercentiles for body mass index (BMI) is among the greatest in Mexican-Americans. Despite the high prevalence of obesity amongHispanic children, the genes underlying the heightened susceptibility to childhood-onset obesity in Hispanic populations have not beeninvestigated. The specific goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that a number of genes, each with a measurable effect on the expression ofchildhood obesity, can be identified by the use of a systematic genomic screen. The specific aims are:1) to identify and phenotype 300obese Hispanic probands (ages 4-18 y) and their biological parents and siblings, 2) to construct a 10cM map for 1600 Hispanic individualsto be used in a genome-wide scan for loci that affect quantitative phenotypes of adiposity and energy expenditure using high-throughputgenotyping techniques, 3) to perform a multipoint genome scan to find and localize QTLs that influence quantitative variation in adiposity,and energy expenditure in children by performing variance component linkageanalysis,and 4) to use multivariate quantitative trait linkageanalysis to test whether QTLs localized in Aim 3 have measurable pleiotropic effects across phenotypes. Our target sample will include 1600 genotyped individualsdispersed over 300 nuclear families with a minimum of threechildren,ascertained on the obese proband using a bivariate scheme (i.e., >95lh percentile for BMI and >85'h percentile for fat mass).Phenotypingwill includeanthropometry and body composition, as well as factors associated with the development of obesity: energy partitioning duringgrowth, energy expenditure, physical fitness and activity, hormones, metabolites, and neurotransmitters. Anthropometry and bodycomposition measurements will be repeated after 1 y to determine body weight and fat change in the children. Approximately 360 hyper-variable STR markers willbe typed for each individualto produce a 10cM genome map. Multipoint linkageanalysis using variance components methods will be applied to nuclear family data to search for QTLs influencing obesity-relatedphenotypes in Hispanic children.We will test the null hypothesis that the additivegenetic variance due to a QTL equals zero (no |linkage)jy comparing the likelihood of this restricted model with that of a model in which the variance is estimated. This QTL method will bemplemented in the program package SOLAR using estimationprocedures from FISHER. Lastly, we will test for pleiotropic effects ofobesity-related QTLs across phenotypes.PERFORMANCE S1TE(S) (organization, city, state)Baylor College of MedicineUSDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research CenterHouston, TXSouthwest Foundation for Biomedical ResearchSan Antonio, TXKEY PERSONNEL.

Faculty from thesedepartments have research programs spanning a broad set of topics in computational and systems biology, includinggene and protein network modeling and reconstruction, cell and tissue engineering, bioimaging and image informatics,regulatory genomics, proteomics, predictive toxicology and metabolic engineering, nanobiology and microsystems,computational biophysics, and integrative cancer biology. This proposal seeks to expand the pool of training faculty bymore than a dozen, including 7 faculty newly hired in the past 4 years who have active research programs in the field.Students apply directly to the CSB Ph.D program from their undergraduate or Master's institution and receive multi- and nter-disciplinary training in the field of computational and systems biology. The proposal seeks to support 8 students forthe first two years of the Ph.D., enabling extended research rotations and participation in unique program activities.Unique aspects of the program include: (a) close association with the multi- and inter-disciplinary research agenda of SBi and of the participating labs; (b) a unique core formed from newly developed, inter-disciplinary classroom subjectsthat combine biology, engineering, statistics and computation; (c) intensive advising and multi-disciplinary thesiscommittees to optimize the training experience for students from diverse academic backgrounds; (d) a seminar seriesprogram with active student participation focusing on leading edge research both within and outside of MIT; (e) anannual symposium and an annual retreat with participation of students and faculty focusing on research, leadership,and challenges to interdisciplinary research.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)MITWhiteheadBroad InstituteRelevance. The proposed training program will enable training of a new type of researcher, withinterdisciplinary expertise in concepts, approaches and technologies from biology, computer science,and engineering. This new group will be ideally positioned to assume leadership positions inbiomedical research, which increasingly involves the application of sophisticated technologies andadvanced modeling techniques to design and predict sites of intervention in complex gene networksto achieve desired therapeutic aims in diseases such as diabetes and cancer.PHS 398/2590 (Rev.11/07) Page o Continuation Format Page Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Burge, Christopher(Continuation from Cover Pages)SCIENTIFIC/KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Title: Chronic alcohol abuse disrupts CD8+ T cell function. In this component we will explore CD8+ T cellfunctional parameters after chronic ethanol exposure in mice. This work arises from many past observationsin chronic human alcoholics who have increased CD8+ T cell activation markers, a shift toward a memoryphenotype, and an increased rapid IFNy response after in vitro stimulation. Published work from ourlaboratories and others has shown comparable findings in CD8+ T cells from mouse spleen, after manyweeks of 20% (w/v) ethanol in water ingestion. In recent work we have found that there is a deficient antigen-specific CDS primary response after inoculation with an attenuated strain of the intracellular pathogenicbacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. Additional findings include several subset alterations, reducedexpression of the IL-2 receptor beta subunit, and a reduced proliferative rate. Of interest, these changes canbe modeled in part by the administration of certain TLR agonists, and the chronic ethanol mice havedemonstrable increases in circulating peptidoglycan. In this component we will examine CDS functionalresponses to CDS immunodominant epitopes and other stimuli. Aim #1 will evaluate CD8+ T cell memoryresponses to several defined epitopes after inoculation and later challenge of chronic ethanol mice.Recovery of the deficient CD8+ T cell response will be tested after ethanol withdrawal. Direct inoculation ofethanol mice with peptide loaded dendritic cells will be compared with standard inoculation with organisms.Aim #1 tests the hypotheses that a) both primary and memory responses of CD8+ T cells are affected bychronic ethanol; b) that these changes are irreversible; and c) that the defect is not one of antigenpresentation in vivo. Aims #2 and #3 will focus on the abnormal signaling responses of CD8+ T cells fromchronic ethanol mice, and comparisons with the alterations produced by certain TLR agonists. These aimsare based on the observations in CD8+ T cells from chronic ethanol mice and/or TLR agonist treated normalmice, of reduced IL-2R-beta expression, reduced proliferative response of CD8+CD44lo cells andparadoxically increased  expression of activation markers. This component interacts strongly with the AnimalCore, the Technical Core, and Research Components #2 & #4 and Pilot Component projects #3 & #4.

If the application is funded, thisdescription, as is. will become public information. Therefore, do not include proprietary/confidential information. DO NOT EXCEEDTHESPACEPROVIDED.The overall goal of this CTSA program is to create an integrated, efficient, and proactive academic home topromote, facilitate, and transform clinical and translational research at Northwestern University (NU) and itsaffiliated clinical institutions. The program includes participation by six NU schools and all four of its affiliatedhospitals. The focal point of this application is the new Northwestern University Clinical and TranslationalSciences (NUCATS) Institute, a physical and intellectual home for its leaders, member faculty, and researchtrainees. The major principle driving this program of teaching, research development, and infrastructureisthat an integrated and focused research organization can propel the translation of research findings into mproved patient care and population health more rapidly and effectively than the decentralized approachesto clinical and translational research that now exist in most academic institutions. The NU CTSA applicationhas 4 goals: 1. Provide new, broad-based, and coordinated leadership to accelerate translation of ideas intohealth-care solutions within the Northwestern University community and beyond by systematically studyingand promoting multidisciplinary research interactions in the context of new research teams and, in so doing,to gain fundamental insights into the process of clinical/translationalcollaboration 2. Create and support anew and expanded set of research and training resources (tools) that will support new discoveries, newtechnology development, and translational team-based research3. Educate and encourage a broad range ofscientists.and health care providers to study and solve important health problems in a team-basedenvironment at the interfaces between fundamental science, clinical medicine, and the community 4.Evaluate the impact of the new tools and new collaborations that we have developed in order to continuouslyimprove our outcomes. The faculty leaders chosen to direct the Institute and its functional components havethe experience, authority, and committed time to administer the new home for clinical and translationalresearch.

      "The objectives of the CPCRA Clinical Trials Unit (Community Programs for Clinical Research onAIDS) are: to conduct clinically relevant research in the prevention and treatment of HIV disease and itscomplications; to involve in clinical trials a demographically, geographically, and socio-economically diversepopulation of individuals infected with HIV or at risk of infection; and to carry out this research agenda inclose collaboration with community members who are themselves infected with or affected by HIV. The CPCRA CTU will make significant contributions to the INSIGHT and HIV Prevention Trials (HPTN)networks, both in enrollment and in scientific expertise. Through INSIGHT, the CPCRA CTU will contributeto multiple, randomized clinical trials in order to help determine the optimal clinical management for personswho are HIV+. These trials include studies of those who are: highly-antiretroviral (ARV) experienced and forwhom virologic suppression cannot be achieved and maintained; ARV-nai've, with advanced HIV diseaseand presenting for care with an opportunistic infection; co-infected with HIV and hepatitis virus; or atmoderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular disease. Through the HPTN, the CPCRA CTU will contribute to trialsexamining both behavioral and therapeutic interventions with behavioral and biologic outcomes, seeking toreduce HIV transmission and HIV transmission-risk behavior. Targeted populations include those who areHIV+, as well as those who are HIV- and at-risk for seroconversion, such as injecting-drug and cocaine usersand others at risk for seroconversion through sexual contact. The Executive Office of the CPCRA Clinical Trials Unit, located at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centerin Washington DC, is an off-campus affiliate of the applicant institution, The George Washington University.The Principal Investigator and Executive Office staff provide oversight, central coordination, training andeducation, technical assistance, and regulatory support for its 137 clinical research sites, organized byregion into 23 Site Coordinating Centers in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Peru, and South Africa. Thesesites have in care a cumulative, demographically diverse patient base of over 152,000 persons withHIV/AIDS. HIV is a major public health problem around the world. It is important to find better ways to use themedicines that we have to treat HIV, so that people who are infected can live longer and healthier lives.

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Mendelsohn, Cathy L.PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):Vitamin A is required for formation of most organs and tissues. Our studies have been focused on urogenitaltract abnormalities which are among the most common birth defects in humans. We have shown that RA isrequired at multiple stages of urogenital tract formation, in the kidney for branching morphogenesis and in thecommon nephric duct for ureter transposition. In both, RA acts by inducing expression of Ret in epithelial cellsthat undergo distinct types of remodeling. Our recent studies reveal additional requirements for RA duringnephric duct formation and during colelcting duct elongation.We have recently generated a new mouse model inwhich a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor has been inserted into the Rosa26 locus following a STOPsequence. Expression of this mutant RA-receptor generates a blockade of RA signaling in cells expressingCre recombinase, enabling cell type-and temporally controlled inhibition of RA signaling. We will use thismouse line in Aim 1, to identify the mechanism by which RA regulates Ret transcription; selectively inactivatingRA-receptor mediated signaling in the ureteric bud, renal stroma and nephrogenic mesenchyme. We will studythe normal mechanism by which the nephric ducts insert into the primitive bladder in Aim2 and we willi identifythe role of Vitamin A in this process. Our analysis of mutants lacking Raldh2, the major RA synthesizingenzyme reveals abnormalities at late developmental stages in tubule extension and a novel domain of Raldh2expression at the cortico-medullary junction where local proliferation and oriented mitosis occur during papillaformation, suggesting that RA may be important for these processes. We will characterize the role of RA duringprenatal and postnatal stages of papilla formation in Aim3 by expressing the dominant negative Rar receptorin the papilla and we will then analyze the effects on tubule extension and oriented mitosis. In addition toidentifying potentially new and important roles for vitamin A during development, our studies should helpelucidate the molecular and cellular basis of urogenital tract birth defects so that they can one day be treated orprevented.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Mild Vitamin A deficiency is present in 5-7 million pregnant women worldwide, a condition that in animalmodels can result in sub-optimal organogenesis. Understanding the role of vitamin A during gestation is thusof great importance. Our studies of urogenital tract malformations induced by vitamin A deficiency may aid inour understanding of the basis of these defects so that they can one day be treated or prevented.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name: The Trustees of Columbia Universityin the City of New YorkDUNS: 62-188-9815Street 1: 650 West 168th Street Street 2:City: New York County: New York State: NYProvince: Country: USA Zip/Postal Code: 10032Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts: 15thAdditional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:\n",

      "Saliva is an important diagnostic fluid that has the potential to be used for detection of essential biomarkersfor both oral and systemic diseases. Unfortunately, the current lack of reliable detection methods formeasurement of important analytes within this complex biomatrix has hindered progress in salivarydiagnostics. To help remove this barrier, recent promising activities have been initiated in microfluidic-basedLab-on-a-Chip (LOG) systems. While several miniaturized platforms are being developed now, few of thesesystems have evolved to the point where important protein biomarkers can be measured over thephysiological range using real saliva samples. Towards this essential goal, the team of investigators from UTand UK have developed and documented carefully an integrated biochip assay system that is suitable formeasurement of panels of important inflammatory markers (e.g.CRP, IL-1beta, MMP-8, TNF-alpha, IL-6)insaliva. This newly fashioned ultra-sensitive method has been used to extend saliva-based diagnostics to thelow levels of CRP found in saliva, therefore allowing for the first comparison of CRP levels between healthy,periodontitis, and edentulous patients. The miniaturized system correlates nicely with establishedmacroscopic  gold standard  methods. Thus, it now important to take the next steps to combine thesefunctional components and associated methodologies so as to create a flexible platform system that may beused to promote and expand the field of salivary diagnostics. This U01 renewal program targets thedevelopment of portable devices that can be used to complete salivary diagnostic tests. The program willevolve with important biochip, analyzer and immunoassay development milestones to be completed in thefirst two years of the program. In year 1, integrated biochips and analyzers will be developed and tested.These alpha prototypes will be used to define specifications for more final systems. In year 2, fully developedbiochips and analyzer suitable to serve, as beta prototypes will be fashioned. These highly functionalportable systems will be used in years 3-5 to complete pre-clinical testing and validation. Salivary biomarkerfingerprints that our team has already defined will be used to 1) discriminate stages of periodontitis and 2)identify risk for future cardiac events in coronary artery disease patients. Final data acquisition and FDAapproval will be completed by year 5.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TexasThe University of Kentucky, Lexington, KentuckyThe University of Louisville, Louisville, KentuckyThe University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TexasPHS 398(Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last,First, Middle): McDevitt, John TKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Northwest American Indians are a drastically understudied and underserved group, at ilsk for multiple healthproblems induding poor maternal health during and after pregnancy. American Indians living in theNorthwest have very high rates of poor maternal and irtfant outcomes. This application, in response to RFAHHS-2009-HIS-NARCHV-O001, involves a 4-year developmental project to explore matemal healthbehaviors, maternal substance use, risk factors for substance use during and after pregnancy, and protectivefactors that support healthy matemal behaviors. Findings will assist the research team in designing aculturally appropriate and feasible intervention program for American Indian mothers living in the Northwest.Building upon existing preliminary epidemiological and surveillance data as well as tribal support, this studyproposes five innovative and significant aims. First, we will conduct qualitative formative research involving 4focus groups and 25 key infomiant interviews with mothers aged 18-55, Native health providers,elder/traditional healers, and Native youth (aged 15-25). Second, we will conduct structured surveyinterviews with 100 American Indian community members. With these inten/iew data, we will establishpreliminary baseline data related to matemal health outcomes, protective health tjehaviors, risk factors forsubstance use during and after pregnancy, and social support for mothers. Third, we will develop andmanualize a culturally-based intervention targeting adult American Indian mothers in the Northwest. Fourth,we will translate and disseminate the findings to the tribe and prepare translational materials for communitymembers and service providers. Fifth, throughout the course ofthe study, we will work to expand theresearch infrastructure at Lummi Tribal Health Clinic and to increase research capacity in the tribalcommunity.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organizafion, city, state)University of Washington Office of Sponsored Programs, 1100 NE 45*'' Street, Suite 300, Seattle, WA. 98105University of Washington, Seattle, WA Indigenous Wellness Research Institute, School of Social Woric, 4101 15* Ave. NE, Seattle, WA. 9810pThe Lummi Tribal Healtb Health Clinic, Lummi Reservation, Bellingham, WAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Foiw Page 2342 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First Middle): Evans-Campbell, Teresa (Project #3)KEY PERSONNEL.

Our Committee on Undergraduate Research is chaired by Dr. Ari Kirshenbaum (VGN grant recipient) and Dr. Doug Green (BPI Coordinator) serves on it as well.  The Committee's goals include encouraging and recognizing student research and independent work to the fullest extent possible.  Initiatives sponsored by the Committee this year include:+\tUndergraduate Research Club:  The Undergraduate Research Club was chartered in the fall of 2008.  As a new member of our Student Association, the Club has spent its time this year working on developing its mission and its interest base among students.  There is more work for them to do, but student interest is reasonably high.+\tDeans Reception:  This year we will continue the practice, begun last year, of recognizing student work at our annual Dean's Reception.  At the Reception students will display posters and other forms of original scholarship for parents of and students on the Dean's List.+\tUndergraduate Research Symposium:   This year on April 29th Saint Michael's will host its first annual college-wide Student Research Symposium.  This all-day event will feature poster and oral presentations by students from all disciplines, detailing their research and other forms of scholarship.  Currently almost 150 students have signed up to present.The Vice President's office awarded 12 grants for undergraduates in various disciplines to perform research projects with a faculty mentor during the summer of 2009.  Approximately 12 additional students have received external funding for research projects this summer. On a related note, Saint Michael's will host the annual Sigma Xi induction dinner on April 21, 2009.  At this meeting, approximately 10-20 undergraduates from a variety of Vermont colleges will present a poster of their research and will be inducted into Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society.  The nominations are not all in so the identity of these students is not yet known, but historically many of them have received VGN funding.Faculty Engaged in Grant Review:Approximately a quarter of our faculty (10 of 39) served on review panels for grants, including:  Vermont Genetics Network, VT EPSCo\n",

      "Diabetic Uropathy is a term for a range of debilitating urologic complications such as bladder dysfunction,urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection and sexual dysfunction, that are among the most common andcostly, yet understudied complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), an incurable disease that affects at least 20million people in the U.S. and is rising in prevalence with the rapidly rising prevalence of obesity.Therapeutic options for diabetic uropathy are inadequate and have not improved over the last 50 years. Inresponse to RFA-DK-05-011, we propose to work with the Animal Models of Diabetic ComplicationsConsortium's organizational structure to function as the 'Diabetic Uropathy Pathobiology Site  to participatein development of two novel mice models of diabetic uropathy and to investigate the mechanisms of thepathophysiology of diabetic bladder dysfunction in these animals.Based on the observed temporal effects of diabetes on the bladder function in small animals, wehypothesize that depletion of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) specifically in smooth muscle ofadult mice will exacerbate accumulation of free radicals in smooth muscle during STZ-induced diabetesand accelerate the onset of the decompensated phase of diabetic bladder dysfunction. We hypothesizefurther that limiting depletion of MnSOD to arterial smooth muscle will have a lesser effect on STZ-induceddiabetic bladder dysfunction by limiting exacerbationof STZ-induced free radical accumulation to thevasculature. Depletion of MnSOD selectively in total and arterial smooth muscle in the MnSODlox/lox, SM-CreER12 mice and MnSODlox/lox, ASM-CreERT2 mice, respectively, will be accomplished by administrationof 4-hydroxytamoxifento activate Cre recombinase expressed in the smooth muscle. The animals will befurther treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment, and half of them will be injected with STZ to inducediabetes. The bladder function in the animals will be studied via four specific aims to examine: 1) thetemporal alterations in the in-vivo bladder function by micturition habits and conscious cystometry; 2) thetemporal course of morphological changes in diabetes-induced bladder hypertrophy; 3) temporalalterations in the contractile function of the detrusor muscle; 4) the temporal alterations in afferent andefferent autonomic pathways innervating the bladder.The Principal Investigator and the research team have a productive track record in being a part of theexisting AMDCC since 2003 and have functioned well under the auspices of the NIH, and the Steering andExternal Advisory Committees of the AMDCC.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of CWRU (CCLCM)9500 Euclid AvenueCleveland, Oh 44195PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Feldman, Eva L.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its metabolic derangements substantially affect the well-being of children.In order to define the nature, magnitude, and temporal evolution of the adverse effects of progressive CKD,we propose to extend the follow-up of the Prospective Study of the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children(CKiD) to determine (1) risk factors for accelerated decline; (2) factors contributing to abnormalities of growthand associated morbidity; (3) prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease; and (4) impact onneurocognitive abilities, social-behavioral functioning and quality of life. The CKiD is a cooperative effort of aData Coordinating Center, a Central Biochemistry Lab and two Clinical Coordinating Centers (CCC's) thatoversee subject recruitment and retention at 44 participating clinical sites in the US and Canada. Since studyinitiation in Oct 2003, we finalized and implemented a common protocol at 44 sites, met our recruitment goalof 540 children, aged 1 to <= 16 yrs with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30-90 ml/min/1.73m2formula and have successfully retained the cohort to date. At enrollment, 6 month and annual visitsthereafter, selected exposures are obtained on participants, including sociodemographic characteristics,family history, healthcare utilization, environmental exposures and medication use using standardizedquestionnaires. Standardized blood pressure, growth and nutritional assessments, metabolic status,measures of anemia, dyslipidemia, microinflammation, and proteinuria are also measured. Level of kidneyfunction (GFR) is measured annually for 2 years then every other year by plasma disappearance of iohexol.The primary outcomes of interest is the temporal evolution of subclinical measures and clinical eventsassociated with CKD progression as measured by decline in GFR, growth failure and its treatment,neurocognitive and behavioral deficits and cardiovascular disease, specified in our aims. Potential analysesthat will be conducted using the CKiD infrastructure to explore risk-factor disease relationships includetraditional prospective cohort analyses where putative risk factors are measured in participants at baseline;nested case-control studies in which laboratory studies are performed on stored baseline specimens incases (e.g.rapid progressors) and appropriately matched controls (e.g.non-progressors); and cross-cohortanalyses utilizing parallel cohorts.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MDMontefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NYWayne State University, Detroit, Ml Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, ILMt.

      "This K-23 award will provide an opportunity for Dr. Watkins to develop as an independent scientificinvestigator in the field of clinical and translational research, investigating the risk factors, and potentiallycausal factors, which explain the relationship between blood transfusion and trauma-associated acute lunginjury (ALI). This will be accomplished through an integrated curriculum consisting of coursework inepidemiology and biostatistics; intensive mentoring by local experts in the complications of severe trauma,ALI biology, and transfusion medicine; and practical experience in designing, conducting, and interpreting aclinical research project. Dr. Watkins will use this award to become an independently funded clinicalinvestigator with skills in advanced multivariate statistical methods and in the design of clinical andtransitional studies which include planned biologic sampling strategies necessary for biomarker discoveryand future gene expression studies. Moreover, he will gain an ability to design and implement clinicallyfocused projects which translate basic science advances into clinical practice, and also translate observedclinical associations into new basic science studies focusing on organ injury mechanisms. This will lead to asuccessful independent research career focused on understanding the clinical and biologic role of bloodtransfusion in the development of trauma-associated ALI and other trauma-related organ dysfunction. Theprimary scientific goal of this proposal is to determine the role of blood product storage time and cell-derivedmicroparticles in the development of trauma-associated ALI. To achieve this goal Dr. Watkins will: I.)establish the relationship between the storage time of transfused red blood cells and the development oftrauma-associated ALI in severely injured patients requiring transfusion, II.)compare the quantity of cell-derived microparticles within donor blood that is transfused to patients who subsequently develop, versus donot develop, trauma-associated ALI, and III.)obtain blood samples from a well-defined, severely injuredtrauma patient phenotype and: A.) use these samples to determine the associations between circulating cell-derived microparticles, transfusion, and trauma-associated ALI, and B.) establish an RNA repository fromcirculating leukocytes which will be archived for future studies aimed at identifying gene expression patternsassociated with blood transfusion and with trauma-associated ALI. This project has important implications forthose with severe trauma. The identification of potentially causal and modifiable factors important to thedevelopment of ALI could translate into novel biomarkers or new blood product storage, processing, ortransfusion guidelines. The goal of the microparticle studies is to reveal novel mechanisms of disease,opening new avenues for basic study. Finally, the identification of modifiable factors showing promise inpreventing trauma-associated ALI could be tested as interventions in future randomized clinical trials.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of WashingtonHarborview Medical CenterSeattle, WAPuget Sound Blood Center (Benaroya Research Institute)Seattle, WAPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Watkins, Timothy R.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF) is a unique, little-studied cytokine, whose relevance to the lungpathophysiology is unknown. Recent work by the PI has provided the first evidence of PBEF expression inlung tissues and overexpression in acute lung injury (ALI) as well as the association of PBEF geneticvariants with susceptibility to ALI. The haplotype weighted analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)T-1001G and C-1543T in the PBEF gene promoter revealed a susceptible haplotype GC with a 7.7-foldhigher risk of ALI. Reporter gene assays indicated that theses variants affected transcription rate. Our recentdata suggest that PBEF affects pulmonary endothelial cell permeability in vitro and increased pulmonaryedema in C57 BL/6 mice in vivo. In addition, stealth PBEF siRNA significantly inhibited TNF-alpha mediatedincrease ofIL-8 secretion, a known edematogenic factor in ALI, in pulmonary cells. All these results supportPBEF as a potential novel candidate gene and biomarker in ALI. To further detail underlying molecularmechanisms of PBEF in the pathogenesis of ALI, we hypothesize that patients with the genetically-determined susceptible haplotype in the PBEF promoter region are more susceptible to the upregulation bymechanical forces and inflammatory stimuli, two most inciting risk factors to ALI; increased PBEF expressioncontribute to the increased susceptibility to ALI by stimulating expression of other inflammatory cytokinessuch as IL-8, which leads to the pulmonary artery endothelial and epithelial cell barrier dysfunction andincreased pulmonary permeability, resulting in the pathogenesis of ALL The goal of this application is todefine the physiologic and molecular significance of the identified PBEF polymorphisms. Furthermore, wewill determine the pathophysiological role of PBEF in inflammatory lung injury with a specific focus on a roleof PBEF in increased lung vascular leak/permeability, a pathophysiological feature of ALI, both in tissueculture system in vitro and in Pbef gene knock out C57 BL/6 mice in vivo. Specific Aim #1 will functionallycharacterize PBEF gene promoter SNPs utilizing the reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.Specific Aim # 2 will examine the role of PBEF gene expression in endothelial cell barrier regulation andcontractility in vitro by evaluating endothelial cell transendothelial electric resistance, stress fiber formation,and phosphorylation of myosin light chains. Specific Aim #3 will define the signal transduction pathwaysofPBEF-mediated endothelial barrier regulation by examining PBEF- regulated genes and interacting partners.Specific Aim #4 will examine the in vivo role of PBEF in a murine model of ALI using Pbef knock out andover-expressing animals. Together, these novel and highly translational studies using the genomic andgenetic approaches will provide new insight into molecular mechanisms of PBEF function in ALI, which maylead to the development of novel diagnostic modalities and therapeutic strategies in ALI.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of ChicagoChicago, ILPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Ye, Shui Q.KEY PERSONNEL.

The Department of Health and Human Servicesimplemented the Executive Order through regulations at 45 CFR Part100 (Inter-governmental Review of Department of Health and HumanServices Programs and Activities). The objectives of the ExecutiveOrder are to (1) increase State flexibility to design a consultationprocess and select the programs it wishes to review, (2) increase theability of State and local elected officials to influence Federal decisionsand (3) compel Federal officials to be responsive to State concems, orexplain the reasons.The regulations at 45 CFR Part 100 were published in FederalRegister on June 24, 1983, along with a notice identifying theDepartment's programs that are subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372. Infonnation regarding PHS programs subject to Executive Order 12372is also available from the appropriate awarding office.States participating in this program establish State Single Points of Contact(SPOCs) to coordinate and manage the review and comment on proposed Federalfinancial assistance. Applicants should contact the Govemor's office forinfonnation regarding the SPOC, programs selected for review, and theconsultation (review) process designed by their State.Applicants are to certify on the face page of the SF-424 (attached) whether therequest is for a program covered under Executive Order. 12372 and, whereappropriate, whether the State has been given an opportunity to comment.Project Narrative File(s)* IWandatory Project Narrative File Filename: Project Narrative Foriti.pdfAdd.Ma^ridatory.PrpieciNarTative:File| peletejMandaltog_^Project:Narrat2ve^^ y'^yy_!^JPJ?J¿!y.LP!?J?p!:-^¿,r'!^*Ly^.^'^g,}To add more Project Nan^ative File attachments, please use the attachment buttons below.

      "Despite years of intense efforts to reduce the rates of preterm birth (PTB), our understanding of the underlyingmechanisms of PTB and racial disparity is limited. Recent data suggests that infection/inflammation has an important,complex role in early PTB. However, the mechanisms that modulate its clinical expression remain poorly understood.There is compelling evidence that PTB is a heterogenous complex entity determined by multiple genetic andenvironmental factors. Studies by our team have demonstrated a strong evidence of gene-environment interactionsonPTB in both Chinese and U.S.populations. This proposed study is to investigate the role of infection/inflammation,genetic susceptibility, and gene-environment interactions in determiningpreterm disparities among three racial groups(Black, White, and Hispanic) in the U.S. We hypothesize that the risk of PTB associated with infection/inflammation iselevated in individuals with the relevant variants of candidate genes: 1) those involved in the initiation and regulation ofinfectious/inflammatory process: Interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF); 2) those involvedmore distally in the cascade of inflammatory process that lead to PTB: corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH); 3) thosethat may modify infectious/inflammatory process: C-reactive protein (CRP) and protein C. We further hypothesize thatthe significant racial disparity in PTB may be partially explained by: 1) differences in allele frequencies of the abovecandidate genes; 2) differences in the prevalence of intrauterine infection/inflammation; and 3) differences in gene-infection and gene-environment interactions. We will utilize the existent epidemiologic and clinical data andbiospecimens from a total of 1,000 preterm mother-infant pairs (cases) and 2,000 term controls being collected at theBoston Medical Center. This proposal seeks support to accomplish two new specific aims: (1) to genotype the aboveproposed candidate genes for all the mothers and their infants in the study; and (2) to perform statistical analyses to testthe above hypotheses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that possesses technical and intellectualcapabilityand relevant experience to carry out the study. Another important strength of this proposal is the existent large multi-racial U.S. samples. The findings from this proposed study will expand our understanding of the role ofinfection/inflammation, genetic susceptibility, and gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of PTB and indetermining racial disparitiesin PTB.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Boston Medical Center/Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MassachusettsHarvard School of Public Health, Program for PopulationGenetics, Boston, MassachusettsKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The new CCTRT will serve as the academic home for research training for the ICTS. The CCTRT will buildseveral new research training programs including:¿ A PhD program in clinical investigation,¿ A training program for research nurses, coordinators and assistants,¿ A series of new pediatric clinical research training programs (Program Function 2.11) and¿ In collaboration with other CTSA Program Functions we will help develop new translational researchcurriculum (Biomedical Informatics 2.03, Biostatistics 2.04, Ethics 2.04, Community Engagement 2.07,Translational Pathology/Phenotyping Core 2.08, Human Imaging Unit 2.10, Brain, Behavior, PerformanceUnit 2.12, and Genetics/Genomics Core 2.13)A.1 Governance: The CCTRT will be governed by a newly formed Education Committee, which reportsto the ICTS Operations Committee. We will also develop a new Council of NIH-Funded TrainingPrograms to ensure collaboration between the core components of the CTSA, CCTRT and all the otherexisting training grants at WU, SLU and other institutional partners to share best practices, includingeducational resources and materials, curriculums, evaluation materials, minority recruitment strategies andmaterials to track trainees, mentors, faculty, and the training programs. The CCTRT will help overcomeacademic silos by bringing the organization, administration, and coordination of training programs together.This new Council will ensure that training grant directors from diverse disciplines work together to promote aninstitutional culture that rewards research mentoring, promotes more interaction between schools anddepartments and ensures equitable access to all ICTS resources.A.2 Vision: We believe that clinical investigators of the future require broad didactic training in clinical andtranslational research methods, clinical trials, epidemiology, biostatistics, health behavior, and ethics, as wellas various aspects of biomedical science. Specifically more training is needed to address the broad spectrumof both levels of translation (bench to bedside and bedside to community) including issues of Good ClinicalPractice, investigator sponsored vs. industry sponsored studies, entrepreneurial issues of intellectual propertydevelopment, recruitment and retention of research study participants, understanding and overcoming culturalPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page 612 Continuation Format PagePrincipal Investigator/Program Director.

Trainees also requiresuccessful and committed mentors and a supportive and nurturing environment. The leaders of the CCTRT areall successful clinical investigators who are known for their passion for training and mentoring. They have alldeveloped successful training programs and have collaborated on numerous projects in the past. Through theirleadership, commitment, and expertise, the CCTRT will provide an outstanding environment for researchtraining and mentoring.A.3 Interactions and Integration: The CCTRT will work closely with other CTSA Program Functions (NovelMethodologies and Pilot Studies, Biomedical Informatics, Biostatistics, Regulatory Knowledge and Support,Patient Interactions, and Community Engagement) to provide additional rich resources to support researchtraining. Diverse groups of faculty, mentors and scholars from different disciplines and all the ICTS ProgramFunctions will be woven together to facilitate training by providing didactic programs, mentored researchpracticums, and individual support services for trainees. The CCTRT will ensure extensive interactionsbetween faculty, mentors and trainees to develop functional and long-lasting mentoring relationships andresearch collaborations. The CCTRT will help provide a roadmap for trainees to access and benefit from all theProgram Functions of the CTSA. This will facilitate the research, education, and career development oftrainees and junior faculty. The new CCTRT represents a paradigm shift in the approach to research training atWU, SLU and the other institutional partners by formally integrating dozens of diverse programs into acohesive and supportive home designed to foster mentoring and research collaborations. This will ultimatelyimprove the efficiency and shorten the duration of research training.A.4 Promoting Diversity and Program Evaluation: The CCTRT will be structured to ensure successfulrecruitment, retention and promotion of under-represented minorities and women at all levels of training and toensure broad representation of scholars and leadership from multiple disciplines. Graduates will thus beequipped to apply an array of skills to the study of human disease and to appreciate the benefits of working inteams and collaborating with investigators from diverse disciplines. WU, SLU and the other institutionalpartners are diverse and complementary institutions that together provide a fertile setting for research training.The entire program, including the CCTRT, the Council of NIH-Funded Training Programs, mentors, faculty,trainees, and the curriculum, will be evaluated regularly, and these evaluations will be used to improve theprogram. Trainees will be tracked longitudinally for at least 10 years to monitor their employment, careerdevelopment, and milestones, including research, faculty appointments, grants, participation in study sections,publications, clinical workload, awards, and mentoring. The CCTRT will be evaluated by:¿ Tracking the number and types of trainees applying, accepted, matriculating, and completing training¿ Measuring trainee satisfaction with training programs and outcomes of the trainees (research productivity,publications, grants, academic appointments and promotions)¿ Reviewing faculty and mentors' teaching, mentoring and research productivity; and¿ Developing an external advisory board to critically review the Center, its programs, practices, and to makesuggestions for improvement.\n",

DONOT EXCEEDTHE SPACE PROVIDEDThe discounting of delayed reinforcers among the drug dependent has been increasingly studied. The results ofthat research are consistent and reflect an important dimension of drug dependence. Specifically, these studies haveshown that drug-dependent individuals discount money more than matched controls. Moreover, drug-dependentparticipants discount their drug of dependence more than they discount money. Ex-dependent or recently abstinentdrug users discount money either at a rate intermediate between current drug-dependent individuals and matchedcontrols, or at a rate that approximates discounting of the matched controls. Furthermore, reinforcing abstinencehas been shown to decrease the discounting of money and cigarettes in the drug dependent. Overall, these studiessuggest that drug-dependent individuals discount more than controls and the excessive discounting among the drugdependent may be a reversible effect of drug use. In this competing continuation, we propose to continue thisproductive research by addressing three specific aims. The first specific aim is to examine whether drug-dependentindividuals with co-morbidity discount delayed reinforcers more than individuals without that co-morbidity. Exp. 1will examine co-morbid substance dependence disorder by comparing the discounting of opioid-dependent cigarette smokers, opioid-dependent non-smokers, non-opioid-dependent smokers, and non-opioid- dependent,non-smoking matched controls. Exp.2 will examine a non-substance dependence co-morbid psychiatric disorder among cigarette smokers, namely, depression. Specifically, we will compare the discounting of depressed smokers, non-depressed smokers, depressed non-smokers, and non-depressed, non-smoking matched controls. The second specific aim is to extensively compare delay and probability discounting in smokers and non-smokers. A prior study reported that smokers did not differ from non-smokers on probability discounting. That prior report examined the discounting of money at only one magnitude. Exp.3 will systematically replicate and extend that prior study by examining and comparing delay and probability discounting. Specifically, we will compare those two types of discounting with several commodities, each at several magnitudes, in both smokers and matched controls. The third specific aim is to examine the relationship between discounting and abstinence. Previously we have shown that ex-smokers do not discount differently than non-smokers. Two hypotheses to explain that observation are (a) smokers who are successfully abstinent discounted less prior to the initiation of abstinence (less discounting leads to abstinence) and (b) abstinence leads to less discounting. These hypotheses may not be mutually exclusive. In Exp.4, we will examine whether individuals with proximate plans to quit cigarette smoking discount differently than both current smokers with no proximate plans to quit and ex-smokers. In Exp.5, we will follow up our initial observation regarding the effects of reinforced abstinence on discounting. Specifically, we propose to replicate and extend that observation with cigarette smokers by imposing and removing a contingency management procedure. If our prior work is replicated, then discounting should decrease when smoking abstinence is reinforced. We will extend that work by determining whether the decrease in discounting reverses when cigarette smokers relapse.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Vermont - Dept. of PsychiatryHuman Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory (HBPL)Ira Allen School - 38 Fletcher PlaceBurlington, VT 05401-1419University of Vermont - Dept. of PsychiatrySubstance Abuse Treatment Center (SATC) 1 South Prospect StreetBurlington, VT 05401-1195The Chittenden CenterUHC Room #1420 1 So.

Describeconcisely the research design and methods for achieving these goals. Avoid summaries of past accomplishments and the use of the first person. This descriptionis meant to serve as a succinct and accurate description of the proposed work when separatedfrom the application. If the application is funded, this description, asis, will become public information. Therefore, do not include proprietary/confidential information. DO NOT EXCEEDTHE SPACE PROVIDED. Our long-term goal is to understand how mutations to SOD can increase oxidative stress andcause the death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have shown thatendogenous formation of peroxynitrite by the diffusion-limited reaction between superoxide andnitric oxide induces apoptosis in cultured embryonic rat motor neurons deprived of trophic support.Both inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis as well as Cu.Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) deliveredintracellularly with liposomes protect motor neurons from apoptosis. These data indicate that theinteraction between nitric oxide and superoxide has a role in motor neuron apoptosis. Mutations toSOD are implicated in the selective degeneration of motor neurons in ALS and expression of ALS-SOD mutants in transgenic mice produces motor neuron disease. A common phenotype amongthe ALS-SOD mutations so far investigated is to decrease the affinity for zinc. We have shown thatzinc-deficient SOD is both less efficient at scavenging superoxide and a better catalyst of tyrosinenitration. Furthermore, the copper in zinc-deficient SOD can act as a non-specific one-electronoxidase, robbing electrons from antioxidants like ascorbate and glutathione that can be transferredto oxygen to produce superoxide. In the presence of NO, zinc-deficient SOD can catalyze theformation of peroxynitrite. In the previous cycle of funding, we have shown that zinc-deficient SODinduces apoptosis in motor neurons by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. For the renewal, ourfirst aim is to further investigate the mechanisms by which zinc-deficient SODs can kill culturedmotor neurons and to determine what can protect motor neurons from this toxicity. Our second aimis to characterize the source or sources of superoxide induced in motor neurons by trophic factorwithdrawal. Our third aim is to test the role of tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite in the death of motorneurons induced by either trophic factor deprivation or by zinc-deficient SOD. Completion of thespecific aims will provide a mechanistic basis for explaining how motor neurons are particularlyvulnerable to SOD mutations and establish a link between sporadic and familial SODs.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham,AlabamaKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Management ofthe Pilot and Feasibility ProgramThe Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research will support Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) studies in type II(bedside to practice and community) translation research. Investigators eligible for P&F studies include: a) newinvestigators without current or past NIH support as a principal investigator (PI), b) established, fundedinvestigators who have not previously worked in diabetes or diabetes-related areas, and c) establishedinvestigators in diabetes or diabetes-related areas with a proposal for testing the feasibility of a new, innovativeand/or collaborative idea that is both diabetes-related and represents a clear and distinct departure fromhis/her ongoing research interest. Applicants for P&F funding must be independent investigators (Instructorlevel or above at University of Chicago, or community partners with research careers) or be a member of theCenter from non-University of Chicago settings, and meet the NIH Eligibility Guidelines for P&F support. Thus,the P&F program supports the development of new investigators into fully independent scientists and seniorinvestigators in other fields to initiate a diabetes-related project, by providing funding to explore novel hypothesesand obtain preliminary data prior to the submission of an application for long-term support to the NIH, AmericanDiabetes Association, or other organization.Information about the current P & F program run by the DRTC is available at (http://drtc.bsd.uchiGago.edu)including instructions for application and list of previously funded applications. In addition to notifyinginterested investigators via the DRTC website, the Program Director sends an email to all Chicago CDTRmembers and all academic employees with advanced doctoral degrees in the clinical departments of theUniversity of Chicago Biological Sciences Division. The memorandum is also sent to the Deans of theBiological Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences, and to all Departmental Chairmen. Otherapproaches are undertaken to ensure that everyone possible knows of this funding opportunity. The Dean isrequested to inform the members of the Divisional Executive Committee, consisting of all Departmental andDivisional Committee Chairmen at their monthly meeting. Chairmen are encouraged to discuss the opportunityat departmental meetings and Center participants are encouraged to inform their colleagues ofthe program.To increase the impact of the P&F program and to foster increased inter-institutional research in Chicago,starting in 2005, solicitations for P&F proposals were sent to leading diabetes researchers at NorthwesternUniversity, University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University, Rush University, and the Illinois Institute ofTechnology. Research conducted solely at these institutions could be supported by this funding mechanism,although collaborative projects across institutions were strongly encouraged. The Chicago CDTR has steadilyincreased the number of investigators at institutions other than the University of Chicago.Some faculty are uncertain as to whether they should apply for these grants. They are directed to the P & FDirector or one of the Executive Committee, to clarify the issues e.g. eligibility, subject matter, budgetallocation, etc. This interactive process has proven to be most advantageous in terms of the Center'sreputation and in ensuring that the greatest number of faculty are encouraged to apply. Much information aboutthe Center is imparted to the University community. One of Dr. Peek's roles will be to represent the importanceof translational research in improving the care, outcomes, and prevention of diabetes.\n",

Exciting new findings and the enormous potential for powerful applications to human diseasecontinue to attract many of the best students to immunology. Increasingly, it is now possible to translate ourknowledge of immunity into manipulations of T cells and inflammation in clinical applications, and many ofthe next generation of immunologists will find rewarding careers in translational research. We believe thatthe best foundation for translational research is uncompromisingly rigorous traditional PhD training, with asolid basic science basis. Scientists trained in this way have been responsible for past gains in knowledgethat are now being translated into clinical applications, and will continue to play this role in the future.Nevertheless, we recognize that traditional PhD training can leave both a knowledge gap and amisunderstanding of the culture of clinical medicine that many scientists find difficult to overcome. Theseproblems limit entry of some of the best PhD scientists into translational research. Our program incorporatesseveral innovative features designed to help our trainees bridge this gap. The twenty-one mentors in ourprogram lead an interactive, interdepartmental reseach community that covers the full range of biomedicalscience from genomics and proteomics, intracellular signaling pathways, cell biology, microbiology, andcellular immunology to clinical studies and trials, all centered around regulation of inflammation and Tlymphocyte biology. In our program, students and postdoctoral fellows studying areas as distinct as vaccinedesign, immune evasion by viruses or bacteria, tumor immunology, immunopathology, transplantation, andautoimmunity benefit from learning about methods of investigation and advances in the other areas as partof this interactive research community. The goal of our program is to recruit talented and motivated studentsand post-doctoral fellows, provide them with a firm foundation in the latest techniques and concepts inbiomedical research, expose them to translational research opportunities, and foster precision, curiosity,daring, imagination, communication, and cooperation to give them the tools they need to direct independentresearch programs and train the next generation of biomedical scientists.Relevance: Many advances in treatment and prevention of human diseases depend upon advances inunderstanding how the body works and interacts with the environment. This program is designed to traineffective biomedical scientists who will become leaders in making new discoveries and will remain alert tothe Dossibilities of usina new knowledge to improve human health\n",

      "This training grant from the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy (CAGT) / Baylor College of Medicineprovides a comprehensive training program for both predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows withcareer research interests in cell and gene therapy - either its fundamental or clinical aspects, or both. Therationale is that a stimulating program of education and laboratory training from high quality mentors willattract promising candidates, including under-represented minorities, to this emerging field and increase thelikelihood of their pursuing careers as members of translational research teams. Translational research isincreasingly complex, and for advances to be efficiently implemented requires teams of investigators tocollaborate and develop novel strategies that can be validated in the clinic. This type of translationalresearch training requires the involvement of a dedicated team of mentors with diverse but complementaryskills. The proposed training takes advantage of the outstanding biomedical curricula and experiencedfaculty within the Baylor system and the CAGT. A cadre of 27 faculty members with research interests invector design and targeting, stem cell biology, molecular and cellular genetics, immunotherapy, gene therapyand stem cell transplantation, among other topics, will be available to mentor predoctoral students and bothMD and PhD postdoctoral fellows at any given time). Major strengths of the program are (1) its targeting ofrigorous basic biomedical science and clinical research training toward a translational goal; (2) its strongreliance on the proven scientific excellence of cell biology and genetics research training programs at Baylor,and (3) its involvement of mentors, including the program director and co-directors, who have a wealth ofexperience in translational research and in training young investigators (4) availability of unique resourcessuch as the GMP laboratories for training. Augmenting the formal course work and laboratory training will beopportunities to present recent research findings at annual retreats sponsored by the CAGT and academicdepartments within Baylor. During the first 4 years of funding this approach has successfully trained 8graduate students and 1 post doctoral fellows in translational cell and gene therapy research, all of whomare continuing in academic careers. The maintenance of support will allow us to continue to provide traineeswith a strong foundation for translational research careers in this emerging area.PERFORMANCE S1TE(S) (organization, city, state)Baylor College of MedicineHouston, TexasTexas Children's HospitalHouston, TexasThe Methodist HospitalHouston, TexasPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Heslop, Helen E.KEY PERSONNEL.

The goal of the Cancer Health Disparities Training Program at the University of North Carolina,Chapel Hill (UNC Chapel Hill) is to educate and train talented scientists to become future leaders in cancerhealth disparities research. Although cancer incidence and mortality have stabilized since the early 1990srates vary appreciably by race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. To be successful, strategiesand approaches to address and ultimately eliminate these disparities should be interdisciplinary andincorporate a broad spectrum of research skills. Therefore, the focus of the UNC Chapel Hill Cancer HealthDisparities Training Program will be to train public health researchers in the competencies needed toaddress and understand cross-cutting health disparity issues in cancer across the cancer continuum frometiology and primary prevention to survivorship. The program will be inclusive of the major cancers (lung,breast, colorectal, prostate, skin, and others) and cancer risk factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, obesity,tobacco, screening/early detection, and environmental exposures). Training will provide key educational and research knowledge necessary for the successful conductof cancer health disparities research, including genetic and molecular epidemiological bases of disparities;cancer epidemiology; research methods; cancer prevention and control (screening/early detection, healthpromotion, health communications, community-based participatory research, dissemination, policy);disparities related to access to care, socioeconomic status, culture, and survivorship; and critical thinkingand synthesis. Training for three postdoctoral fellows per year will be offered by four participatingdepartments in the UNC School of Public Health: Nutrition, Epidemiology, Health Behavior and HealthEducation, and Environmental Sciences and Engineering. The post-doctoral trainees will gain experienceand develop expertise in cancer health disparities research through a three-tier strategy; 1) a specializedcurriculum consisting of academic coursework, a field experience, journal club, seminars and conferences,and ethics and cultural competency training; 2) a hands-on research experience; and 3) career trajectorymentoring. Each trainee will have at least two mentors from different disciplines. Trainers will be leadingcancer disparities researchers from diverse and multiple disciplines drawn from various departments in theUNC School of Public Health and affiliated schools, centers, and institutes. A Training Advisory Committeecomposed of leaders across the participating departments will select trainees, monitor and evaluate theirprogress, and advice the Program Director and her Leadership Team.The combination of our experienced and diverse group of trainers, the unique and considerable institutionalstrengths of UNC Chapel Hill, and the wide-ranging proposed tralnmg plan provides an ideal and outstandingenvironment for a comprehensive program to train future leaders in cancer health disparities research.RELEVANCE (See instructions): PROjECTIPERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional~ProjecVPetformance Site Primary Location Organizational Name: University of North DUNS: 606195277 Street I: 2217 McGavran-GreenbergCity: Chapel Hill Province:\n",

DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACEPROVIDED.Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease that usually progresses to liver failureand death unless liver transplantation is performed. Although the etiology of PBC is not well understood,both genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute. Recent clinical studies strongly suggest thatinfection with Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (N. aro) is specifically associated with development of PBCin predisposed individuals. Utilizing a mouse model, we have recently shown that N. aro infection of miceresults in the development of PBC-like liver lesions, which are dependent upon the production of IFN-¿ andIL-17 through activation of NKT and conventional T cells. Based on our preliminary data that NOD miceexpressing the B6 CD101 allele or mice deficient in CD101 expression exhibit more severe PBC than theircongenic or wildtype littermates, we propose that the CD101 gene, which lies within the Idd10 diabeteslocus, that encodes the expression of the negative co-stimulatory molecule is a novel PBC susceptibilitygene. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role of CD101 in susceptibility/resistance tosevere PBC. Although the exact mechanisms by which CD101 susceptibility alleles regulate T cell activationand PBC are unknown, our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that diminished/altered signaling bythe B6 CD101 allele on the NOD background mediates enhanced T cell signals through Vav3 activationand/or lack of PTPN22 induction that impair the balance between regulatory and effector T cells and leads toenhanced inflammation and liver disease. To test this hypothesis, we aim to: 1) further explore the role ofCD101 in the acute and chronic phases of N. aro-induced PBC; 2) determine whether genetic differences inCD101 increase DC-mediated activation of NKT and/or conventional T cells, and, thereby susceptibility tothe chronic phase of disease; and 3) determine whether the differential regulation of T cell function in B6CD101 congenic mice results from alterations in CD101-mediated regulation of Vav3 and/or PTPN22.Identification of CD101 as a susceptibility gene for PBC should provide valuable insight into the developmentof novel therapeutics to treat this life-threatening disease, but may also allow the identification of commontargets in autoimmune disease for clinical intervention in the future.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Children's Hospital Medical Center Cincinnati, OHKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and disease in the knee is a leading cause of disability. Most epidemiologic studies of knee OA have focused on radiographic disease, but symptomatic OA should be a major focus of studies on preventing OA, because symptomatic disease causes disability and has formidable societal and public health impacts. OA is potentially preventable, but only a limited number of mostly nonmodifiable risk factors has been identified, even though modifiable risk factors such as particular activities, muscle weakness, proprioceptive deficits, micronutrient deficiencies and structural factors have been proposed and may affect substantially the risk of disease. Prevention opportunities are most relevant and are most likely to be used by those who already have disease or who are at highest risk of getting it. This proposal introduces four new approaches into the epidemiologic study of knee osteoarthritis: l.a focus on symptomatic disease, 2. a comprehensive evaluation of risk factors including modifiable ones, 3. a focus on those who would really benefit from prevention opportunities, those who already have disease or those who are at high risk of getting it and 4. the incorporation of more comprehensive and reproducible imaging than has previously been used including, state of the art radiographic techniques and MRI. MRI provides rich information on structural factors in which abnormalities may affect the risk of disease. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate longitudinally the effects of three groups of factors: biomechanical factors (squatting,kneeling, stair climbing, quadriceps weakness and proprioceptive deficits), bone and structural factors (bone density,bone marrow and meniscal lesions on MRI) and micronutrient deficiencies (vitamin C, E and D) on the occurrence and progression of symptomatic and radiographic knee OA in a population-based sample of men and women aged 50 to 79. We propose to recruit a community-based sample of 3,000 men and women likely to either have knee OA or be at high risk of OA. High risk groups will include those who are overweight, those with knee symptoms or those with a history of knee injuries or operations. Subjects will be evaluated with symptom questionnaires, radiographs and MRI's and will be followed 36 months for the development or progression of symptomatic or radiographic OA. Analyses will focus on the relation of these important risk factors and OA outcomes. This large, multifaceted and comprehensive study of persons with knee OA, or at high risk of disease, offers to address definitively the relation of potentially important risk factors to the development or progression of a major disabling disease and to provide new insights into disease biology and potential opportunities for prevention.Boston University Medical Campus715 Albany Street, Rm.

The faculty comprise a multi-disciplinary vision sciences research community encompassing the Departments of Biomedical Engineering,Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Neurosciences, Ophthalmology & VisualSciences, Pathology and Pharmacology. Expansion of capabilities and productivity in the field of visionresearch has led to its selection as a priority in strategic planning at CWRU. The momentum behind theexpansion of the NEI Core grant-supported Visual Sciences Research Center has produced a dramaticincrease in the number of vision scientists and extramural support for their research. This atmosphereaffords an ideal training opportunity for vision scientists.The Visual Sciences Research Center and collaborative research of its participating faculty provides anoverall framework for the Visual Sciences Training Program. In addition, as vision research has expanded atCWRU, there has been a natural evolution of five research/training groups that have distinct identities butalso considerable overlap among participants. This Institutional Training Grant renewal application isorganized around the five thematic (a) Retinal Development and Disease, (b) Phototransduction, (c) Agingand Diabetes in the Eye, (d) Ocular Inflammation and Infection, and (e) Translational Visual Sciences.Continued support is requested for six predoctoral student positions and two postdoctoral positions in allyears. The demands of our program are such that only students of the highest potential are admitted.Students will receive training in department-specific, vision research theme-specific, and laboratory-basedsettings. Collectively, this approach will ensure that our trainees will be able to pose biologically andclinically relevant questions in visual science research without being restricted by either discipline ormethodology.The training program is supported by the resources of the 23 vision scientists, 9 accessory faculty, the Coremodules of the Visual Science Research Center, and the broader resources of Case Western ReserveUniversity, University Hospitals of Cleveland and the VA Medical Center.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Twenty-three scientists in the Visual Sciences Research Center at CWRU seek continued support for aVisual Sciences Training Program.

ClayPROJECT SUMIVIARY (See instructions): This application seeks five years' continued funding for a training program supporting four predoctoral students andone postdoctoral student with the aim of producing independent investigators capable of sustaining productive researchprograms in the vision sciences. The program is designed for training students in the areas of molecular/cellularbiology, genetics, biochemistry, and immunology w^ith particular focus on training in vision research. Preceptors havebeen selected with an emphasis both on the productivity of their current research and on their training records. Thetraining program is organized to rigorously instruct and reinforce skills pertinent to experimental science and involves acombination of coursework, independent research, oral presentations (in-house, national and international), writtenresearch proposals, and the sharpening of communicative skills through continuous mentor feedback and peer review. The program is interdisciplinary and utilizes a core group of ten preceptors with active research and trainingprograms whose primary and joint appointments span five basic science departments at the University of FloridaCollege of Medicine. All predoctoral students are admitted through a common College-wide graduate trainingprogram, the Interdisciplinary Program in Biomedical Sciences (IDP), and follow a common first year core curriculum.The Department of Ophthalmology serves as the administrative and logistical center for the NEI training program, butindividual faculty preceptors maintain primary graduate training appointments in the Departments of Anatomy and CellBiology, Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Neuroscience, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Pharmacology. TheDepartment of Ophthalmology adds depth to the program by providing exposure to current problems in clinicalophthalmology in order to acquaint the graduate and postdoctoral student with relevant clinical issues in vision. Overallwe propose an integrated program of research training in key biological disciplines aimed at producing productivevision researchers.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Blinding diseases are some of the most devastating health concerns in the United States. This trainingprogram seeks to produce young scientists with independent and productive programs in the visionsciences. These new scientists are expected to generate discoveries in the underlying mechanisms of visionand associated pathologies, and to help develop treatments for these diseases\n",

Axonal connectivity is a key relationship that facilitates informationtransmission and reception within the CNS. Recently, diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) methods have been shown to provide fundamental information required for viewing structuralconnectivity and have allowed visualization of fiber bundles in the CNS in vivo. In this project, we propose todevelop methods for extraction and analysis of these patterns from high angular resolution diffusion weightedimages (HARDI) that is known to have better resolving power over diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).To this end, a biologically relevant and clinically important model has been chosen to study changes in theorganization of fibers in the intact and injured spinal cord. Our hypothesis is that, changes in geometricalproperties of the anatomical substrate, identifying the region of injury and neuroplastic changes indistant spinal segments, correlate with different magnitudes of injury and levels of locomotorrecovery following spinal cord injury (SCI). Prior to hypothesis testing, we will denoise the HARDI dataand then construct a normal atlas cord. Deformable registration and tensor morphometry between a normalatlas and an injured cord would be performed to provide a distinct signature for each type of behaviorrecovery associated with the SCI substrate. Validation of the hypothesis will be performed through systematichistological analysis of cord samples following acquisition of the HARDI data. Spinal cords will be cut andstained with fiber and cell stains to verify changes in anatomical organization that result from contusive injury(common in humans as well) to the spinal cord. A comparison between anatomical characteristics obtainedfrom histological versus HARDI analysis will provide validation for the image analysis and the hypothesis.Three severities of spinal cord injuries will be produced (light, mild and moderate contusions) based uponnormed injury device parameters. The structural signatures of these labeled data subsets will then beidentified. Automatic classification of novel & injured cord HARDI data sets will then be achieved using a largemargin classifier. Finally, HARDI data acquired over time will be analyzed in order to learn and predict thelevel of locomotor recovery by studying the structural changes over time and developing a dynamic model ofstructural transformations corresponding to each chosen class. We will use an auto-regressive model in thefeature space to track and predict structural changes in SCI and correlate it to functional recovery.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of Florida, Gainesville, FloridaPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page Form Page 2\n",

Our lab has identified FoxJ1 as a new transcription factor involved in late stage toothand craniofacial morphogenesis. FoxJ1 (also known as HFH-4, FHKL-13) belongs to the fork-head family ofgenes, containing a fork-head (also known as winged helix) DNA binding domain is known to regulatedevelopment via cell fate determination. Our preliminary data reveals FoxJ1 expression in the mouse molarinner dental epithelium from E18.5 onwards and in the pre-ameloblasts and odontoblasts during neonateday 1. It is also expressed in the oral epithelium and sub-mandibular salivary gland during E17.5 andneonate day 1. Our transient transfection data indicates that FoxJ1 is activated by, and also physicallyinteracts with PITX2, a homeobox transcription factor gene involved in early craniofacial/tooth development.The overall goal of this proposal is to test our hypothesis that FoxJ1 plays a role in cytodifferentiation ofameloblasts and odontoblasts during tooth development using mouse genetics. We will test our hypothesisthat PITX2 regulates FoxJ1 expression in concert with other transcription factors during tooth development.Moreover, FoxJ1 physically interacts with PITX2 and auto-regulates its promoter in a positive feed backfashion. We will test our hypothesis that FoxJ1 interacts with PITX2 and other tooth specific transcriptionfactors to regulate late bell and pre-secretory stages of tooth development.The identification of new genesinvolved in craniofacial/tooth development will increase our knowledge about the basic developmentprograms required for normal embryogenesis. Understanding how these components interact to promotenormal craniofacial development will further our understanding of genetic defects. We canthen promote methodologies to inhibit severe craniofacial anomalies.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Texas A&M Health Science Center, Institute for Biosciences and Technology, Houston, TXPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2\n",

A family of GPCRsthat mediates the action of acetylcholine includes five members called muscarinic receptors (M1R-M5R).These receptors are implicated in a number of neurological disorders including depression, Alzheimer's andParkinson's diseases. The activity and subcellular localization of GPCRs are controlled by a number ofintracellular proteins. This proposal concentrates on understanding the regulation of type 3 muscarinicreceptor (M3R) by a neurospecific regulator of G protein signaling (RGS), the Gbeta5-RGS7 complex.Recent original findings in this laboratory show that Gbeta5-RGS7 complex can inhibit M3R signaling via anovel mechanism that involves direct binding between M3R and RGS7. M3R activation also causes adramatic change in subcellular localization of the Gbeta5-RGS7 complex. These phenomena occur in anM3R-selective manner. Furthermore, studies of mice lacking Gbeta5 revealed their similarity to mice lackingM3R. This project will test the hypothesis that the Gbeta5-RGS7 complex regulates M3R signaling via anovel mechanism and/or transfers signals from M3R to intracellular compartments in neurons. Specific Aim 1will determine structural elements of M3R and RGS7 that are involved in this interaction. Dominant mutantsof M3R and RGS7 will be used as molecular tools in Specific Aims 2 and 3. In addition, a series of in vitroassays will be used to study the relationship between the Gbeta5-RGS7 complex and other binding partnersof M3R. Aim 2 will study subcellular relocalization of M3R and Gbeta5-RGS7 from the cytosol to endosomalvesicles. The experiments will use advanced imaging methodology, cell fractionation and biochemicalapproaches to identify subcellular compartments where M3R and Gbeta5-RGS7 re-localize upon receptoractivation and search for novel binding partners of this protein complex. Aim 3 will explore the physiologicsignificance of M3R:Gbeta5-RGS7 interaction in native cells. The experimental design is based on thediscovery that Gbeta5 knockout mice have an increased level of epinephrine, which is consistent with highlocomotor activity and other changes in these animals. The proposed study will concentrate on the analysisof catecholamine secretion by chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla from Gbeta5 knockout mice.Experiments will also investigate the neuroendocrine PC12 cell lines with altered expression of Gbeta5-RGS7 and will utilize imaging and biochemical methods. This research will result in better understanding ofregulation of neuronal muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and illuminate novel roles of RGS proteins inregulation of signal transduction and other cellular functions.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FLKEY PERSONNEL.

The long-term objective of the proposed grant is to develop an integrated multimodal intravascularimaging system that combines ultra high-resolution intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT), andintravascular ultrasound (IVUS). This combined multimodal vascular imaging system will permit cross-sectional visualization of vascular arteries with high spatial resolution, broad imaging depth, and highsensitivity not possible with any of these technologies alone. The specific aims of the proposal are to design,development, and optimize an integrated intravascular OCT/US system, and to test and demonstrate in vivointravascular imaging in animal model and pilot human subject studies. OCT and IVUS provide complementary information for vascular imaging applications. First, OCT & IVUSprovide details of the imaged tissue at two different length scales. IVUS resolution is in the order of 50microns to 200 microns, while OCT images provide details at a much higher resolution in the order of 5microns to 20 microns. Therefore, IVUS can image a much larger area to choose a suspect lesion or aregion in the blood vessel lumen wall, while OCT can be used to see details in the suspect area. Second,OCT has a limited imaging depth of 2 mm, while IVUS can image depth > 5mm inside the tissue. Third, theimaging contrasts for IVUS and OCT are different. Recent clinical studies that combines OCT/IVUS dataanalysis shows that neither modality alone is sufficient for detecting thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) (Sawadaet al. European Heart Journal 29:1136-1146). Their results indicate that combined use of OCT and IVUSoffers a promising approach for evaluating TCFA. The complementary nature of OCT/IVUS may enableearly detection and classification of plaques, identification of stent struts and stent mal-opposition,characterization of vessel dimension and detection of post stent thrombosis. The proposed research requires an interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and clinicians. Wehave assembled such a team that involves the collaboration of four investigators from three institutions:Optical coherence tomography imaging group (Dr. Chen from Beckman Laser Institute at UCI), Ultrasoundimaging group (Dr. Zhou and Shung from the NIH Transducer Resource Center at USC), and Intravascularcardiology group (Dr. Narula from the Dept. of Cardiology at UCI). Each principal investigator has expertisein the key areas required for the success of this project. In preliminary studies conducted at the UCI Beckman Laser Institute and the USC NIH TransducerResource Center, we have shown that it is possible to combine OCT and IVUS in a single probe. Theintegrated probe has the advantage of high resolution and broad imaging depth. The proposed research isto extend this finding and to develop and translate this technology from bench top to clinical applications.PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Form Page 2\n",

DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACEPROVIDED.Allergic asthma is a chronic disease which has been on the rise in recent decades. Although the etiology ofasthma is not well understood, it is currently thought to arise as a result of inappropriate CD4+Th2-mediatedinflammatory responses to airborne allergens in susceptible individuals. Despite extensive investigation, theexact mechanisms responsible for the initiation of Th2 (IL-13) immune responses in asthmatic individuals areunknown. The initiation and maintenance of Th2 immune responses are dependent upon specific activationof dendritic cells at the airway surface. Recent evidence suggests that specific subsets of dendritic cells(DCs) are critical for the initiation of allergic airway responses and play an important role in driving eitherimmunity (myeloid, mDCs) or tolerance (plasmacytoid, pDCs) to inhaled antigens. However, themechanisms by which specific DC subsets are recruited to the lung and activated in response to allergenexposure are unknown. Our preliminary data collectively upport the novel hypothesis that the commonallergen, house dust mite, triggers the rapid release of the immature dendritic cell chemoattractant, CCL20,from its storage sites on the extracellular matrix molecule syndecan-1, through the activation of dectin-1, apattern recognition molecule which recognizes beta-glucans. CCL20 once released drives the preferentialrecruitment and activation of the immunogenic myeloid dendritic cell subset which in turn directs Th2 celldifferentiation and the development of allergic inflammation. Moreover, IL-13 itself can induce the release ofCCL20 from the airway epithelium providing an amplication loop for continued Th2 cytokine production. Themolecular mechanisms driving epithelial CCL20 release from syndecan, the mechanisms of preferentialrecruitment and activation of mDCs by CCL20/syndecan-1, the mechanisms by which IL-13 induces CCL20release and perpetuates dendritic cell recruitment into the lung, and the exact contributions of thesepathways to allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation are unknown. Thus wepropose the following specific aims to test this hypothesis and define the molecular mechanisms underlyingallergen-induced induction of Th2 cytokine production: 1)To determine the role of dectin-1 signalingpathways in the HDM-induced release of syndecan-1/CCL20 complexes from the surface of airway epithelialcells; 2) To determine the mechanism by which syndecan-1 regulates dendritic cell conditioning of T cell IL-13 production in vitro and in vivo; 3)To determine the mechanisms by which IL-13 perpetuates therecruitment of immunogenic DC subsets and further Th2 cytokine production. Collectively, the results ofthese studies should provide a better understanding of the mechanisms driving Th2 (IL-13) cytokineproduction and may lead to the development of novel asthma therapies which are disease modifying ratherthan ameliorative.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Children's Hospital Medical Center Cincinnati, OHKEY PERSONNEL.

      "Paramyxoviruses are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Measles virus (MV), amember of the paramyxovirus family, accounts for approximately 600,000 deaths annually and is among theten most lethal human pathogens. The virus is endemic in Africa, Asia and parts of Europe, and subject tofrequent importation to the US. A herd immunity of approximately 95% is required to suppress periodicoutbreaks. Despite high vaccination coverage in the US, cases are reported annually. No therapy isavailable for management of severe cases or rapid control of local outbreaks. It is therefore the long-termobjective of this project to develop applicable antivirals that inhibit MV. Towards this goal a new class of small molecule MV fusion inhibitors has been identified that show strongpromise as drug candidates. We propose structure-based design, pharmacophore extraction, quantitativestructure-activity relationship (QSAR)-direeled optimization and efficacy testing to develop this compoundclass to a therapeutic lead. To maximize the prospect of success and counteract viral resistance that may emerge in the field, additional, structurally unrelated drug candidates will be identified in parallel. The first specific aim is therefore to biochemically assess the target site of the fusion inhibitors and develop a three- dimensional structure-based pharmacophore. Covalent photoaffinity labeling of the target protein by radiolabeled inhibitor analogs will be combined with protein microsequencing to define the physical binding site. The second specific aim identifies new hits through two complementary approaches: structure-guided database mining of available chemicals and high throughput screening using fluorescent MV as reporter. The third specific aim develops the fusion inhibitors and selected new hits to therapeutic leads through iterative rounds of QSAR-guided chemical modification and biotesting. Prior to lead development, new hits will be mechanistically characterized. The fourth specific aim is to assess the activity of selected leads against a representative panel of primary MV isolates that are frequently imported into the US and evaluate the efficacy of identified drug candidates in vivo using the cotton rat small animal model. Characteristic viral escape patterns will be identified for efficacious compounds that warrant future clinical development, and cross-resistance between structurally distinct therapeutic leads will be assessed.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Emory University, Atlanta, GAOhio State University, Columbus, OHPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Plemper, Richard KarlKEY PERSONNEL.

      "About 20 million Americans have kidney disease. The number of people diagnosed with kidney disease hasdoubled each decade for the last two decades impacting on human suffering and enormous Medicare costsimposed by end-stage renal failure. Renal ultrafiltration is located within the renal glomerulus and performedby highly specialized podocyte cells. Podocyte foot processes (FPs) and the interposed slit diaphragms(SDs) cover the outer aspect of the glomerular filtration barrier and form a final barrier to protein loss.Damage of podocytes results in proteinuria and may lead to progressive decline of renal function. It istherefore in the interest of the public health to define the regulation of podocyte structure and function at thecellular and molecular levels and identify molecular targets involved in early structural changes leading topodocyte damage and the development of proteinuria.We have made the novel finding that cathepsin L enzyme is present within the cytoplasm of podocytesduring nephrotic syndrome and cleaves CD2AP, an important SD protein. Cathepsin L is a lysosomalprotease that has a broad biological significance such as intracellular protein degradation, activation ofenzyme precursors, and tumor invasion. Normally located in lysosomes, cathepsin L can be found in thecytoplasm or can be secreted under certain conditions. We have developed a novel murine model oftransient nephrotic syndrome that shares key features with human nephrotic syndrome which allows us todelineate proteolytic processes in podocytes resulting from the induction of cathepsin L.We propose 3 Specific Aims to unravel the function of extralysosomal cathepsin L expression and activity inpodocytes. In the first Specific Aim, we propose to analyze the course and severity of proteinuria in micelacking cathepsin L and how the lack of this enzyme affects CD2AP binding interactions with other SDproteins. We will then test the hypothesis in detail that the SD protein CD2AP is a proteolytic target protein ofcathepsin L and explore the cell-junction stability of cathepsin L cleavage resistant CD2AP mutants (SpecificAim 2). In Specifc Aim 3, we will address the biological significance of cleaved CD2AP fragments andanalyse the effects of such peptides on the actin based lysosomal degradome using organellar proteomics.The proposed role of proteolytic processing of podocyte structural and regulatory proteins during nephroticsyndrome represents a novel concept in the molecular work-up of proteinuria.If our hypothesis is correct, our work will have broad significance for the basic understanding of glomerularpathology e.g. the mechanism of podocyte FP effacement. Uncovering the role of podocyte proteolysis willhelp to develop novel pharmaco-therapeutics (such as cathepsin L resistant CD2AP mutants or smallmolecules blocking CD2AP cleavage) to tackle proteinuria and progression of glomerular disease.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MassachusettsHarvard Medical School- Partners Healthcare Center for Genetics and GenomicsPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): REISER, JochenKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The original project was GM 068968, responding to Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research inMathematical Biology, PA NSF 02-125. This competing renewal application is continues to propose newmathematical innovations in biomedical computational science and technology. Modeling thepharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) behavior of drugs has serious statistical flaws. ThePK/PD community still uses mainly parametric methods of modeling based on approximate likelihoods, withno guarantee that studying more subjects will obtain parameter estimates closer to the true values (theyoften get worse). In contrast, our laboratory has developed methods, both parametric (P) and nonparametric(NP), which are statistically consistent. However, there is still no way to obtain rigorous confidence intervals on P or NP parameter estimates. This is a great weakness. Also, current dosing policies are basedonly on information available now, though we know we will monitor the patient and adjust dosage in thefuture. These known future actions are ignored. Our aims are (1) TO DEVELOP A NEW SEQUENTIALBAYESIAN METHOD FOR MAKING PK/PD POPULATION MODELS. We propose an exciting newmethod to obtain rigorous confidence intervals for parameter estimates for both P and NP population PK/PDmodels. It is an outgrowth of our previous work in GM 068968. It should also provide rigorous confidenceintervals on a clinician's ability to hit a desired therapeutic target serum concentration. This will provide a firmmathematical foundation for all population modeling, and for our current work to optimize coordinatedcombination drug therapy for which we have recently been funded under grant EB 005803. It is alsosequential, and thus permits new subjects to be added to a model rather than having to remake it fromscratch. This will greatly aid community hospitals to add their own patients to the original model as desired.(2) TO CONTINUE WORK ON OUR ACTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY TO OPTIMIZE LEARNING ABOUTTHE PATIENT WHILE TREATING HIM/HER AT THE SAME TIME. Current dosage regimens use onlyinformation available up to now. We know we will monitor the patient and adjust dosage in the future. This isignored. The dosage regimen is not designed to aid in learning about the patient. We now propose to usethe dosage regimen as an active partner in the learning process, by calculating how far (and safely) onecan deviate a bit from the target goal to probe the patient's system thoughtfully to learn more about it, andthus to maximize therapeutic precision over the projected duration of therapy. We propose to explore futureclinical scenarios in advance, now. Our approach is to approximate the Stochastic Dynamic Programming(SDP) equations of Bellman using the IPS (Iteration in Policy Space) algorithm, and a Particle Filter to solvethe underlying nonlinear estimation problem. This should make patient care still more intelligent and optimal.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CaliforniaPHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Jelliffe, Roger WoodhaiDKEY PERSONNEL.

This appears to be related to actions at GAB\\A receptors since these miceare supersensitive to allosteric GABAA receptor agonists, including ethanol., in vivo and in vitro. The overallgoal of this project is to understand how PKCe regulates GABAA receptor function. Studies will useimmunohistochernistry and receptor binding autoradiography to compare the distribution of specific GABAAreceptor subunits in wild type and PKce null mice: Autoradiography will also be us.ed to determine the affinityand density of binding sites for ligands that bind to benzodiazepine sites on specific: receptor subpopulations.Western analysis will be used to measure the abundance of receptor subunits in limbic brain regions that expressPKCE. L(tk-) fibroblast cell lines expressing different types of receptors will be examined to determine if PKCeregulation of allosteric sensitivity is specific for a particular subunit combination. Finally a PKCe mutant thatcan utilize novel ATP analogs as phosphate donors will be used to identify immediate substrates of PKCe inL(tk-) cells and in synaptoneurosomes, using immunoprecipitations with antibodies to GABAA receptor subunitsand associated proteins, and 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry for unknown substrates.

      "PTEN is a tumor suppressor that is mutated in many forms of human cancer. PTEN encodes aphosphatase that recognizes the important second messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (Pl-3,4,5-P), and removes the 3'-phosphate from the inositol ring. PTEN therefore antagonizes PI-3 kinase,which phosphorylates the inositol ring at the same position. PI-3 kinase is an oncogene in its own right thatis frequently mutated and amplified in tumors. Although PI-3 kinase and PTEN potentially influence manysignaling pathways, perhaps the best understood pathway involving these genes is the insulin/IGF pathway,which is conserved in homo sapiens, c. elegans and drosophila. In these species, PTEN acts downstreamof the insulin/IGF receptor, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) adaptor and PI-3 kinase and upstream of AKTkinase. The most significant targets of AKT are the FOXO transcription factor genes. Activation of the PI-3kinase pathway is highly oncogenic; however, it remains unclear how many components of the pathwaycontribute to oncogenesis. This application will focus on three fundamental problems in understanding howthe PI-3 kinase pathway drives tumor formation. In aim 1, we will explore the possibility that pathologicalover expression of IRS2 in tumors can stimulate PI-3 kinase and collaborate with other alterations on the Pl-3 kinase pathway to boost the PI-3 kinase signal. We will introduce IRS2 into normal human cells andexamine them for alterations in growth, differentiation, and signaling. The minimal domain that is competentfor inducing signaling and altered growth will be defined. We will measure the frequency of over expressionin tumors and measure the effect of RNAi on tumor cell line growth and signaling. Lastly, we will establish atransgenic model of IRS2 overexpression to test the hypothesis that it is an oncogene . In aim 2, we willdetermine the effect of PTEN dose on tumor formation in mice. Loss of one copy of PTEN and reducedPTEN protein expression are extremely common in human malignancy. We therefore will reduce expressionof PTEN in mice using RNAi and examine its effect on tumor formation. In aim 3, we will investigate howPTEN regulates FOXO transcription factors to activate a target gene. DNA elements will be identified on thepromoter that coordinate gene activation. A combination of overexpression, RNAi, and chromatin immuno-precipitation experiments are planned to identify the mechanism of activation.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Health Sciences DivisionColumbia University630 West 168th StreetNew York, NY 10032PHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): ParSOOS, Ramon EKEY PERSONNEL.

      "This proposal describes a 5-year training program for the candidate, Catherine Hagan, D.V.M., to become an independent investigator in comparative experimental neuropathology. She is pursuing a Ph.D. in the Molecular and Cellular Biology graduate program at the University of Washington, Seattle; her dissertationwork focuses on mechanisms of extracellular serotonin regulation in the brain. With this SERCA, Dr.Hagan will build on her foundation in brain serotonin biology to investigate serotonergic immunomodulation of microglial-mediated neuroinflammation with co-mentor Dr. John Neumaier, M.D., Ph.D., co-mentor Dr. Tom Montine, M.D., Ph.D., and collaborator Dr. Thomas Moller, Ph.D. Their combined expertise in serotonin pharmacology, neuropathology, and microglial biology is a unique feature of the rich training environment at the University of Washington. Career development activities will include specialized courses, such as the Molecular Neuropathology course at Cold Spring Harbor, and regular didactic activities such as a journal clubs focused on microglial biology, inflammation, and neuroscience. Microglia are the immune system of the brain and are critically involved in responses to injury and variousdiseases. These responses can be either beneficial or detrimental. Conditions leading to thesedichotomous responses are poorly understood. The long term goal of the proposed research is tounderstand how serotonin and serotonin receptor mediated signaling between neurons and microglia contribute to pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases. Aim 1 focuses on how the serotonin signal tomicroglia may be disrupted by inflammation. Rotating disk voltammetry will be used to study whether stimulating cerebral innate immunity in vivo alters neuronal serotonin transporter kinetics. This may be an underlying mechanism for how changes in serotonin lead to changes in microglial function. Aim 2 exploresthe possibility that microglia have an important functional capacity to take up serotonin and the mechanisms by which occurs. Aim 3 focuses on microglial serotonin receptor expression and function. Results will be used to test the hypothesis that impaired serotonergic neurotransmission and signaling potentiates microglial-mediated neurotoxicity. Immunomodulation of microglia has the potential to improveclinical outcomes in a variety of disorders, including neuroinflammatory disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic pain disorders. Accomplishing the aims of the proposed studies will determine iftargeting serotonin signaling between neurons and microglia offers a new therapeutic approach to neuroinflammation through modulation of microglial responses to injury.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)The University of Washington, Seattle, WA 1.

      "Population divergence, including speciation and the origins of population structure, is the fundamentalevolutionary process leading to the diversity of life. This research project will extend recent advances in alikelihood-based approach to divergence models. The new approach employs analytic integration over priorditributions of model parameters within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. The method leads to a jointprobability density function, proportional to the likelihood, that can be used for parameter estimation and log-likelihood ratio tests of nested demographic models.The new method will be adapted to general multi-population problems in divergence. Such problems havelong been appreciated as requiring both a population genetic perspective and a phylogenetic perspective. Theresearch plan outlines how these two can be brought together under a common MCMC simulation. This willbe the first such method that does not assume a given phylogeny; that does not assume that gene flow has notoccurred; and that makes no assumptions about the relative population sizes of sampled or ancestralpopulations. By providing estimates of the joint posterior density, proportional to the likelihood, the methodwill provide direct acces to log-likelihood ratio tests and to likelihood-based confidence intervals.The approach will also be extended to problems in sample identification and DNA barcoding.These new methods will be applied to a case study of divergence among species and subspecies ofChimpanzee. The methods will also be applied to large multi-population multi-locus data sets from humanpopulations.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Rutgers, the State University of New Jersy, New Brunswick New Jersey, USAThe University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.PHS 398 (Rev. 04/06) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Hey, Emanuel B.KEY PERSONNEL.

JimmyAbstract This application proposes to provide integrative training in visual science research at Yale UniversitySchool of Medicine, with a special emphasis on visual neuroscience. The goal of this program is to fosterinterdisciplinary approaches to visual neuroscience that will interface with molecular genetics and clinicalmedicine with respect to development, organization, function and dysfunction of the eye and the central visualsystem. Twelve faculty preceptors from five basic and clinical departments participate in this multidisciplinaryprogram. These faculty members lead vibrant vision research programs in a vision research community atYale that has undergone an exciting phase of revitalization and expansion, and that has attracted anincreasing number of outstanding graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The proposed training programoffers both depth and breadth. The depth derives from its substantive focus on the neurobiology of the eye andthe visual system. The breadth of the program derives from the diversity of approaches, spanning molecular,developmental, systems, cognitive and theoretical neuroscience, as well as from the range of experimentalmodels used in these studies, spanning zebrafish, rodents, and primates. Faculty interests range from retinaldevelopment and degeneration, retinal physiology and circuits to visual cortical function and visual behavior.Methodologies include cloning; cell culture; immunocytochemistry; in situ hybridization; gene transfection andtransgenic technology, electron and two photon microscopy; patch-clamp and multielectrode recording;electroretinograph, calcium and other forms of optical imaging; biochemistry and molecular analyses; psycho-pharmacology; rodent, monkey and human behavior; in vivo extracellular recording in behaving animals; andfMRI and PET imaging in human subjects. Two predoctoral and two postdoctoral positions are requested.

      "Management ofthe Pilot and Feasibility Program The Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research will support Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) studies in type II (bedside to practice and community) translation research. Investigators eligible for P&F studies include: a) new investigators without current or past NIH support as a principal investigator (PI), b) established, funded investigators who have not previously worked in diabetes or diabetes-related areas, and c) established investigators in diabetes or diabetes-related areas with a proposal for testing the feasibility of a new, innovative and/or collaborative idea that is both diabetes-related and represents a clear and distinct departure from his/her ongoing research interest. Applicants for P&F funding must be independent investigators (Instructor level or above at University of Chicago, or community partners with research careers) or be a member of the Center from non-University of Chicago settings, and meet the NIH Eligibility Guidelines for P&F support. Thus, the P&F program supports the development of new investigators into fully independent scientists and senior investigators in other fields to initiate a diabetes-related project, by providing funding to explore novel hypotheses and obtain preliminary data prior to the submission of an application for long-term support to the NIH, American Diabetes Association, or other organization. Information about the current P & F program run by the DRTC is available at (http://drtc.bsd.uchiGago.edu) including instructions for application and list of previously funded applications. In addition to notifying interested investigators via the DRTC website, the Program Director sends an email to all Chicago CDTR members and all academic employees with advanced doctoral degrees in the clinical departments of the University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division. The memorandum is also sent to the Deans of the Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences, and to all Departmental Chairmen. Other approaches are undertaken to ensure that everyone possible knows of this funding opportunity. The Dean is requested to inform the members of the Divisional Executive Committee, consisting of all Departmental and Divisional Committee Chairmen at their monthly meeting. Chairmen are encouraged to discuss the opportunity at departmental meetings and Center participants are encouraged to inform their colleagues ofthe program. To increase the impact of the P&F program and to foster increased inter-institutional research in Chicago, starting in 2005, solicitations for P&F proposals were sent to leading diabetes researchers at Northwestern University, University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University, Rush University, and the Illinois Institute of Technology. Research conducted solely at these institutions could be supported by this funding mechanism, although collaborative projects across institutions were strongly encouraged. The Chicago CDTR has steadily increased the number of investigators at institutions other than the University of Chicago. Some faculty are uncertain as to whether they should apply for these grants. They are directed to the P & F Director or one of the Executive Committee, to clarify the issues e.g. eligibility, subject matter, budget allocation, etc. This interactive process has proven to be most advantageous in terms of the Center's reputation and in ensuring that the greatest number of faculty are encouraged to apply. Much information about the Center is imparted to the University community. One of Dr. Peek's roles will be to represent the importance of translational research in improving the care, outcomes, and prevention of diabetes.\n",

Describeconcisely the research design and methods for achieving these goals. Avoid summaries of past accomplishments and the use of the first person. This abstractis meant to serve as a succinct and accurate description of the proposed work when separated from the application. If the application is funded, thisdescription, as is, will become public information. Therefore, do not include proprietary/confidential information. DO NOT EXCEED THE SPACEPROVIDED.Pediatric cataracts are observed in 1-15 per 10,000 births. Congenital cataract represents the most severeend of the spectrum due to interference with normal visual development and the possibility of permanentblindness. Genetic studies have identified mutations in numerous genes associated with various forms ofcataracts. The exact frequencies of mutations in these known genes in patients with congenital/juvenilecataract are not known and many cases are still awaiting molecular diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing(WES) is a novel technology that can be utilized for identification of causative mutations in both known andnovel genes and thus could significantly facilitate characterization/classification of pediatric cataracts at amolecular level. In preliminary experiments, WES was used to screen probands from 22 pedigrees affectedwith familial dominant congenital/juvenile cataract and identified causative mutations in known cataractgenes and one novel crystallin gene in 45% (10/22) of families. In this proposal, we focus on theidentification of novel genetic factors involved in human congenital/juvenile cataract through analysis offamilial cases. The first aim is to identify genetic mutations associated with cataract in the twelve previouslyidentified families without mutations in known cataract genes and twelve additional affected pedigrees. Thefirst step will be whole exome sequencing/known cataract gene analysis of the additional probands, which islikely to identify causative mutations in 40-50% of the families. Discovery of novel genetic factors in familieswithout mutations will initially be approached by evaluation of genes which have a known role in vertebratelens development/function or are located within a previously reported cataract loci. Next, WES of additionalfamily members in mutation-negative pedigrees and combined analysis of their exome variation will beundertaken to identify deleterious variants in novel factors. The second aim is to verify the involvement ofnovel factors in congenital/juvenile cataract by functional analysis of the new candidate cataract factors inzebrafish and examination of a larger group of human patients affected with cataract and related ocularconditions for mutations in these genes. Identification of the genes/mutant alleles associated with pediatriccataract and determination of their specific contributions to disease will guide development and utilization ofgenetic tests for accurate diagnosis and predictions of phenotypic severity and recurrence risks, thus offeringsuperior counseling to affected families. In addition to this, understanding of the genetic mechanisms ofcataracts will improve our knowledge about lens biology and lead to better treatment and management oflens opacities at all ages.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Department of PediatricsChildren's Research InstituteMedical College of Wisconsin8701 Watertown Plank RoadMilwaukee, WI 53226KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Otitis media (OM) is the most common reason that an ill child visits a health care provider or undergoes ageneral anesthetic. OM is also the most common reason that a child receives an oral antibiotic and theover-treatment of patients with OM has been suspected of contributing to the development of antimicrobial-resistant organisms. OM disproportionately affects socio-economically disadvantaged children, NativeAmerican children and is a factor that inhibits women from full participation in the workforce.The major focus of our laboratory for the past decade has been elucidating the pathophysiology of chronicOM with the ultimate goal of developing more effective treatments. During this time, we have shown thatchronic OM is not a purely inflammatory process, but rather is a bacterial biofilm illness. The recognition thatOM is a biofilm disease then led to a novel hypothesis: The Distributed Genome Hypothesis. Thishypothesis states that there is a supra-genome for pathogenic bacteria and that each individual bacteriumpossesses only a subset of genes from the supra-genome. The supra-genome is a reservoir for a panoplyof contingency genes that collectively provides a significant survival benefit for the population-at-large. Inthis continuing application we specifically test the Distributed Genome Hypothesis in Haemophilusinvluenzae (HI) with four Specific Aims: 1) Perform comparative genomic studies among clinical isolates ofH! to characterize the extent of genomic plasticity; 2) Determine the extent of HI inter-isolate recombinationduring the infectious process; 3) Prepare transformation knockouts of HI and compare their survival time invivo with wild-type congenic strains; 4) Phenotypic characterization of HI biofilms. These Specific Aims willbe accomplished by experiments using state-of-the-art high throughput genomics, molecular biology,imaging and modeling techniques, as well as investigations in children. Preliminary data generated from amicroarray library composed of 10 clinical isolates of H. influenzae demonstrated that H. influenzae doesindeed have a supra-genome that is twice the Size of a single bacterium. These findings shed light on manyaspects of OM, including disease persistence in the fact of antibiotic treatment, and provide an explanationfor the success of adenoidectomy in the management of OM.PERFORMANCE SiTE(S) (organization, city, state)Center for Genomic Sciences, Allegheny-Singer Research Institute (ASRI), Pittsburgh, PACenter for Biofilm Engineering, Montana State University (MSU), Bozeman, MTKEY PERSONNEL.

      "The current proposal focuses on the concept that thyroid hormone activation (T4 to T3 conversion) via thetype 2 deiodinase (D2)plays a critical role in fuel homeostasis and energy expenditure. This conceptoriginated from studies in brown adipose tissue (BAT), the main thermogenic tissue in human newborns andother small mammals. Recently, the discovery of D2 activity in human skeletal muscle has generatedconsiderable excitement as it has become clear that deiodination is a common mechanism for metaboliccontrol (1). Given this background, we were immediately intrigued by fact that BAT D2 is up-regulated in amouse model of resistance to diet-induced obesity. In this model, supplementation with 0.5% bile acidsprevents animals from becoming overweight or insulin-resistant when placed on a high fat diet. Intensecollaborative investigation resulted in the first recognition of an FXR-independent metabolic pathway throughwhich bile acids interact with the G-protein coupled receptor TGR5 and thus stimulate D2 in metabolicallyrelevant tissues including BAT and human skeletal myocytes. Our preliminary studies indicate that other ;GPCRs also stimulate D2. These striking data suggest that the spectrum of metabolites controlling D2, andthe range of target tissues in which this mechanism is operant may be even more extensive than previouslythought. With this in mind, we have begun to search for novel D2-regulating substances, and havepreliminary evidence supporting significant regulatory effects for xenobiotic compounds. Understanding howmetabolic signals from rapidly fluctuating endogenous molecules and xenobiotic factors are integrated viathe D2 pathway is the major goal of these studies. Ultimately, by understanding these novel mechanisms forthyroid-hormone dependent metabolic control, we hope to identify new targets and approaches fortherapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders including type II diabetes, obesity, and the metabolicsyndrome.PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (organization, city, state)Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston MAPHS 398 (Rev. 09/04) Page 2 Form Page 2Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): BIANCO, ANTONIO C.KEY PERSONNEL.

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Vyavahare Narendra R. Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a complex physiological response involving both progressive tissue damage and activation of reparative processes including neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and plasticity through axonal sprouting and synaptic reorganization. The limited capacity for remodeling in the adult brain is attributable to age-related changes in the extrinsic neuronal microenvironment such as accumulation of myelin- associated inhibitors (MAIs), and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), as well as intrinsic changes in neuronal biochemistry such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Several groups have begun to investigate therapeutic strategies to overcome these barriers using monoclonal antibodies against MAIs, CSPG- degradative enzymes, and drugs that modulate cAMP levels. Despite encouraging results, the clinical translation of these approaches is limited by the need for invasive delivery methods, transplantation of xenogenic cells, and use of bacterially-derived enzymes. The objective of this project is to develop novel neuron-specific nanotherapeutics for combinatorial delivery of drug and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting both extrinsic and intrinsic barriers to neuroplasticity. These nanotherapeutics will consist of poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-graft-polyethyleneimine (PgP) copolymer micelles loaded with 1) rolipram, phosphodiesterase inhibitor in the hydrophobic core to stabilize neuronal cAMP levels, 2) siRNA bound to the cationic shell targeting RhoA, an intracellular signaling molecule activated by multiple neuronal growth inhibitors, and 3) a monoclonal antibody against the Nogo receptor (mNgR1) that binds MAIs for neuronal targeting and inhibition of MAI/receptor binding. The Specific Aims are: 1. to synthesize and evaluate PgP- mNgR1 nanoparticles as a drug and siRNA carrier, 2. to evaluate the ability of PgP-mNgR1 nanotherapeutics loaded with rolipram and RhoA siRNA to inhibit RhoA expression, elevate cAMP, and stimulate neurite outgrowth on inhibitory substrates, and 3. to evaluate neuroplasticity and functional recovery in response to delivery of nanotherapeutics in a rat direct cortical impact model of TBI. These studies will rely upon close collaboration with the Cell, Tissue, and Molecular Analysis Core and Bioengineering and Bioimaging Core for material characterization, analysis of cell response, and animal imaging and on the expertise of the PI's mentors Drs. Mark Kindy and Michael Lynn in basic and clinical neuroscience. Through these studies, we will develop PgP as a targeted, combinatorial drug-delivery system capable of addressing the complex pathology of TBI. Due to their modular design, these NPs can be modified for use with various drugs/siRNA and targeting ligands, providing broad applicability to a diverse range of pathologies.

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hargreaves, Ken M.PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):Numerous studies indicate that women and men differ in prevalence of pain disorders or pain intensity,possibly due to sexually dimorphic differences in detection, processing or responses to noxious stimuli. Here,we propose to study a peripheral sexually dimorphic pain mechanism that occurs in humans. The importanceof this complex problem has been emphasized by recent NIH policies (NOT OD 15-102). The objective hereis to determine the effects of serotonin (5HT), applied to dental pulp biopsies from women versus men, onactivation of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors, and the mechanisms mediating this response.Our central hypothesis is that 5-HT preferentially releases complement peptides C3a or C5a from peripheraltissues of women compared to men, leading to a sexually dimorphic increase in TRPV1 activities intrigeminal (TG) sensory neurons. This central hypothesis is based on substantial novel preliminary datademonstrating that 5HT produces a sexually dimorphic difference in capsaicin activation of humanpeptidergic fibers via release of complement peptides. The Aims will:Specific Aim #1: Determine the cell type expressing C3a, C5a, C3aR, & C5aR in female versus male humandental pulp. Additional studies will determine the effects of inflammation (irreversible pulpitis) on expressionand release of C3a and C5a from female and male human tissues.Specific Aim #2: Determine the 5-HT receptor subtype(s) and G-protein and effector signaling pathwaysmediating 5-HT-evoked release of C3a and C5a from female and male human tissues.Specific Aim #3: Determine the receptors, G-protein and effector signaling pathways mediating C3a-andC5a-evoked increase in activities of capsaicin-sensitive neurons. The central hypothesis is highly innovative and, if supported, would have an important positive impact on thefield since it supports a new model for sexually dimorphic pain mechanisms with therapeutic implications.Moreover, the use of isolated human tissue biopsies and primary neuronal cultures fosters studies on thecellular mechanisms mediating this sexually dimorphic effect and increases translational significance.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Women often experince greater intensity or frequency of pain disorders. While there are likely manymechanisms mediating this effect, comparatively little research has focused on peripheal mechanisms. Inthis application, we seek to study a novel pain mechanism in isolated human tissues. If positive results areobtained, we may have discovered a novel target to develop new anlagesics for treating women in pain.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) OMB No. 0925-0001 Page 2 Form Page 2\n",

      "NINDS Biotechnology Products and BiologicsRegulatory Affairs Consulting ServicesSTATEMENT OF WORKFINAL REVISED DOCUMENT04/11/2016BACKGROUNDThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  NINDS intramural labs are headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, primarily located in Bethesda, MD. For more information on the NINDS Intramural program visit the website http://dir1.ninds.nih.gov/ninds/Home.aspxFor extramural research, NINDS awards grants and cooperative agreements to outside academic institutions, small business concerns and other organizations all over the U.S. and world to fund promising basic, translational, and clinical research projects. Specifically, the NINDS Office of Translational Research (OTR) is committed to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into the development of new therapeutic interventions through early nonclinical development and early clinical investigation. For more information about the Office of Translational Research visit the website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/translational_research/index.htmProjects that are funded through a cooperative agreement award mechanism are led by the principal investigators (PI) team with NINDS program staff participation in guiding the project plan. The PI’s team performs all of the experiments while NINDS role is to establish performance milestones for each project to facilitate go/no-go decision making and then monitor research progress and achievement of project milestones. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE \tThe NINDS is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced discovery and development Biologics Regulatory Affairs consultants with expertise in biotechnology products and biologics to assist NINDS program staff to vet and advance only the most promising therapeutic biologics through the discovery and development pipeline. Both individual subject matter experts and multidisciplinary teams from consulting firms are encouraged to apply. The NIH anticipates awarding multiple consulting awards in reference to this requirement. Approximately two, and a maximum of three, awards are anticipated.A.\tSCOPE OF WORKGeneral RequirementsEach consultant is expected to provide technical guidance and advice on advancing discovery and development projects through early nonclinical development and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) package, and in some cases, design of early clinical protocol and launch of a first in human clinical trial. Consulting services will be for NINDS biologics-focused projects or any other NIH program with similar needs as outlined in the scope of this statement of work.Consulting advice and guidance shall be required to supplement NINDS program experience from the pre-application stage and then throughout the life of each project to review and monitor progress.  Consultants will serve as a resource to NINDS staff from the start of early discovery stage projects to structurally modify and optimize design characteristics of leads through IND-enabling activities necessary to advance potential development candidates through scale up, and early phase clinical trials.Consultants will be expected to provide feedback and guidance on projects to NINDS staff through written documents, conference calls, and by email. The consultants’ major responsibility will be in offering review, guidance and advice on projects. They will be expected to offer technical review and feedback on project milestones, progress reports, or development plans, study design, and data interpretation. Specific consulting responsibilities will depend on the expertise of the individual consultant and the needs of individual projects.  On rare occasion, consultants may be asked to give oral presentations to NINDS staff or at an NINDS sponsored webinar, workshop or conference to provide training to investigators in their area of expertise.Consultants may be involved in multiple projects.   Each project team is led by a PI and supported by NINDS staff with disease and therapy development expertise. The joint team establishes project milestones and monitors progress at least annually. The PIs conduct all of the research activities and report progress to NINDS. NINDS staff will interact directly with the PI and request assistance from consultants to review and provide expert advice on specific topics.  Consultants shall directly advise NINDS staff, and in some cases communicate directly with the PI on team calls.Specific Requirements for Biologics Regulatory Affairs ConsultantsBiologics regulatory affairs consultant shall provide the following services:•\tAdvise NINDS staff on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulatory guidelines, regulations, and requirements pertaining to the early nonclinical and early clinical development of biologics•\tReview and assess data and project related proposals, and advise on study requirements to file an IND package for a range of potential biologics therapeutic modalities in nonclinical IND-enabling development – such as peptides, antibodies, recombinant proteins, oligonucleotides, cell and gene therapies -  based on regulatory precedence and compliance to Common Technical Document (CTD) format requirements, including:   o\tReview of administrative information (e.g. target product profiles, clinical protocols, and investigator information)o\tReview of animal pharmacology and toxicology study results to assess whether the product is expected to be reasonably safe for initial testing in humanso\tDetermine if previous relevant human experience is available for similar biologics or research and report results from relevant clinical trials conducted both inside and outside of the US.o\tReview chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) nonclinical study plans and results pertaining to the composition, manufacturing, testing, stability and controls for a range of biologics to assess compliance to regulatory guidance. o\tReview clinical protocols and investigator information to assess adherence to investigational regulations and study protocols as it pertains to a biologic modality in each case.  o\tIntegrate regulatory guidance with research plans to advance translational research objectives.•\tProvide guidance to the preparation of pre-IND and IND Meetings or review FDA responses to recommend new course of action. •\tReview, identify and assess regulatory risks and gaps to IND-enabling research study plans and recommend solutions •\tProvide oral presentations in area of expertise as requested•\tCommunicate effectively both orally and in writing B.\tKEY PERSONNELThe consultants working under this award shall be considered key personnel.

      "NINDS Biotechnology Products and Biologics CMC Development Consulting ServicesSTATEMENT OF WORKFINAL REVISED DOCUMENT04/11/2016\t\t\t\tA.\tBACKGROUNDThe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  NINDS intramural labs are headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, primarily located in Bethesda, MD. For more information on the NINDS Intramural program visit the website http://dir1.ninds.nih.gov/ninds/Home.aspxFor extramural research, NINDS awards grants and cooperative agreements to outside academic institutions, small business concerns and other organizations all over the U.S. and world to fund promising basic, translational, and clinical research projects. Specifically, the NINDS Office of Translational Research (OTR) is committed to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into the development of new therapeutic interventions through early nonclinical development and early clinical investigation. For more information about the Office of Translational Research visit the website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/translational_research/index.htmProjects that are funded through a cooperative agreement award mechanism are led by the principal investigators (PI) team with NINDS program staff participation in guiding the project plan. The PI’s team performs all of the experiments while NINDS role is to establish performance milestones for each project to facilitate go/no-go decision making and then monitor research progress and achievement of project milestones. B.\tSTATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE \tThe NINDS is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced Biologics Chemical Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Development Consultants with expertise in biotechnology products and biologics to assist NINDS program staff to vet and advance only the most promising therapeutic biologics through the discovery and development pipeline.

The NIH anticipates awarding multiple consulting awards in reference to this requirement. Approximately two, and a maximum of three, awards are anticipated.C.\tSCOPE OF WORKGeneral RequirementsEach consultant is expected to provide technical guidance and advice on advancing early discovery and development projects through early nonclinical development and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) package, and in some cases, design of early clinical protocol and launch of a first in human clinical trial. Consulting services will be for NINDS biologics-focused projects or any other NIH program with similar needs as outlined in the scope of this statement of work.Consulting advice and guidance shall be required to supplement NINDS program experience from the pre-application stage and then throughout the life of each project to review and monitor progress.  Consultants will serve as a resource to NINDS staff from the start of early discovery stage projects to structurally modify and optimize design characteristics of leads through IND-enabling activities necessary to advance potential development candidates through scale up, and early phase clinical trials.Consultants will be expected to provide feedback and guidance on projects to NINDS staff through written documents, conference calls, and by email. The consultants’ major responsibility will be in offering review, guidance and advice on projects. They will be expected to offer technical review and feedback on project milestones, progress reports, or development plans, study design, and data interpretation. Specific consulting responsibilities will depend on the expertise of the individual consultant and the needs of individual projects.  On rare occasion, consultants may be asked to give oral presentations to NINDS staff or at an NINDS sponsored webinar, workshop or conference to provide training to investigators in their area of expertise.Consultants may be involved in multiple projects.   Each project team is led by a PI and supported by NINDS staff with disease and therapy development expertise. The joint team establishes project milestones and monitors progress at least annually. The PIs conduct all of the research activities and report progress to NINDS. NINDS staff will interact directly with the PI and request assistance from consultants to review and provide expert advice on specific topics.  Consultants shall directly advise NINDS staff, and in some cases communicate directly with the PI on team calls.Specific Requirements for Biologics Chemical Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Development ConsultantsBiologics CMC development consultants shall provide the following services:•\tProvide guidance to NINDS staff on all CMC related requirements of early non clinical and early clinical development of biologics (such as peptides, antibodies, recombinant proteins, oligonucleotides, and cell and gene therapies) in accordance with the US regulatory and the ICH guidelines.•\tReview and comment on the adequacy of biologic manufacturing including scale-up, analytical method development, and process development (upstream and downstream processing) approaches proposed by investigators •\tProvide expert advice, risk and gap analysis to NINDS staff  related to all CMC aspects such as proposed analytical strategy, QC release methods requirements, formulation development, stability testing, stage appropriate assay requirements such as potency and viral clearance•\tProvide guidance on delivery methods which may include complex formulations such as polymer, liposomes, and nanoparticles•\tProvide expert advice on master and working cell and viral bank development and testing•\tProvide oral presentations in area of expertise as required.•\tCommunicate effectively both orally and in writing •\tProvide recommendations regarding global regulatory regulations and guidelines pertaining to the nonclinical and early clinical development of biologics.

Purpose of Contract:\t\t\tThe purpose of this contract is to provide logistical and administrative support for activities associated with convening 18th Annual Udall Centers Meeting on November 3-4, 2016 from 8:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. The meeting will be held at The Bethesda North Marriott Hotel, 5701 Marinelli Road, North Bethesda, MD 20852.Contractors shall submit offers on a Firm Fixed Price Basis, except for costs associated with sponsored participant’s travel, lodging, M&IE, ground transportation, meeting materials, name badges and table tents which shall be submitted on a Time and Materials Basis.7.  Background:The NINDS Udall Centers program is a Congressionally authorized effort established in 1997 immediately following the passage of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson’s Disease Research Act (P.L. 105-78) into law. The NINDS currently funds 9 Udall Centers across the country, a central component of the NINDS portfolio in Parkinson’s disease research. The goal of this program is to fund multidisciplinary Centers of Excellence that can rapidly advance innovative research to improve understanding and treatment of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and related disorders. Udall Centers perform state-of-the art basic, translational, and clinical research on PD. This includes the examination of underlying neurobiological and neuropathological mechanisms, identification and characterization of candidate and disease-associated genes, establishment of improved PD models, target identification and early testing of potential therapeutic strategies, and the exploration of novel avenues of clinical research.  Since the initiation of this program, the NINDS has convened annual meetings of the currently supported Udall Centers.  Meetings are planned by the Udall Center Coordinating Committee (UC3), consisting of the Udall Center Directors, NINDS leadership and staff, and two outside members from patient advocacy groups.  Recent meetings have emphasized collaborative planning based on emergent areas in the PD field (translational research, 2011) as well as on common areas of interest across the Centers (e.g. coordination of clinical cores, 2012; priorities for Parkinson’s disease research, 2013;  big data resources/data sharing, 2014 and collaborative approaches to emergent issues in Parkinson’s disease, 2015).   8.  Section 508 Requirements The Contractor shall ensure Section 508 Compliance. This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board’s Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board’s standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov.

      "Contact PD/PI: Buchanan, Thomas A Inst-Career-Dev-001 (047)MCD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTWe propose a two-year Mentored Career Development (MCD) Program for clinician scholars that will lead togeneral competency in clinical and translational research and establish a lifelong methodological foundationoverlaid with the additional competencies in communications, grant-writing, leadership and team science thatare requisite for success as an independent career investigator. Consistent with the theme of the SouthernCalifornia Clinical and Translational Science Institute (SC CTSI), the MCD Scholars will also develop thespecific competencies and insights needed to carry out research in and translate findings to diversepopulations. The MCD Program builds on a formal methodological core and complementary careerdevelopment activities that have been established during the first four years of funding. We plan every-other-year cohorts of seven trainees, three supported by this award and four with institutional support. Trainees willenroll either in the existing Master of Science or Certificate in Clinical, Translational and BiomedicalInvestigations, completing a three-course methodological core, courses in biostatistics, and new courses onresearch in diverse populations and informatics. A major outcome for the core courses is completion of a K orR type proposal. The program for each MCD Scholar is tailored around the Individual Development Plan (IDP)and discussion with the mentoring team. Complementary activities include a career development seminarseries, NIH-style mock review of planned applications, and mentor training. Scholars will have community-based experiences related to clinical and translational research and work with mentors from a communitysetting. They will have an array of internal and external opportunities to gain experience in regulatory science,in innovation and technology transfer, in health services and health outcomes, and in industry settings. Arobust distance education platform is in place, which will be used for flexibility, archiving, and dissemination ofmaterials, and training is offered in “digital scholarship.” We intend to collaborate with the other California hubsto develop and disseminate a model curriculum in research on diverse populations, along with other products.Evaluation covers short-, intermediate- and long-term metrics, and the resulting data are used for continuingrefinement of our program. The Multiple Principal Investigators, Drs. Samet and Patino-Sutton, havecollaborated in developing the program over the first funding cycle; they are joined by faculty and mentors whobring expertise and experience with all phases of clinical and translational research and have rich records ofresearch in diverse populations. Looking back over accomplishments since the SC CTSI was funded by theNational Institutes of Health, we can identify transformative and widespread institutional change consequent tothe current KL2 and TL1 programs. We have established a novel model for training at an institution that hadonly begun to formalize training in clinical and translational research before the SC CTSI programs wereinitiated. In this next phase, we will refine our training approach and aim to train researchers who carry outmeaningful research to improve the health of diverse populations.Project Summary/Abstract Page 676Contact PD/PI: Buchanan, Thomas A Inst-Career-Dev-001 (047)BLANK DOCUMENTPer the RFA-TR-14-009 instructions, Bibliography & References Cited is required for the Overall component,and not required for Administrative Core, Translational Science Base, Research Expertise and Methods,Research Implementation and Participation, Network Resources and Optional Modules, and Mentored CareerDevelopment components.References Cited Page 677Contact PD/PI: Buchanan, Thomas A Inst-Career-Dev-001 (047) OMB Number: 4040-0001Expiration Date: 06/30/2016RESEARCH & RELATED Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded)PROFILE - Project Director/Principal InvestigatorPrefix: First Name*: Jonathan Middle Name M.

The primary objective ofthe KL2 program is to recruit, train and nurture a new cadre of professionals with defined knowledge andexpertise in CTS. An additional objective, via the ITMAT, is to attain centralized organization and supervision ofall clinical and translational training programs at Penn and its partner institutions under a single leadershipstructure. We will work to achieve this objective across the spectrum of potential and existing postdoctoraltrainees transitioning to junior faculty in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Engineering andVeterinary Medicine. Our approach to achieve this objective is through the provision of a structuredcombination of course work, a mentored research project, a professional development core, short termexternships, and a resource core that provides efficiency and an enabling environment. Nine scholars will beappointed, each for a minimum of two years. Upon completion of the KL2 program, scholars are expected tohave mastered the required core competencies for clinical and translational scientists and to have achievedobjective measures of success – published in the peer reviewed literature, obtained an individual mentoredcareer development award or independent grant funding and secured an academic or industry appointmentwith continued substantial engagement in CTS.Project Summary/Abstract Page 578Contact PD/PI: FITZGERALD, GARRET A Inst-Career-Dev-001 (526) OMB Number: 4040-0001Expiration Date: 06/30/2016RESEARCH & RELATED Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded) PROFILE - Project Director/Principal InvestigatorPrefix:  First Name*: Emma Middle Name Anne Last Name*: Meagher Suffix: Position/Title*: Senior Associate Dean for Clinical ResOrganization Name*: University of PennsylvaniaDepartment:Division:Street1*: ITMAT - Perelman School of MedicineStreet2: 3400 Spruce StreetCity*: PHILADELPHIACounty:State*: PA: PennsylvaniaProvince:Country*: USA: UNITED STATESZip / Postal Code*: 191045158Phone Fax Number:  E-Mail*: emma@upenn.eduNumber*: 215-662-2174Credential, e.g., agency login: EMEAGHERProject Role*:  Other (Specify) Other Project Role Category: Core LeadDegree Type:  MD Degree Year:   File Name Mime TypeAttach Biographical Sketch*: MeagherE_Biosketch_CTSA_2015.pdfapplication/pdfAttach Current & Pending Support: Page 579Tracking Number: GRANT11998683 Funding Opportunity Number: PAR-15-304 .

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Nestler, Eric, J.Project SummaryThis R01 grant is aimed at better understanding the molecular mechanisms by which chronic exposure todrugs of abuse induces long-lasting changes in the brain's reward circuits that contribute to the complexbehavioral abnormalities that define an addicted state. Our work focuses on the transcription factor, AFosB,which is induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other key brain reward regions in response to chronicadministration of virtually all drugs of abuse. AFosB is unique in that it accumulates to appreciable levels onlyafter chronic drug exposure and, because of its unusual stability, persists for weeks-months of withdrawal.AFosB is thus one mechanism by which chronic drug exposure can drive long-lasting changes in geneexpression that contribute to addiction. Indeed, considerable evidence supports the view that induction ofAFosB in NAc mediates a state of heightened reward and motivation that could contribute to aspects of theaddiction process. In this requested R37 renewal, we will characterize the precise mechanisms through whichAFosB exerts these actions. Using state-of-the-art genome-wide chromatin assays, we will identify the genes inthe NAc that are direct targets for AFosB in the context of cocaine and opiate self-administration. Such genes,in turn, provide novel insight into the molecular and cellular basis of drug-induced neural and behavioralplasticity. Interestingly, when AFosB binds to its target genes, it can either activate or repress them. Ourhypothesis is that such activation vs. repressive actions are determined by the chromatin milieu of the affectedgene. As well, partially non-overlapping genes are regulated by AFosB in NAc in response to the two drugs.Although this is likely mediated in part by the partly distinct subsets of neurons in which the drugs induceAFosB, we once again hypothesize that this specificity is also mediated partly by differences in other chromatinchanges that cocaine and opiates induce at specific genes. In addition to exploring AFosB's regulation of targetgenes, we will also characterize several mechanisms that are crucial in determining the amount and activity ofAFosB induced in the NAc. Together, these studies will identify many novel actions of drugs of abuse whichcan be exploited for the development of improved diagnostic tests and treatments for addiction.PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page 2 Continuation Format PageProgramDirector/PrincipalInvestigator(Last,First,Middle): Nestler,EriC,J.

      "Contact PD/PI: FITZGERALD, GARRET A NRSA-Training-001 (234)Core J: Institutional Training CorePROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe goal and significance of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) TL1 proposal is matched to both a nationaland societal need to dramatically enhance clinical and translational science (CTS). A key component of thisgoal is to train the next generation of research leaders of this domain. As expressed throughout our CTSAproposal, Penn is committed “all-in” to the advancement of translational science, led by the Institute forTranslation Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT), and within this to achieve the overarching TL1 goal of armingour trainees with the awareness, skills and resources that will position them to excel in the conduct of CTS.Ten pre-doctoral and ten post-doctoral slots are requested to support TL1 Scholars who will enroll in eitherCertificate (1year) or Master degree (2-3year) programs developed specifically for CTS. The structure ofPenn's TL1 builds synergistically upon and integrates seamlessly with Penn's outstanding graduate and post-graduate programs, but recognizes that translational science requires a distinctive, additional knowledge andskill set. Pre-doctoral Scholars will be selected from Penn's PhD, MD/PhD and VMD/PhD research programsand MD, VMD, DMD and MNS clinical training programs. Similarly, post-doctoral Scholars will be selectedfrom Penn's outstanding clinical (MD, VMD, DMD) residents and fellows, and research (PhD) fellows.The primary objectives of the TL1 program are:• Recruit talented and committed trainees by promoting awareness and individual assessment;• Develop mentored personalized trainee educational plans targeted both to discipline specific skills and professional competencies;• Develop fundamental scientific skills and conduct mentored research in clinical and translationalscience;• Advance training programs in emerging areas of translational science;• Augment aligned professional skill sets of trainees to bolster career progressionScholars are supported by innovative cross-discipline bridges, by creating new knowledge paradigms fortranslation, by providing outstanding translational research facilities and cores, and through active advising andmentorship – always with an eye toward the highest ethical standards, the essential tenants of translation,what unites our trainees as colleagues, and what distinguishes our training program and the TL1 award as asingular entity, rather than a mere collection of elements. The TL1 minimizes time-to-degree by effective useof elective units and off-hours online instruction. The TL1 emphasizes the development of individualprofessional development plans to support diverse career preferences. Importantly, the program is alsocoupled to a robust diversity and inclusion effort, and a dedicated mentoring program.In summary, Penn's TL1/CTSA approach speaks directly to each of the five key CTSA goals and builds uponexisting excellence with rigor, breadth, flexibility and individuality. The educational program is led by talentedand experienced Co-Program Directors and the TL1 award is seamlessly integrated with the CTSA-U and KL2award components. Importantly, the TL1 award is the only dedicated mechanism at Penn to support pre andpost-doctoral scholars in CTS.Project Summary/Abstract Page 1102Contact PD/PI: FITZGERALD, GARRET A NRSA-Training-001 (234) OMB Number: 4040-0001Expiration Date: 06/30/2016RESEARCH & RELATED Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded) PROFILE - Project Director/Principal InvestigatorPrefix:  First Name*: Glen Middle Name N.

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Overall ICRC Summary and Personnel)PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):The mission of the Center for Injury Research and Policy (CIRP) is the prevention and control of fatal andnonfatal injury (unintentional and intentional) and related disability among children and adolescents. Withinnovative research as its core, CIRP works to continually improve the scientific understanding of theepidemiology, biomechanics, prevention, acute treatment and rehabilitation of injuries. CIRP serves as apioneer by translating cutting edge injury research into education, policy, programs, and advances in clinicalcare. CIRP's structure and culture foster integrated interdisciplinary collaboration among its world-class teamof research scientists, staff, and partners, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations,public and private sector entities, community groups, professionals, parents, and other stakeholders. CIRP iswidely recognized as an effective voice and change agent for pediatric injury prevention and control, andplays a critical role as a resource at local to global levels for translation of injury research into practice.CIRP's administrative core provides leadership, oversight and support through effective communication,fostering a positive culture of collaborative productivity, professional development of faculty and staff, andeffective monitoring, evaluation and quality improvement feedback for center actvities. CIRP's outreach corefacilitates translation of research into practice through collaborative partnerships; leadership in advocacy,consultation, and technical assistance; and development, dissemination, and promotion of use of highquality, evidenced-based, pediatric injury prevention information and resources. CIRP's training andeducation core provides training and education opportunities to students at undergraduate, graduate andpost-graduate levels to prepare the next generation of injury prevention professionals, and to public healthand other professionals to promote an interdisciplinary approach to this public health problem at local toglobal levels. CIRP's research core facilitates high-quality research, which will fill important gaps in ourknowledge and lead to the prevention and control of pediatric injuries through translation into effectiveeducation, policies, programs, and other interventions.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Prevention of injuries among children and adolescents deserves special focus and attention, becauseinjuries are the leading cause of death and acquired disability among our nation's youth, and becausechildren have unique anatomic, physiologic, psychological, and other developmental characteristics andneeds that require different strategies and interventions for effective injury prevention and control, whencompared with adults.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name: Center for Injury Research and Policy, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's HospDUNS:Street 1: 700 Children's Drive Street 2:City: Columbus County: Franklin State: OhioProvince: Country: USA Zip/Postal Code: 43205Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 6/09) Page 2 Form Page 2Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Overall ICRC Summary and Personnel)SENIOR/KEY PERSONNEL.

The content of thesepolicies vary dramatically, the policies vary in the age of young athletes covered by the legislation, and varyin the level of sport covered by the legislation. Although all state level concussion policies have the samegoal – to make sports safer for young athletes by reducing morbidity/mortality associated with concussion –these differences in policies are very likely to influence their effectiveness. No evaluation of these state levelconcussion policies has occurred to date. The objective of this research project is to evaluate stateconcussion policies' effectiveness/outcomes, both those that have already been passed and those that willbe passed over the next 5 years, using data from The National High School Sports-Related InjurySurveillance Study (High School RIOTM), currently the only sports-related injury surveillance systemcapturing concussions in a large national sample of high school athletes. Specific aims are to 1) identify andinvestigate components of state concussion policy development/passage that may act as effect modifierswhich influence their effectiveness (e.g. involvement of community stakeholders, use of data to drivediscussions, etc), 2) evaluate the effectiveness of current state concussion policies by comparing pre andpost policy passage concussion data and comparing states with and without concussion policies, 3)prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of state level concussion policies passed over the next 5 years, and4) determine how specific components of state concussion policies (e.g. who is authorized to clear an injuredathlete to return to play, are coaches required to take a concussion education course, etc) impact theireffectiveness. The practical long term goal of this effort is to reduce the morbidity/mortality associated withconcussion among young athletes by identifying the components of the most effective state level concussionpolicies. An additional long term goal is to identify factors associated with development/passage of statelevel concussion legislation and effective components of state level concussion legislation that may provideguidance for state level legislative efforts in other injury prevention arenas.RELEVANCE (See instructions):This project is relevant to public heatlh because understanding what compentents of legislative injuryprevention policies are most effective will lead to improved effectiveness of future legislative efforts.The project will impact public health by both retrospectively evaluating preveiously passed state levelconcussion policies and prospectively evaluating policies wich will be pased during the next 5 years.This project is releveant to the CDC NCIPC's mission to reduce morbidity/mortality associated with TBI.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 6/09) Page 2 Form Page 2Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Comstock Small Research Project)SENIOR/KEY PERSONNEL.

Because of this, injury researchers areincreasingly active at disseminating and translating research findings through local and national media.While news coverage of pediatric injury studies appears to be a useful way to disseminate information little isknown about where parents typically access such information, whether parents understand messages aboutinjury-related studies, whether they further disseminate this information and how they make decisions basedon information provided by media sources. There exists, therefore, a critical need to understand how parentsaccess, understand and use pediatric injury news. Our objective in this application is to assess how parentsaccess, understand, react to and further disseminate information from media sources reporting on pediatricinjury studies that focus on motor vehicle crashes and use of child safety seats and poisoning prevention andthe safe storage of poisons and household cleaners. Upon successful completion of this project it is ourexpectation that we will have a better understanding of the types of media that parents access, as well ashow they understand and use information conveyed in such media to prevent injuries. Aim #1: Determineparents' media access and use patterns to enhance dissemination of pediatric injury research findings; andAim #2: Evaluate parental understanding of news messages about pediatric injury research findings. Amixed-method approach will be used. We will conduct a nationally representative online survey with 1000parents of children 0-6 years about media access and use patterns and we will conduct focus groups with 65parents, in which actual news segments will be used as stimulus material, to evaluate parentalunderstanding of messages and how this varies by health literacy skills. This contribution will be significantbecause we expect the research will generate valuable information for injury researchers, communicationspecialists and others who disseminate pediatric injury research findings. The proposed research isinnovative because we will make use of actual news segments on pediatric injury research findings.RELEVANCE (See instructions):This research is relevant to public health because the dissemination of injury prevention information is crucialfor ensuring that a key audience is informed about safe practices. This will impact public health by ensuringthat parents have access to and understand messages provided. Thus, the proposed research is relevant tothe CDC's mission that pertains to preventing pediatric injuries and reducing their consequences.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 6/09) Page 2 Form Page 2Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (McKenzie Small Research Project)SENIOR/KEY PERSONNEL.

Death certificate data and hospital discharge data have been used to describe the burden of drugpoisonings in Ohio. However, drug poisoning surveillance based on death records and inpatient hospitaldischarge data are limited by the timeliness of their data collection and the capability of their ICD-9-basedcoding system in identifying important prescription drugs. Furthermore, data are lacking about drugpoisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio. In collaboration with the Ohio's poison controlcenters and the Ohio Department of Health, we propose to use the national and Ohio poison control centers'data to study drug poisonings among adolescents and young adults aged 10-29 years in Ohio. The specificaims of our proposed project are: 1) to compare 2010 national and Ohio poisoning control centers' data toidentify major drugs that are responsible for drug poisonings in adolescents and young adults in Ohio; 2) toassess the trends of drug poisonings in adolescents and young adults from 2000-2011 in Ohio; 3) tocompare rate of drug poisonings at the county level and to identify counties that have higher than the stateaverage rate of drug poisonings. Our research activities proposed in aims 1 and 2 is expected to identify themajor drugs that are responsible for drug poisonings in Ohio adolescents and young adults. Aim 3 isexpected to allow us to identify target areas for future intervention programs. To help translate our researchfindings into drug poisoning interventions in Ohio, we plan: 1) to disseminate our findings at local stakeholdermeetings; 2) to publish a special report; and 3) to submit and publish one peer-reviewed journal article. Theproposed project is significant because findings from this project are needed to guide intervention programsto prevent drug overdoses and poisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Drug overdoses and poisonings have become a major public health problem in the U.S. in recent years. Theproposed research project will provide statistical data about drug poisonings among adolescents and youngadults in Ohio, which could be used to guide intervention programs to prevent drug overdoses andpoisonings in local communities.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name: Center for Injury Research and PolicyDUNS:Street 1: 700 Children's Drive Street 2:City: Columbus County: Franklin State: OhioProvince: Country: USA Zip/Postal Code: 43205Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 6/09) Page 2 Form Page 2Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Xiang Small Research Project)SENIOR/KEY PERSONNEL.

Children 5-12years of age are unlikely to be awakened by a conventional residential tone smoke alarm. However, findingsfrom our preliminary research strongly suggest that an effective and practical alarm for this age group isachievable. Building on our previous work, the objective of the first phase of this study is to determine keysmoke alarm characteristics that will awaken children and prompt their escape. The objective of the secondphase of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the child voice smoke alarm in awakening olderadults 65-84 years of age. Using a randomized, non-blinded, repeated measures, clinical interventiondesign, the objective of the first phase of the study will be achieved in two linked studies. Study 1 (currentlyongoing) will identify the critical elements (i.e., use of child's first name and/or behavior commands inmessage content) in the maternal voice alarm that are significantly associated with polysomnography-defined awakening and successful completion of simulated escape behaviors by children after awakeningfrom slow wave sleep. Study 2 will take the voice alarm script that was the most successful in Study 1 inawakening and prompting children to perform the simulated escape behaviors, and will compare mother'svoice to a female stranger's voice using this script. In addition, a low frequency 520 Hz square wave tonesmoke alarm will be included as a stimulus in Study 2 to evaluate the influence of alarm signal frequency onawakening. Study 3 will take the voice alarm script in Study 2 and compare it with a 520 Hz square wavetone smoke alarm and a hybrid (520 Hz square wave tone and voice) alarm in awakening older adults age65-84 years old from slow wave sleep and prompting their performance of a simulated escape procedure. Aconventional residential tone smoke alarm will be the reference stimulus in all three studies. The research ishighly innovative, because 1) sleep stage is monitored, which is a critical factor influencing sleep arousal, 2)subjects perform a simulated escape procedure (in addition to awakening, people must escape to survive aresidential fire), and 3) the influence of sleep inertia on performance of the escape procedure is assessed.RELEVANCE (See instructions):The proposed research is significant, because it will allow the development, for the first time, of an effectiveand practical smoke alarm for children and older adults, which would provide an opportunity to reduce fire-related morbidity and mortality.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)Project/Performance Site Primary LocationOrganizational Name: Center for Injury Research and Policy, The Research Institute, Nationwide Children's HospDUNS:Street 1: 700 Children's Drive Street 2:City: Columbus County: Franklin State: OhioProvince: Country: USA Zip/Postal Code: 43205Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:Additional Project/Performance Site LocationOrganizational Name:DUNS:Street 1: Street 2:City: County: State:Province: Country: Zip/Postal Code:Project/Performance Site Congressional Districts:PHS 398 (Rev. 6/09) Page 2 Form Page 2Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Smith, Gary (Smith Small Research Project)SENIOR/KEY PERSONNEL.

      "OF THE RESEARCH PLAN The studies to be pursued under the proposed extension fall within three general areas: i) enzyme catalystengineering and modulation (theme 1); ii) selected platform applications (theme 2); and iii) a systematic studyof the impact of glycosylation on fundamental drug properties (theme 3). The key tenets of each are brieflydescribed below and parallel the consistently high level of significance and innovation reflected in past periodsof support. The overarching significance stems from the anticipated advancements of universal principles forenzyme catalyst engineering/modulation, novel enabling strategies for synthesis and biosynthetic study, uniqueprobes or leads of significance to diverse therapeutic areas, and a potential new conceptual framework for thegeneral use of glycosylation in drug development. Anticipated drivers of innovation are both by design(particularly novel synthetic and assay strategies) and directed discovery (unprecedented glycosyltransferasemodulators and probes/leads with high potential to lead to new understanding in the fundamentals ofimmunomodulation and/or inflammation). Studies directed toward enzyme catalyst engineering and modulation (theme 1) will focus on comparing thedirected evolutionary paths among the structurally similar glycosyltransferases (GTs) OleD and OleI, assessingthe transferability of beneficial mutations across OleD and OleI and identifying mutational hot spots within theatypical GTB-fold GT AmphD1. The comparative OleD/OleI studies will consist of: i) the evaluation of an ‘OleILoki,’ which contains the 5 key mutations of structurally conserved residues that led to OleD Loki; and ii) aparallel epPCR-directed evolution approach for increasing OleI proficiency/permissivity using the same screensand mutational strategy that led to the discovery of enhanced OleD progeny. Key outcomes of this comparativestudy will be a potential universal blueprint for improving the proficiency/promiscuity of most GTB-fold GTs andimproved GTs for select sugar-conjugation (D-Gal analogs) to support theme 3. The directed evolution ofAmphD1 (and parallel proposed structure elucidation and structure-based engineering) will also follow our OleDprecedent and offers both the potential to expand the universal GT engineering blueprint toward atypical GTsand to identify GT variants to dramatically simplify the targeted synthesis of the unique preclinical antifungal lead2’-epi-amphotericin (theme 2). In addition, we will pursue the mechanistic study of small molecule inhibitors andactivators identified via the ClNP-Glc-based HT screen - studies that hold high potential in the discovery of newparadigms for GT catalytic modulation that may extend to other enzyme families and/or have pharmacologicapplications. Finally, while we remain enthusiastic about the uncharted frontier of enzyme modulation viacontrolled electrical fields, such technically challenging experiments require the physical presence of both thematerials scientists and enzymologists and, unfortunately, our local collaborator (Prof. Hinds) recently relocatedto the University of Washington. Thus, this has become a lower priority in the near term. Among the various selected platform applications (theme 2), we will direct the real-time NMR-based assaytoward key and novel late-stage biosynthetic transformations - specifically, to understand the stepwiseaminopentose N-alkylation reactions en route to enediynes and indolocarbazoles and the key steps of enediyne-associated thiosugar biosynthesis. The main outcome of these studies will be the elucidation of what isanticipated to be (based on bioinformatics) novel enzyme-catalyzed chemistries. In addition, we will continue theongoing studies discussed within the progress report (immunomodulatory studies with macrolide neoglycosides,anti-Mtb studies with spectinomycin neoglycosides, and further advancing protein glycosylation studies) andinitiate new combined (neo)glycorandomization diversification efforts toward a prioritized list of additional targets.Specifically, we seek to generate and evaluate (neo)glycorandomized libraries of a third or fourth generation -lactam antibiotic (primary objective to broaden antibacterial scope), rapamycin (primary objectives to assessmechanistic modulation and potency), and daptomycin (primary objectives to improve formulation, potencyand/or antibacterial scope). For all targets selected, we have access to the necessary fundamental evaluativeactivity assays within my lab or via the Center of Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (under mydirectorship) and these new initiatives hold promise for the discovery of new potential anti-infective, anticancerand/or immunomodulatory probes/leads and for advancing new tools for biopharmaceutical development. As highlighted in the progress report, we have also initiated arguably one of the first broad systematic studiesof the impact of glycosylation on fundamental drug properties (theme 3), the strategic design of which will probeboth the impact of the sugar and corresponding drug leaving group on key drug property principles. Thecorresponding in vitro and in vivo drug properties of the -glucosides will be evaluated by Vertex. In parallel,Prof. Leggas (co-I) will evaluate the in vitro and in vivo drug properties of a SN-38 10-O--glycoside sugar variantseries from which the top 2-3 analogs will be selected for subsequent in vivo anticancer efficacy studies. Thesestudies are anticipated to reveal fundamental insights regarding the impact of the sugar, drug and correspondingglycosidic bond as the basis of a potentially new conceptual framework for the general use of glycosylation as atransformative drug development tool.Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Thorson, JonDETAILED BUDGET FOR INITIAL BUDGET PERIOD DIRECT COSTS ONLYFROM07/01/2016THROUGH06/30/2017List PERSONNEL (Applicant organization only)Use Cal, Acad, or Summer to Enter Months Devoted to ProjectEnter Dollar Amounts Requested (omit cents) for Salary Requested and Fringe BenefitsNAMEThorson, JonLeggas, MarkosZhang, JianjunHughes, RyanEckenrode, JosephROLE ONPROJECTCal.MnthsAcad.MnthsSummerMnthsINST.BASESALARYSALARYREQUESTEDFRINGEBENEFITSPD/PI 2.40 183,300 36,660 9,929Co-I 0.36 121,097 3,633 1,093Postdoc 12 44,803 44,803 14,656Grad Student 12 24,000 24,000 4,524Grad Student 12 24,000 24,000 4,524  133,096 34,726 167,822TOTAL46,5894,72659,45928,52428,524SUBTOTALSCONSULTANT COSTSEQUIPMENT (Itemize)SUPPLIES (Itemize by category)Tissue culture, cell biology, molecular biology, biochemical, chemical reagents, waste disposalBioanalytical reagents/suppliesLC/MS/MS maintenanceAnimal costs107,775TRAVELtravel to scientific meetings3,000INPATIENT CARE COSTSOUTPATIENT CARE COSTSALTERATIONS AND RENOVATIONS (Itemize by category)OTHER EXPENSES (Itemize by category)graduate student tuition, publication costs.16,666CONSORTIUM/CONTRACTUAL COSTSDIRECT COSTSSUBTOTAL DIRECT COSTS FOR INITIAL BUDGET PERIOD (Item 7a, Face Page) $ 295,263CONSORTIUM/CONTRACTUAL COSTSFACILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTSTOTAL DIRECT COSTS FOR INITIAL BUDGET PERIOD $ 295,263PHS 398 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) OMB No. 0925-0001 Page Form Page 4\n",

      "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hadjiargyrou, MichaelPROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):Cartilage is the initial tissue of the skeleton that forms during embryonic development and participates inendochondral ossification of bones during growth and fracture repair. Chondrogenesis and subsequentbone formation is a complex process that is guided by cellular events ultimately governed by geneticnetworks. Identifying key regulatory genes of chondrogenesis is essential in enhancing our understanding,not only of cartilage formation, but also of skeletal pathologies and repair. The main objective of thisproposal is to establish a functional relationship between Mustn1 (discovered in my laboratory) andchondrogenesis by generating and characterizing Mustn1 conditional knockout (KO) mice. Previously, weshowed Mustn1 to be robustly expressed in the developing skeletal system; to display differential temporaland spatial expression in proliferating chondrocytes of articular cartilage and cartilaginous fracture callus,necessary for chondrogenic proliferation and differentiation in vitro; and, when silenced, to downregulatecartilage-related genes, thus leading to severe cartilage deficits during development in vivo. We plan toextend these findings and test the hypothesis that Mustn1 is a key regulator in chondrocytes and is requiredfor cartilage formation during embryonic development and fracture repair. To address this hypothesis, wewill generate Mustn1 conditional (in cartilage) KO mice and assess its role during skeletal development andgrowth (Aim 1) and fracture repair (Aim 2). By examining the consequences of Mustn1 deletion inchondrocytes, its functional contribution to chondrogenesis and overall skeletal development and repair willbe clearly deciphered. We are hopeful that in the future, this will enable us to address a major challenge inorthopaedic medicine, that is, cartilage regeneration necessary to repair joint surface defects arising fromtrauma or arthritis, as well as impaired fracture repair (i.e. delayed and nonunions). Moreover, as Mustn1does not belong to any known class of proteins, its investigation may lead to the elucidation of a new anduncharacterized protein family and/or regulatory pathways vital to chondrogenesis. Lastly, these transgenicmice will be available and serve as useful experimental tools for many investigators working on variouscellular and molecular aspects of cartilage biology.PROJECT/PERFORMANCE SITE(S) (if additional space is needed, use Project/Performance Site Format Page)New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)Stony Brook University (SBU)PHS 398 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018) OMB No. 0925-0001 Page 2 Form Page 2\n",

      "Contact PD/PI: Guo, Ju-TaoTITLEEvaluation of therapeutic benefits of HBV nucleocapsid assembly inhibitorsABSTRACTThis is a proposal to determine the feasibility and therapeutic benefits of newly discovered benzamidederivatives (BAs) as mono-therapeutic agents or in combination with nucleoside analogues for the treatment ofchronic hepatitis B. BAs were identified in our laboratory as inhibitors of hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic(pg) RNA encapsidation, which is essential for the subsequent viral DNA synthesis. They are mechanisticallydistinct from, and should thus complement, the currently FDA-approved antiviral medications. In addition,inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation, or the nucleocapsid assembly, should not only preclude HBV genomereplication and virion production, it might also disrupt the metabolism of HBV pgRNA-reverse transcriptase(RT) complex and core protein, which could consequentially interfere with the host innate antiviral immuneresponse and cccDNA function in the infected hepatocytes. Unlike other pgRNA encapsidation inhibitorsreported thus far, our benzamide pgRNA encapsidation inhibitors also effectively inhibit woodchuck hepatitisvirus (WHV), which allows for the evaluation of the therapeutic benefits of this class of antivirals in ahepadnavirus chronically infected animal model for the first time. We, therefore, propose in this project toperform further lead optimization, and advance compounds with the most favorable ADME, safety andpharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for antiviral efficacy study in the WHV-infected woodchucks in vivo. Meanwhile,we will continue our efforts toward understanding the molecular mechanism by which BAs inhibit HBVnucleocapsid assembly and their consequential impacts on the interaction between HBV and its hosthepatocytes. At the completion of this project, we will have a better understanding of the potential clinicalbenefits of pgRNA encapsidation-targeted antiviral therapy, either alone or in combination with nucleosideanalogues in particular, and strategic insights in to the development of antiviral regimes for the cure of chronichepatitis B infection in general. A decision on further preclinical/clinical development of the lead BAscompounds will be made accordingly.Project Summary/Abstract Page 7\n",

      "Contact PD/PI: Li, King C.Project Summary/AbstractA critical issue that impedes advances in public health is the chasm between what we know can improvehealth and what is implemented in everyday practice. In addition, to have the highest impact, diverseparticipants should be involved in all types of clinical and translational research, to ensure both the relevanceof research findings to the general population and the likelihood that they can be disseminated to improvepublic health in a meaningful way. Finally, implementation of research findings requires that translationalresearch occurs in an efficient and organized environment. All of these activities are critical to a learning healthcare system by providing the foundation for information feedback loops, team-based learning and investigation,stakeholder participation, opportunities for education, continuous improvement, and sustainability. The missionof the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute (TSI) is to provide an innovative, efficient, and sustainableresearch infrastructure to accelerate WF's transformation, and thus speed the translation of discoveries toimprove health. The purpose of this Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) application is tosynergize the fundamental positive changes that the TSI has already brought to bear at Wake Forest BaptistHealth. The TSI has already made substantive progress to develop and augment our translational workforce;provide outstanding support in biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design; and assure that our researchcomplies with regulatory guidelines and meets ethical standards. Our rapidly growing Clinically IntegratedNetwork will aggregate data from our affiliates to provide an extraordinarily rich source of clinical information toinform new research directions, facilitated by our biomedical informatics expertise. We can offer to the CTSAnetwork our resources and expertise in building efficient clinical research support programs and extensiveexperience in the conduct of multi-center clinical research, especially studies focused on older adults, in whichour track record is exemplary. The TSI also has model programs in community engagement, team science,and recruitment of special populations into translational research. We propose novel experimental approachesthat will test methodologies to advance the science of translational science. In particular, we can offer ourworld-class capabilities to support the use of nonhuman primate models for research of high translational valueto public health. With CTSA support, we can use this comprehensive infrastructure to fund new pilot projectsand new multidisciplinary research teams, and offer innovative training to help those ventures succeed. WakeForest Baptist Health is a fully integrated medical center in which governance, quality improvement, andresearch discoveries – including the intellectual property that may result from those discoveries – are highlyaligned. In summary, the TSI is poised to be a productive hub within the CTSA network.Project Summary/Abstract Page 203Contact PD/PI: Li, King C.\n",

      "Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P NRSA-Training-001 (251)We propose the CCTS TL1 Training Program in Comparative Effectiveness & Patient Centered OutcomesResearch. This program recognizes that the clinical and translational research (CTR) workforce has an urgentneed to expand in the fields of comparative effectiveness research (CER) and patient centered outcomesresearch (PCOR). The overall goal is to grow the pipeline of candidates for careers in CER/PCOR by offeringformative research opportunities to early stage trainees. The TL1 specific aims are to: 1) Draw from pools of pre-doctoral students in MD and PharmD programs across the CCTS Partner Network each year to identify and recruit 20 of the most promising and diverse students for two components of a CER/PCOR focused TL1 program: A) A year-long research intensive immersion experience for 10 students/year; and B) An introductory 8-week summer program for 10 students/year; 2) Provide multidisciplinary didactic curricula for these programs to ensure that TL1 Trainees have foundational knowledge and experience that will prepare them to advance in their careers. In the year-long program, trainees will choose a clinical research-focused master’s program (i.e., MSPH, MS) at either UAB or Tulane. These programs will share common didactic activities and other joint activities presented via videoconference to promote training in CER/PCOR. The 8-week program will occur between the first and second year of a trainee’s clinical program, while the year-long program will be a ‘year out’ from the trainee’s clinical education program, to permit obtaining the MSPH/MS degree and performing mentored research prior to graduating from their clinical program; 3) Provide and evaluate program and long-term career development support via individual and team-based mentoring that will promote the acquisition of methodological skills and other core competencies required for success as independent investigators. Our novel program’s research and training base is drawn from across 7 Schools at the CCTS Hub and at Tulane, including 35 Primarymentors and 25 Associate mentors.Through this unique combination of an introductory summer program and a year-long intensive program, theTL1 will introduce the CER/PCOR investigator pipeline into the pre-clinical period growing the pool of futureCTR investigators.\n",

      "Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert PThe vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Hub is to reduce health disparities indiseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve humanhealth. We have established a robust Partner Network – spanning Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana – toensure that our research and training efforts serve the special populations in our region while maximizingcollaborative synergies in translational research (Aim 1). We promote the continued development of a diverse,multidisciplinary research workforce representing all career stages, by supporting a broad portfolio of NRSAtraining, mentored career development, content specific educational programs and experiential learningopportunities (Aim 2). These initiatives deepen scientific understanding of clinical and translational science,establish core competencies and advance the knowledge base in good clinical practice, study design,bioethics, conduct of clinical trials and team science. The CCTS supports ethical, scientifically rigorous clinicaltrials and pilot research across the CCTS Partner Network (Aim 3) through focused efforts to provideresources, specialized services and consultation in genomics, informatics, biostatistics and epidemiology,clinical research, advanced imaging and drug discovery. The CCTS fosters the application of best practices,including those established by the CTSA Consortium, and will promote tools that enable the rapid and efficientexecution of multi-site clinical trials, taking advantage of the electronic health record to inform feasibility andaccess to study populations. Importantly, in keeping with our goal of reducing regional health disparities, werecognize the importance of engaging our communities in the planning and conduct of research (Aim 4).Through our community engagement arm – One Great Community – we are expanding programmatic outreachby taking successful community-based participatory research approaches to a regional scale. Finally, weunderstand the importance of evaluating the activities of the CCTS Partner Network to ensure that we areaccomplishing our goals (Aim 5). Didactic programs, community engagement and research processes areevaluated by a panel of tailored and common metrics to guide strategies and outline progress towardsachieving defined goals. By achieving these aims, the CCTS Partner Network will accelerate clinical andtranslational research in the Deep South and advance the amelioration the significant health disparities facedby our populations. Further, the CCTS Hub and its Partner Network will be well-positioned to work with otherhubs and the CTSA Consortium in the dissemination of best practices in clinical and translational research andtraining.Project Summary/Abstract Page 248Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P\n",

The UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) will enable a widerange of translational research conducted at our institution and in our region in an environment of exceptionalquality, safety and efficiency. We will empower programs and talent unique to our Hub that will fosterinnovation and continuous improvement enriching the entire national network. We will create and track novelprograms in each of the essential areas outlined by NCATS: 1) Workforce Development: Trainees (at boththe K and NRSA levels) will harness strengths at UCI, including existing immersive training programs in areassuch as systems biology that can shorten and improve the training experience. Community-universityexternships will provide wide-ranging experiential learning including “health and the judicial system” and “drugdiscovery in local start-ups.” Our clinical trainees will play an integral role in workforce development of all staff,such as our recently developed certification program for study coordinators. Particular talent at UCI in both thescience and implementation of team science resulted in a Team Science Core Curriculum, which will beintegrated into all ICTS training. 2) Collaboration and Engagement: The ICTS ecosystem is one in which ouracademic health center actively collaborates with regional partners: the freestanding Children’s Hospital ofOrange County (CHOC), the local VA, and a growing community-based accountable care organization in ourregion. The ICTS will lead an institutional and regional effort to improve quality and efficiency, preparing us asa Hub poised to excel in multicenter clinical investigations. By engaging the successful clinical trial experienceof our faculty, building on years of effective community outreach, our integration with community clinics, andadvanced EHR cohort discovery tools, the clinical trials Accrual and Retention Core is designed to optimallyrecruit from the youngest of the young (premature babies) to the oldest of the old (90+), and from typicallyunderrepresented groups in clinical research. 3) Integration: Child health research will be fostered through:collaborations with the AAP Pediatric Research in Office Settings network; a formal Research Strategic Planwith CHOC; and through an Optional Module with nineteen other CTSAs (Child Health Research Accelerationthrough Multisite Planning). 4) Methods and Processes: Our involvement with the consortium of the five UCCTSAs (BRAID–Biomedical Research Acceleration Integration and Development) has served as a testingground of novel approaches for multisite research. BRAID-initiated Trust-and-Rely IRB and the UC-ResearchExchange cohort discovery tool are being integrated into the NCATS ACT project.

The distribution ofunderrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projectedfor the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for ourCTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities inour community, which represents a “population of the future”. Improving health in our community and thenation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, theUniversity at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center(CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility,including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facilityand a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic HealthCenter creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries inthe laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise andinnovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to theCTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leadingcenter on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developedwith our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; andone of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium. With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of newhealthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translationalresearchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build atranslational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methodsto discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processeswith a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups withhealth disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation.

Inst-Career-Dev-001 (530)ABSTRACT: MENTORED CAREER DEVELOPMENTThe future of medical research depends critically on the success of training programs in attracting talentedyoung scientists and providing them the education that will allow them to succeed in a rapidly changingmedical research environment, one characterized increasingly by cross disciplinary research carried out byteams of researchers. The future of translational and clinical research will also involve greater use ofinformatics and an orientation to develop discoveries for commercial application. To be successful in pursuingresearch careers, scholars need to have translational research skills and traditional competencies like skill inwriting papers and grants. For scholars and faculty to succeed in a new more complex and evolving researchenvironment, they need to have familiarity with and/or mastery of a broad set of disciplines and must be avidcollaborators and lifelong learners. At the Boston University CTSI, we recognize these needs and have crafteda career development program that addresses them.The proposed mentored career development program at the Boston University CTSI builds upon a successfulK30 (called the CREST program) targeted toward postdoctoral scholars and a KL2 program targeted to juniorfaculty. It will target postdoctoral and junior faculty scholars and include a KL2 program that provides stipendsfor 3 scholars per year. Features of that program included structured team mentoring, matriculation in one ofmany degree programs in areas of translational research, and a works in progress seminar program andtraining in grant writing, writing papers and other necessary skills. Evaluation included assessment for corecompetencies and overlapping surveys about curriculum, seminars and mentoring. To enhancemultidisciplinary education and to broaden our scholars career options, the proposed multifaceted programbuilds upon this foundation, adding the following: a workshop on training the mentor, a shared regionalmentoring program, a new degree and seminar series on drug and device development, new opportunities toparticipate in team and multidisciplinary science and a mini sabbatical program to encourage scholars toacquire skills or knowledge beyond their own discipline.The evaluation of our education program will incorporate state of the art metrics to assess current performanceof the programs, thereby permitting real time modifications and will also measure team science successes.

The proposed program will enhance the career development, translational capabilities, andcollaborative skills of faculty and scientists from diverse disciplines. Recruitment efforts will be targeted atinvestigators with research or health professional doctorates in medicine, pediatrics, surgery, dentistry,nursing, allied health, pharmacology, health care administration and management, clinical research design,epidemiology, biostatistics, biomedical informatics, economics, quality improvement, modeling systems,bioethics, engineering, and behavioral science. Program graduates will receive excellent career mentoring, andwill also gain expertise in advanced CTS methods and experimental approaches that will allow them tocompete more effectively for external funding in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, andultimately to contribute to an interdisciplinary workforce and enhanced translational ability to prevent and treatdiseases. Our goals are to: (i) develop innovative education and career development programs, building onand extending our many successful existing programs, that will enhance the ability of our scholars and traineesto engage in interdisciplinary teamwork, make new discoveries, and translate those discoveries to patientbenefit; (ii) demonstrate the effectiveness of those programs through continuous monitoring and assessmentfor quality improvement, using key metrics to evaluate the impact of our educational programs on researchoutput, career trajectories, and continued engagement in biomedical research; and (iii) disseminate findingson novel educational delivery approaches, new methods for assessing student learning, and best practices inenhancing interdisciplinary team science skills to our partners at Columbia, the members of the CTSAconsortium, and educational programs throughout the nation. Given our track record and outstanding applicantpool, we are ready to undertake the proposed aims and we are confident that we can achieve our traininggoals, which will expedite the development of the next generation of CTS researchers who will not onlycontribute substantially to clinical and translational research, but will also perform as effective members andleaders of diverse and interdisciplinary scientific teams, with the ability to advance partnerships with industry,patient advocacy groups, our local community in Northern Manhattan and Harlem, and other stakeholdergroups. We believe that our program will be successful due to the outstanding CUMC research portfolio, our10+ years of experience in administering successful training and mentoring programs, our investment in thenational efforts towards research competencies and mentor development, and the personnel and electronicinfrastructure provided by our CTSA resources. We are poised to contribute substantially to NIH's goal ofbuilding a larger, diverse, and well-prepared CTS workforce.Project Summary/Abstract Page 718Contact PD/PI: GINSBERG, HENRY N Inst-Career-Dev-001 (788)I.

      "Contact PD/PI: Sinoway, Lawrence IsaacPROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT – OVERALLIn 2007 the Penn State Clinical and Translational Science Institute was formed (CTSI, termed the “Institute” inthis application) to advance biomedical research to better predict, prevent and treat human disease. PennState has over $800 million of research expenditures and its College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, isa thriving institution serving over 2 million people. The region is racially and ethnically diverse with a mix ofurban, suburban, and rural populations with many being disadvantaged and elderly. As a major land-grantuniversity Penn State has developed a large outreach network affording the opportunity to rapidly identifycommunity needs and deploy new healthcare approaches.This is a new CTSA application that builds upon our efforts since 2007 to reshape clinical and translationalscience (CTS). We are a learning organization that has developed and implemented methods, metrics andprocesses to continually assess our performance and progress. Going forward we will continue to seek inputfrom our advisory committees, the CTSA Consortium and NCATS to deliver on the promise of improved healththrough discovery, development and dissemination of new knowledge. A key underpinning for our vision forCTS is that multidisciplinary teamwork is critical for success. We propose the following aims:Aim 1. Catalyze team science by engaging scientists, professionals and communities across and outsidetraditional biomedical boundaries from within and beyond Penn State. We will increase the reach of ourInstitute and will promote health and treat disease across the lifespan through enhanced integration andgreater interactions with the diverse communities we serve.Aim 2. Promote the highest quality CTS through the provision of investigator-centered research infrastructurethat accelerates protocol development and study completion. We will expand and continually assess ourresource support including informatics, research methods, pilot project funding and clinical services within aculture that highlights ethics and concern for the heath care needs of an increasingly diverse population.Aim 3. Effectively and bidirectionally share resources and expertise through collaborations with other CTSAHUBs, the CTSA Consortium and more broadly with providers and the population at large. We will dramaticallyimprove clinical trials and the processes of recruitment and trial innovation. This will accelerate the rate atwhich discovery is disseminated and translated into clinical care and improved health.Aim 4. Educating a new generation of health professionals and CTS investigators. The Institute will be thefocal point for the education of a diverse CTS workforce of scholars and professionals. Our workforce will benot only fluent in cutting edge CTS methods but will also be cognizant of the health concerns of diversepopulations and the ethical issues that will arise as CTS is conducted. Project Summary/Abstract Page 224Contact PD/PI: Sinoway, Lawrence Isaac\n",

      "Contact PD/PI: Kovacs, Elizabeth J7. Project Summary / AbstractThis R13 meetings grant application seeks partial support for three upcoming annual Alcohol andImmunology Research Interest Group (AIRIG) meetings in conjunction with either the Midwest AutumnImmunology Conference (AIC) in Chicago, IL or the Society for Leukocyte Biology (SLB). Funding isrequested to cover travel costs and housing for students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty and minorityscientists, as well as some of the cost of invited speakers, for a one day meeting which will cover broadaspects of alcohol and immunology with a sub-theme. The sub-theme for 2015 meeting will be“Neuroimmunoendocrine Effects of Alcohol.” The 2015 meeting will be held on Saturday September 27th inconjunction with the 2015 meeting of the SLB in Raleigh, NC. We plan to hold the two subsequent AIRIGmeetings at Loyola University Chicago in 2016 and 2017 as one-day satellite meetings the day before thestart of the three-day long Chicago based AIC meeting. The themes of the latter two meeting will be“Mechanisms of Alcohol Responses” and “Alcohol, Inflammation and Tissue Response to Injury.” SLBmeetings have between 300 - 500 registrants depending on the venue and if the meeting is solo or joint withother small scientific societies. AIC is a regional meeting with over 450 registrants and an impressive list ofinvited plenary speakers from around the United States. Holding the AIRIG meeting with AIC or SLB willallow greater visibility of alcohol and immunology research than would be possible at much larger meetingslike the American Association of Immunologists or Experimental Biology. Additionally, both have multipleopportunities for young developing scientist (student and postdoctoral fellows) to participate on many levels.At AIC and SLB meetings, a large number of oral presentations are selected from submitted abstracts. Inaddition, both meetings have Career Development Programs, including sessions and workshops entitledCareers in Immunology, Meet the Program Officer, Women and Diversity, Grant Writing, Streets Smarts ofScience for Students and Understanding the Individual Development Plan indicating commitment to traineesat all levels. These sessions allow time for career building and collaborative opportunities, which may not befeasible or readily available at larger meetings. Thus, in addition to providing a forum for the discussion ofcurrent research in the field, overall goals of the co-organizers are to expand the participation of students,postdoctoral trainees and minority scientists and increase the critical mass of scientists working on alcoholand immunology issues. We believe that these goals will be best achieved by scheduling upcoming AIRIGmeetings in conjunction with the AIC and SLB Annual Meetings.Project Summary/Abstract Page 6\n",

Drew University of Medicine and Science and the Los Angeles BiomedicalInstitute at Harbor UCLA Medical Center. Its mission is to bring biomedical innovations to bear on the greatesthealth needs of Los Angeles—the largest and one of the most ethnically, socially and economically diversecounties in the United States. In doing so, our goal is to become a leading contributor in the CTSA Consortiumand speed scientific translation to benefit the nation as a whole. The CTSI has five aims: (1) Prepare thetranslational workforce to conduct high-quality, multidisciplinary team science; (2) Engage stakeholdercommunities in clinical and translational research and disseminate successful models ofcollaboration; (3) Integrate special populations, especially those experiencing health disparities, intoresearch; (4) Improve methods and processes to accelerate scientific translation, overcome keyroadblocks and support multisite research; (5) Provide informatics solutions to operational andscientific roadblocks to advance high-impact translational science within the UCLA CTSI and the CTSAnetwork. Our novel infrastructure includes: The Los Angeles Data Resource (LADR), a federation of clinicaldata warehouses from six Los Angeles institutions; its governance agreement serves as the model for theCTSA ACT initiative; an Innovation and Implementation Core with Los Angeles County, a laboratory for testingapproaches for improving care for the nearly 700,000 people annually treated in the county health system; aPrecision Medicine program that forms the infrastructure to bring genomic-level diagnosis to translationalinvestigation and clinical care across our UCLA Hub, multiple CTSAs and partner institutions; a trainingprogram that integrates entrepreneurship principles in on-the-job training experiences in which investigatorsare guided to utilize their own findings as they bring their discoveries to products. We propose to transform ourCTSI from a high-functioning service organization into a well-integrated research accelerator that will develop,demonstrate and disseminate novel solutions to translational roadblocks, to the ultimate benefit of the LosAngeles community, our region and the nation.Project Summary/Abstract Page 745Contact PD/PI: Dubinett, Steven M.OVERALL\n",
